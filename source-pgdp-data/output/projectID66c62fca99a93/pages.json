  "007.png": "\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nWHEN I wrote of \"French Painters\" and of \"French\r\nArchitects and Sculptors,\" I separated works of\r\ndecoration, with some reluctance, from \"Architecture\r\nand Painting,\" in order to group them as a\r\nnecessary background to \"Furniture,\" for a cabinet, or a table,\r\ndemands, if it have character, the accessories which determined\r\nthat character, or it becomes a mere curiosity.\r\n\r\nWe have now in London many of the finest examples produced\r\nby French cabinet-makers in the eighteenth century. Unfortunately,\r\nthe possession of fine furniture does not always mean\r\nits preservation. The recent treatment of the treasures in one\r\ngreat collection has given us an illustration of the ruin that may\r\nbe wrought by untrained zeal. Years ago Mr. Ruskin wrote of\r\nhis efforts to make a record of certain work at Florence before it\r\nshould be \"touched up with new gilding for the mob.\" This\r\npassage must occur to the minds of many who visit Hertford\r\nHouse, and see the injury there due in many cases to the fatal\r\nhabit of \"gilding for the mob.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"mob,\" in the sense given to it by Mr. Ruskin, is\r\nindeed a noun of multitude signifying many, and, strictly speaking,\r\nincludes those drawing-room dilettanti who so often show us that\r\nit is quite possible to love beautiful things for qualities other than\r\nthose to which they owe their beauty. It may be well, therefore,\r\nto remind those who compete for the possession of costly furniture\r\nand toys; who are charmed by cabinets and what-nots from the\r\npanels of which S\u00e8vres looks out as clean and inharmonious as on\r\nthe day of its insertion, that the chief beauty of these things does\r\nnot lie in the glitter of gold, in microscopic finish, or in the\r\nunfading brilliance of china plaques. Nay more, even delicacies",
  "008.png": "and graces of expression--finish of inlay, sharpness of carving and\r\nof chiselling--are worthless unless sustained by sense of style and\r\nrespect for the laws of construction.\r\n\r\nThese virtues, predominant in all periods of great and noble\r\nart, are obvious in the work of the earlier masters of the eighteenth\r\ncentury in France, and although their force may be sadly\r\ndiminished, it is nevertheless due to some hint of their presence\r\nthat we recognize excellence in the craft of later years. Whether\r\nin things great or small, sense of style and respect for the laws of\r\nconstruction are the two tests by which we may measure the\r\nclaims of any work of art to our respect and admiration. Were it\r\nnot for their influence the priceless trifles which the millionaire\r\nguards behind plate glass, the gold-mounted cups of rock crystal\r\nor of S\u00e8vres, the enamels, the chiselled snuff-boxes, which serve as\r\na setting for the miniatures of Hall, or the microscopic art of\r\nvan Blarenberghe--even if interesting as human documents--would\r\nhave no more title to honour from an artistic point of view,\r\nthan the wax-flowers which the thrifty mistress of a country inn\r\nprotects from houseflies with a glass shade. This is a hard saying,\r\nfor alluring prettiness of shining metal, gay china, and marvels of\r\nfinish are readily appreciated by any who live in costly surroundings;\r\nbut the values of style and construction demand some\r\nsacrifice, they can be recognized only by effort, patient attention,\r\nand cultivated habits of observation.\r\n\r\nThe credit of the fine work done in France during this century\r\nhas actually suffered in the eyes of those who have given time and\r\nstudy to these things from the undeserved importance given by the\r\ntaste of the wealthy to the least worthy achievements. I hope\r\nthat these pages may do something towards redressing the balance.\r\nIn their illustration I have again received the experienced help of\r\nM. Rouam. I have to thank Mme. Pallain for the photographs\r\nfrom which I reproduce the \"Galerie Dor\u00e9e;\" M. Guiffrey,\r\nM. Eug\u00e8ne Muntz, M. Molinier, and M. Fenaille have lent\r\nothers of importance which I was unable to procure for myself;\r\nnor among the least of my obligations is that to M. J. Doucet for\r\npermission to use, in illustration of a most graceful form of late\r\ndecoration, the doors painted by Fragonard which are in his\r\npossession. To the active and liberal officials of the South\r\nKensington Museum, especially to Mr. Purdon Clarke and Mr.\r\nSkinner, I am most grateful. The readiness of the Keeper of the\r\nWallace collection to facilitate the study of the works under his\r\ncare, I have found shortened only by the scanty powers accorded\r\nhim, and I am, therefore, the more obliged to Mr. Austen",
  "009.png": "Chamberlain for the prompt intervention which procured for me,\r\nfrom the Trustees, the permission to photograph the lustre by\r\nJacques Caffieri, which, both on account of its fine style and the\r\nrare signature which it bears, is a work of exceptional interest.\r\nIn its present position, however, it is so ill-seen that the results\r\nobtained by a skilled operator were but indifferent, and the photograph\r\nfrom which it is here reproduced is one that shows it\r\nhanging in its original place at Old Hertford House.\r\n\r\nAs to this point, I am often asked why I take so much trouble\r\nto procure recent photographs for the illustrations of these volumes\r\ninstead of employing the admirable drawings and engravings\r\nalready existing of the subjects of which I write. My intention\r\nhas been to give, as far as possible, documents representing the\r\nactual condition of the works in question; but I look forward to\r\nutilizing both the sources indicated in their proper place, that is to\r\nsay, in the volume on the \"Draughtsmen and Engravers\" with\r\nwhich I propose to close this work.\r\n\r\nEmilia F.

His costly collections and magnificent\r\ncommissions were no image of his private tastes; they but played\r\na part in that splendid conception of the State which demanded\r\nthat all the interests of the nation should be reflected by its ruler.\r\n\r\nWhen this ideal disappeared, when the powerful organization\r\ncreated by Le Brun gave way and the rule of Versailles could no\r\nlonger be maintained, the cessation of supreme and authoritative\r\ndirection left open the door to a bewildering crowd of conflicting\r\ntendencies. On this account alone the systematic treatment of the\r\nart of the eighteenth century bristles with difficulties, which\r\npresent themselves with special force in all forms of decoration.\r\nIt is true that during the course of the century we can trace the\r\ngradual triumph of the straight line and the growing allegiance to\r\nclassic motives, but the main development was crossed by many\r\ncontrary influences. Grotesque, realistic and classic elements of\r\ndesign appear not only in works of the same date, but in actual\r\ncombination, so that often it is not easy to draw any inference from\r\npoints of detail or even from broad characteristics of style. It is",
  "030.png": "objected with truth that the very divisions indicated by such\r\nphrases as \"Style Louis XV.\" or \"Style Louis XVI.\" are misleading.[1]\r\nConvenient terms, so long as we attach no strict chronological\r\nmeaning to their use; should we take them literally, they\r\nare a hindrance and a snare. The admirable \"Style R\u00e9gence\" for\r\nexample, owes much of its high quality to the fine constructive\r\nlines inherited from the preceding reign, whilst the \"Style Louis\r\nXVI.\" was really born in the reign of Louis XV., and found its\r\nmost perfect expression in the decoration and furnishing of Luciennes\r\nfor Mme. Dubarry. Work, moreover, may not infrequently\r\nbe found which--whether on account of individual taste or other\r\ncauses--presents all the characteristics of a date far earlier than that\r\nat which it was executed. If it were for this reason only the term\r\n\"style\"--when governed by the limitations above suggested--is\r\nto be preferred to the use in a similar sense of the term \"\u00e9poque,\"\r\nfor this assumes to fix not only the character of the work, but also\r\nthe date of its production.\r\n\r\nThe share of Queen Marie-Antoinette in the creation of the\r\n\"Style Louis XVI.,\" which ultimately developed into what is\r\npopularly known as the \"Style Empire,\" is a romantic fiction.\r\nShe found it in vogue when, yet a child, she arrived in France from\r\nVienna, and had nothing to do but to accept it, and--if we may\r\njudge from the fashion of some of the work undoubtedly executed\r\nfor her[2]--even the influence of the duc d'Aumont, by which her\r\nnative taste should have been purged of some of its commonness,\r\ndoes not seem to have been felt. In her service, as a matter of\r\ncourse, were achieved some of the greatest triumphs of the thin\r\nand poor, if excessively elegant style which embodied the triumph\r\nof the pseudo-classic reaction, and which was fated to suffer from\r\nthat inevitable paralysis of all life and spring of invention which\r\novertook the applied arts at the close of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen the Court to which they had looked for patronage and\r\nsupport had itself disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of social life as constituted by the Revolution had\r\n\r\n1 As M. Emile Molinier puts it: \"Toutes ces expressions sont, \u00e0 mon avis,\r\nvicieuses, car l'\u00e9tat artistique qu'elles sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 indiquer ne correspond\r\nnullement, pris dans son ensemble, aux trois p\u00e9riodes historiques sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es par ces\r\nd\u00e9nominations \u00e9troites.\" See \"Le Mobilier au XVII^e et au XVIII^e Si\u00e8cle,\" p. 95.\r\n\r\n2 Mr. Massey-Mainwaring has in his possession a sofa and four tabourets,\r\nmounted on wooden frames, dog-toothed and thickly gilt, every one of which bears\r\nthe well-known stamp, \"Garde-Meuble de la Reine.\" These are historically of great\r\nvalue, but are even more interesting as showing the kind of coarse design and execution\r\nwhich could be harboured along with the most elaborate triumphs of Riesener's\r\nskill and the pretty toys of Weisweiler.",
  "031.png": "neither the traditions nor the taste which could enable them to\r\nexercise control over those whom they employed. They accepted\r\nthe rule of the doctrinaire and the arch\u00e6ologist. I do not deny\r\nthat now and again, as when Prud'hon designed the cradle of the\r\nKing of Rome, beautiful things were shaped. His lovely drawing\r\nand the work itself--lent by the Emperor of Austria--were to\r\nbe seen in the Exposition de la Ville de Paris last summer.\r\nThe drawing was remarkable for the extraordinary minuteness\r\nof its details. It was plain that Prud'hon had had to do with\r\nmen who required considerably more than the rapid hints which\r\nseem to have sufficed for the brilliantly trained artificers of the\r\neighteenth century. It was also plain, I think, looking to the\r\nevident inferiority of the work as compared with the charm of\r\nPrud'hon's lovely drawing, that in the years which had been lost\r\nto the exercise of their craft, something had also been lost of that\r\nancient cunning which gave to the skilled workmen of Paris the\r\nsupreme rank in Europe.[1]\r\n\r\nThe extravagances of the \"Style Rocaille\" or \"rococo\" are\r\none of the most startling features of decorative art during the first\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century, but in the hands of Nicolas Pineau--and,\r\ngenerally speaking, always in the hands of Frenchmen--it\r\nachieved a determined symmetry by the ingenious balance of\r\nopposing curves, which gave no hint of the excesses into which it\r\nwas betrayed in Italy and Spain. Popular with a certain section\r\nof the world of Paris, and even more popular in its most\r\nexaggerated forms at foreign courts, it did not deeply affect the\r\ntaste of the great architects who controlled the decoration of the\r\nroyal palaces and sat at the council table of the Academy.\r\n\r\nRobert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand handed on the traditions\r\nwhich had been preserved by Mansart, and to the works\r\nof these two men--who built as many palaces abroad as they\r\nconstructed h\u00f4tels at home[2]--was due [** P2 to|P3 not necessarily] the development of the fine\r\nStyle R\u00e9gence and the Style Louis XV.

By its construction\r\nit belonged in fact to a previous era, having been left for a long\r\nwhile without thought of further ornament, till, in 1729, that\r\ndecoration was undertaken which made of it, as Piganiol de la\r\nForce has it, \"une des pi\u00e8ces les plus brillantes de ce superbe\r\nch\u00e2teau.\" In this Salon, which occupies the space previously\r\nfilled by the \"Tribunes de l'ancienne chapelle,\"[1] marble played,\r\nbut for the last time, a part as considerable as in the days of\r\nMansart himself. It is employed to achieve a general effect of\r\ngreen relieved with gold on a white background. The cornice,\r\nwhich is a marked feature, is heavily gilt and supported by green\r\nmarble pilasters of the composite order, the pedestals are of\r\nmarble, but the bases and capitals gilt.[2] The famous ceiling, by\r\nLe Moyne, is still in place, but we now miss the chief glories of\r\nthis great \"Salle\"--the two immense paintings by Paul Veronese,\r\nwhich formerly hung, one above the chimney-piece, the other on\r\nthe wall directly opposite. The first, the subject of which was\r\n\"The Meeting of Eliezer and Rebecca,\" is now at Fontainebleau,\r\nwhere it is attributed to \"L'Ecole de V\u00e9ron\u00e8se\"; but the other--which\r\nwas then described as \"Christ in the House of Simon the\r\nPharisee,\" an immense canvas which had been given to Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n1 The construction of the chapel was begun in March, 1699, and finished in\r\n1710. The decoration of the interior continued much later.

Cette bordure ... est incrust\u00e9e dans le\r\nmarbre, et est soutenue par quatre consoles aussi dor\u00e9es.\" The\r\npainting above the chimney-piece was, in the same way, brought\r\ninto relation with the other ornament of the \"Salle,\" the frame\r\nbeing let into the marble and supported by two \"Consoles dor\u00e9es\r\nd'or moulu, ainsi que les autres ornemens de cette chemin\u00e9e et\r\nceux des portes de ce Salon.\"[3]\r\n\r\nMost of these fine ornaments are still intact, and though their\r\ngeneral aspect and the balance of their lines bear witness to the\r\ncontinued influence of the school of Le Brun at its best, the actual\r\nforms are less bold and their relief less accentuated than in earlier\r\ndays. The frames of the pictures, in one of which the canvas of\r\nVeronese is now replaced by the \"Passage du Rhin,\" remind us\r\nof the splendid series of reliefs, executed by Vass\u00e9, to accompany\r\nthe paintings of Fran\u00e7ois Perier\"[4] in the \"Galerie dor\u00e9e\" of the\r\nH\u00f4tel de Toulouse.\r\n\r\nThis H\u00f4tel is not, however, to be recognized in its present\r\ncondition, as the building represented in the pages of Blondel's\r\n\"Architecture Fran\u00e7aise.\" Built in 1635,[5] on the plans of Fran-*\r\n\r\n1 See chap. iii., p. 43.\r\n\r\n2 1683-1736, Ag. 1723.

Piganiol attributes the execution of the whole framework to Vass\u00e9, but he is\r\nmisled probably by the fact that the gilt bronze decorations were all his work. M. de\r\nNolhac tells me that there are various entries in the \"Comptes\" of payments to\r\nVass\u00e9 for work in this Salon beginning with 1729 and ending in 1736. The most\r\ninteresting is the last: \"Parfait paiement de 9,230 l. \u00e0 quoy montait les ouvrages de\r\nbronze dor\u00e9 d'or moulu qu'il a fait, pour la chemin\u00e9e du Salon de marbre pr\u00e8s la\r\nChapelle de Versailles\" (O^1 2236).\r\n\r\n4 Fran\u00e7ois Perier or Perrier passed his youth in Rome. In 1630 he came to\r\nParis and attached himself to Vouet, but in 1638 went back to Rome, where he\r\nremained till 1645. He then returned to France, and not only executed the paintings\r\nof the H\u00f4tel de la Vrilli\u00e8re, but was also employed with Eustache Le Sueur at the\r\nH\u00f4tel Lambert de Thorigny.

They served, at least, as a diversion from the\r\nseries of annoyances and slights by which he was, in common with the\r\nother legitimized princes, gradually deprived of all the consequence\r\nwith which the senile affection of Louis XIV. had endowed them.\r\nThe \"comte de Toulouse, n'est plus rien,\" writes Mathieu Marais\r\non March 16th, 1723. \"Le conseil de marine a \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9.\r\nOn a \u00f4t\u00e9 au comte de Toulouse tout le d\u00e9tail qu'il avoit depuis la\r\nR\u00e9gence.\" Having been thus degraded, before the year was out,\r\nhe declared his secret marriage with Mme. de Gondrin, whose\r\nfirst husband had been the son of Mme. de Montespan's son, the\r\nDuke d'Antin, so that the Countess de Toulouse was wife both to\r\na son and a grandson.\r\n\r\nThe decorations of the Golden Gallery were probably carried\r\non under the eyes of this lady who had replaced the Duchess de\r\nChatillon in the affections of the Count de Toulouse, but the\r\nactual construction was certainly finished in 1719, and Piganiol\r\nadds: \"Tous ces changements out \u00e9t\u00e9 faits sous la conduite du\r\nsieur Robert de Cotte, premier architecte du Roi.\"\r\n\r\nDe Cotte had here a free hand, and he went considerably\r\nfarther in the path of innovation than he ventured to do at Versailles,\r\nwhere he was bound to a certain extent by his own\r\ntraditions. In the Golden Gallery, though it has not escaped\r\nreconstruction and restoration--in some parts intelligent, in others\r\nmuch the reverse--we still receive a clear impression of the stately\r\nbeauty of the original conception.\r\n\r\nThe ornament, seductively elegant in all its details, is marshalled\r\nwithin the strong lines of the architectural composition,\r\nand the alternating passages of flat tracery and low relief combine,\r\nwith the clear intention of carrying the eye towards those parts for\r\nwhich the honours of full relief are reserved.

The great novelty is, however, the introduction of the\r\nmirror over the chimney-piece which--as may be seen in our\r\nillustration--forms a striking feature of the general scheme.\r\n\r\nThis great sheet of glass,[1] which is crowned, as is the opposite\r\ndoorway, by a group of sculpture, reaches to the cornice and\r\nenhances the effect of size and light obtained by other mirrors\r\nthat alternate on the right, as do windows on the left, with the\r\npaintings[2] which fill the spaces intervening on either hand,\r\nbetween the Corinthian pilasters which support the arched ceiling.[3]\r\n\r\nNever was the talent of de Cotte more remarkable than in this\r\nmagnificent piece of decoration, in which he has maintained a\r\nharmony of ordered relations and a grandeur of proportion which\r\nyet leaves room for the display of a minute and exquisite elegance.\r\nThe moment that we enter the doors and face the splendid framework\r\nof the great mirror, we see that the statue may stand\r\nconspicuous, and mouldings of the boldest character challenge\r\ncomparison with the graceful play of delicate arabesques and\r\nlightly woven wreaths of flowers, yet nothing is lost, not even the\r\ntender play of sprays and tendrils which, in some passages, scarcely\r\nblossom above the surface of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe description given, in 1742, by the author of \"Les\r\nCuriositez de Paris,\" of a visit to this h\u00f4tel, presents so vivid and\r\ncomplete a picture of stately furnishing in the earlier half of the\r\ncentury that I am tempted to quote some portion of it at length.\r\n\"The grand staircase,\" we are told, \"is placed in the left wing,\r\nafter a doric vestibule, which at once conveys a great idea of what\r\n\r\n1 The original mirror was in several pieces.

Her son, the\r\nfuture King Louis-Philippe had left the country, and the H\u00f4tel\r\nde Penthi\u00e8vre was actually occupied by the \"Imprimeries du\r\nBulletin des Lois et de la R\u00e9publique.\" Not content, we are told,\r\nwith adding necessary buildings and making necessary alterations,\r\nthe two hundred workmen employed zealously effaced every\r\nemblem of the old order, and the Golden Gallery was spared only\r\nbecause it was found to be a convenient warehouse for paper.[1]\r\n\r\n1 See pp. 21-25, \"Notice sur l'\u00e9tat ancien et nouveau de la Galerie de l'H\u00f4tel de\r\nToulouse.\"",

In the \"Banque de France,\" which\r\nin 1808 replaced the \"Imprimerie Nationale\" within the walls of\r\nthe H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, the Golden Gallery found at last, when\r\nalmost too late, a generous guardian.\r\n\r\nThe story of its reconstruction, admirably and concisely told in\r\nthe \"Notice\" to which I have already referred, might profitably\r\nbe taken as an ensample by other public bodies. The generosity\r\nof the \"Banque,\" which having no use for the Gallery yet accepted\r\nthe costly task of its preservation, the unselfish devotion of the\r\narchitects and artists who co-operated in the work, illustrates a\r\nnoble conception of the duty of those to whom circumstances\r\nentrust the guardianship of a national treasure. Begun in 1858,\r\nsuspended by the disasters of 1870, the work was continued till its\r\ncompletion in 1875, without a break, and if the exterior no longer\r\nrepresents the work of Fran\u00e7ois Mansard, the decoration planned\r\nby Robert de Cotte for the interior has been most scrupulously\r\nrespected. One point alone seems to be open to criticism; the\r\nsculptor, M. Thomas, to whom was entrusted the execution of the\r\nfour statues representing the four quarters of the world, which\r\nhave replaced the lost originals, right and left of the doorway and\r\nthe chimney-piece, rejected the indications as to proportions and\r\ncharacter furnished by de Cotte,[1] and these figures have now an\r\nincongruous air from which the finely designed work of the fire-*place,\r\nby MM. Cruchet and Gilbert, is entirely free.\r\n\r\nThe most notable portion of the whole decoration, the brilliant\r\nsculptures of Antoine Vass\u00e9, were, fortunately, found to be in\r\nan excellent condition, and their reparation--which consisted\r\nsimply in the mending of places where the wood had scaled off--was\r\nonly a work of time and patience. We have therefore before\r\nus the actual work of his hands, and can estimate his genuine gifts\r\nas a decorator. As a sculptor, Vass\u00e9 had small reputation with his\r\ncontemporaries. \"Il ne vit jamais l'Italie,\" says Mariette, \"et ses\r\nouvrages le disent assez. On n'y voit que de la gentillesse, et rien\r\nde ce go\u00fbt solide et m\u00e2le qui doit \u00eatre le veritable caract\u00e8re de la\r\nsculpture, et que donne seule l'\u00e9tude du bel antique.\" Vass\u00e9 was,\r\nas Mariette insists, a decorator; in decoration he won his chief\r\ndistinction, and above all his other work in this class, whether at\r\nNeuilly, Versailles or elsewhere, the decorations, of every kind,\r\n\r\n1 Reproduced by Destailleurs, \"Recueil d'Estampes relatives \u00e0 l'ornementation\r\ndes appartements,\" t. i., pl. 61 and 62.

The\r\nmore delicate portions and most certainly the modelling of the\r\ngroups in relief, on a dead gold ground, which figure at the base\r\nof each panel, must have lost greatly in value from the coating of\r\ngold laid upon them. Mariette has, indeed, in this connection a\r\nsignificant passage in which after writing almost with enthusiasm\r\nof Vass\u00e9's wood-carvings in this gallery, he adds \"la dorure dont\r\non les a couverts les a gat\u00e9s,\" and the repeated applications from\r\nwhich they have again suffered, in the course of the work of\r\nrestoration, though, perhaps, necessary for their preservation, are\r\non other accounts much to be regretted. Overwhelmed by so\r\nmuch lavish magnificence, the visitor to the Galerie dor\u00e9e is\r\ninclined to echo M. de Champeaux's words and to say, \"on ne\r\nsaurait lui reprocher que de trop m\u00e9riter son nom!\"[1]\r\n\r\nWorks of decoration, on a great scale, such as these, suggest\r\na question as to what were the respective shares of the architect\r\nand of those whom he employed on them. De Cotte, it is\r\ncertain, cannot even have superintended much that he had in his\r\ncharge. He had far too many responsibilities to be able to look\r\nclosely after small things, though, as a rule, it is certain that the\r\narchitect gave not only general indications but also kept close\r\nwatch over those to whom he entrusted the execution of his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nAll the decorations which were carried out under the direction\r\nof Germain Boffrand have undoubtedly strong personal character,\r\nin which we recognize both the \"go\u00fbt de d\u00e9coration assez masle,\"\r\nwith which his contemporaries credited him, and an instinctive\r\nelegance which is equally original. There must have been constant\r\nand minute supervision on his part, or his assistants were\r\nartists so perfectly trained that they understood and followed the\r\nslightest promptings of his genius. He had, we are told, \"un\r\ngo\u00fbt singulier pour le th\u00e9\u00e2tre qui lui a fait produire plusieurs\r\npi\u00e8ces, dont quelques-unes sont estim\u00e9es.\"[2] I have never had the\r\nluck to come across any of these plays, but in the mere fact of\r\ntheir production there is a suggestion of that exquisite sense of\r\nthe value of general effect which distinguishes his treatment of\r\nthe interior, and is not foreign to the skill which he displayed\r\n\"dans la partie de la distribution des pi\u00e8ces qui entrent dans la\r\ncomposition des b\u00e2timents.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe Chancellerie of the Dukes of Orleans, still standing in the\r\n\r\n1 \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans le vieux Paris,\" p. 235.\r\n\r\n2 Mariette, A B C Dario.\r\n\r\n3 Ibid.",

It suffered from restoration\r\nalso a second time, when, during the present century, M. Sandoz\r\nestablished his \"Magasin de bronzes\" in the rooms which had\r\nwitnessed the scandalous life of the brilliant Cardinal and the idle\r\nphilosophy of his successor, the Count d'Argenson.\r\n\r\nThe visitor who will find his way to the Chancellerie d'Orl\u00e9ans\r\nmay easily convince himself that--as in the Galerie dor\u00e9e--repeated\r\nregilding has injured the delicate ornaments of the panels\r\nand the framework of the doors and mirrors, which are composed\r\nof shells, arabesques, and diaper patterns, carved with great elegance\r\nand precision. Originally, too, I think that the decoration of the\r\n\"Grand Salon,\" as well as that of the \"Grand Cabinet\" which\r\nopens into it, must have been a little heavy. It seems as if Boffrand\r\nhad not then freed himself from the influence of Mansart, for the\r\nforce of some passages reminds us rather of de Cotte, than of that\r\nelegance which is specially proper to the design of Boffrand, as we\r\nknow it in later work. In the \"Salle \u00e0 Manger,\" on the other hand,\r\nwe find delicate gold arabesques on a white ground, curving along\r\nthe concave border of the ceiling, which enframes \"H\u00e9b\u00e9 versant\r\nle nectar,\" a work of Lagren\u00e9e le jeune, and showing a grace and\r\nstyle akin to the finest work in the H\u00f4tel de Soubise. This room\r\nhas in fact suffered least of all; it retains the pilasters, which have\r\ndisappeared from the Grand Salon; its chimney-piece still boasts\r\nthe bronzes with which it was originally incrusted, and the\r\nsculptured cornice seems to have been left untouched. In other\r\nrooms are many traces of more modern work.

One asks in vain what has become of\r\nthe numerous \"embellissements\" which the H\u00f4tel de Broglio, as\r\nd'Argenville calls it, received at Boffrand's hands in 1711,[3] or\r\nwhere may be the decorations of the great H\u00f4tel which he erected\r\nfor the Marquis de Torcy, and which, after having been the\r\nresidence of Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, is now occupied by the\r\nGerman Embassy.[4] The tyranny of fashion which stripped the\r\nH\u00f4tel Torcy of all its magnificent interior decorations and replaced\r\nthem by the pseudo-classic work which, for the moment, represented\r\nthe \"correct taste,\" has played a like part in the destruction\r\nof the majority of the houses whose walls once bore eloquent witness\r\nto Boffrand's surpassing taste and skill. Traces of the elegance\r\nwhich was a special mark of his genius may still be found in\r\nparts of the Petit Luxembourg, which was rapidly built by him\r\nfor Anne of Bavaria, the widow of the Prince de Cond\u00e9.[5] If,\r\nhowever, we want to see his work on walls, for which it was\r\noriginally designed, we have but the Chancellerie d'Orl\u00e9ans, the\r\n\"Salle des Manuscrits\" at the Arsenal, and, lastly, the crowning\r\ntriumph which he achieved in the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, where are\r\nnow housed the Archives Nationales.\r\n\r\nOf the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, a contemporary writer says: \"Cet\r\nh\u00f4tel est pr\u00e9sentement occup\u00e9 par le Prince de Rohan-Soubize,\r\n\r\n1 De Champeaux, \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans le vieux Paris,\" p. 268.

Great sums\r\nhad, however, been lavished from the first on the interior of these\r\nmagnificent buildings. In 1702, a series of important works--portraits\r\nof personages and princes of the house of Rohan--were\r\nordered of a painter named Blanchard,[1] and the decorations of the\r\nprivate apartments, designed by Herpin, or Harpin, were no doubt\r\nanterior to those undertaken by Boffrand.\r\n\r\n\"Le S^r Harpin\"--for so he signs his \"D\u00e9coration de l'int\u00e9rieur\r\nd'un Sallon destin\u00e9 pour l'est\u00e9,\" and other designs engraved\r\nby Mariette which were executed on the ground floor of the\r\nH\u00f4tel de Soubise--is supposed by some to be identical with Louis\r\nHerpin, a certain \"peintre-entrepreneur,\" who worked at Toulon\r\nin 1684.[2] M. de Champeaux suggests that, at Toulon, Harpin\r\n\"\u00e9tait appel\u00e9 Herpin,\" and,--in extenuation of the fact that the\r\nauthor of the decorations of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, describes himself\r\non the plates published by Mariette as \"Sculpteur du roi\"--he\r\nadds that he was better known as a painter than as a sculptor,\r\nand had probably accompanied his compatriots, Toro and Antoine\r\nVass\u00e9, to Paris.[3] This may be. The \"peintre-entrepreneur\" may\r\nhave also been a sculptor and a \"sculpteur du roi,\" but I have\r\nmy doubts, for I find that there was a certain Jacques Herpin, or\r\nHarpin--for his name is spelt by d'Argenville in both ways--who\r\nwas a \"sculpteur du roi,\" and was born in Paris. His name appears\r\nfor the first time in the \"Comptes des B\u00e2timents,\" in 1698, when\r\nhe was working at the Invalides on the \"grande corniche et architrave,\r\nroses et modillons du pourtour de l'\u00e9glise:\"[4] it seems therefore\r\nprobable that he is the same Herpin, or Harpin, who executed\r\nat Versailles various vases decorated with \"fleur de lys,\" or \"orn\u00e9s\r\n\r\net augment\u00e9e tous les jours de manuscrits et de livres des plus rares et des plus\r\ncurieux.\" Ibid., p. 279, and ed. 1716, p. 109.

See A. de l'A. fr., t. ii., p. 145.\r\nThese works are identified with those mentioned by d'Argenville (Voy. Paris, p. 253)\r\nin his description of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise: \"Au premier \u00e9tage, l'antichambre qui\r\npr\u00e9cede[** pr\u00e9c\u00e8de] la chapelle est d\u00e9cor\u00e9e dans son pourtour de douze portraits en pied de la\r\nMaison de Soubize, dont Joseph Parrocel a peint plusieurs fonds.\"\r\n\r\n2 A. de l'A. fr., t. vi., pp. 165, 175.\r\n\r\n3 \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans le vieux Paris,\" p. 184.\r\n\r\n4 The entry runs as follows: \"1698 21 Sept^{re} 14 D\u00e9c^{re}: \u00e0 Herpin, Masson, Balan,\r\nDupr\u00e9, Robert, Fran\u00e7ois, Lange et le Maire le fils sur la sculpture de la grande\r\ncorniche ... 800 lt.\" In the following year, 1699, is a similar entry, \"4 Jan^r-1^r\r\nmars,\" in which the names of the sculptors are given more fully. \"Comptes des\r\nb\u00e2timents sous le R\u00e8gne de Louis XIV., 1696-1705,\" t. iv.",
  "049.png": "de fleurs champ\u00eatres,\"[1] and, considering the date, it is more than\r\npossible, that the sculptor of the Invalides is no other than the\r\nSieur Harpin of the H\u00f4tel du Soubise.\r\n\r\nNone of the decorations executed by Harpin on the ground\r\nfloor of this famous h\u00f4tel have come down to us, but anyone may\r\nbe convinced by looking at the designs engraved by Mariette, from\r\nwhich two very characteristic examples have been reproduced in\r\nM. Destailleur's valuable \"Recueil,\" that Harpin was not an\r\noriginal talent. For the \"Salon d'\u00e9t\u00e9,\" he gives us a well-conceived\r\nscheme reminiscent of the balance and emphasis of Mansart and de\r\nCotte; for the \"Grand cabinet des livres,\" he has--in his use of the\r\nfamiliar palm branch garlanded by little flowers--as evidently\r\nsought inspiration from Nicolas Pineau.\r\n\r\nIn neither instance do we find a trace of the distinction peculiar\r\nto the work of Germain Boffrand who represents, I think, with unrivalled\r\nbrilliance the tendencies which affected decoration in the\r\nearlier half of the eighteenth century. A certain heaviness clings\r\nto everything handled by de Cotte, and is evident even in the\r\nmarvels of the Golden Gallery; but the most careless sightseer\r\nwho wanders through the rooms of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, cannot\r\nfail to be struck by the delicacy and lightness of the ornament, nor\r\nto recognise the extraordinary simplicity of line by which an impression\r\nof equal grandeur and magnificence is conveyed. Over\r\nand above all we are struck by a personal accent which, if we have\r\nonce observed it, becomes for us the sign by which we detect the\r\npresence of Boffrand's master-hand. It is difficult to say in what\r\nthis special character consists. Differences of style often depend on\r\nminute adjustments of balance in ornament, the precise value of\r\nwhich can scarcely be put into words, yet which are more important\r\nthan those points of detail which are sometimes treated as\r\nessential. The choice of details in itself is rarely important, but\r\nthe way in which they are employed may be in the highest degree\r\nsignificant. In the \"Grand Salon\" at the Arsenal, Boffrand employs\r\nfor the framework of his mirrors the same \"tiges de palmiers\r\nentour\u00e9es de guirlandes de fleurs\" as are sketched by Harpin in his\r\n\"Grand Cabinet pour livres.\" At first sight the details of these\r\ntwo designs seem identical, but a closer examination shows that\r\nBoffrand has declined to follow Harpin in his attempt to maintain\r\nbalance by irregularity and has relied, as is, I think, his invariable\r\npractice, on perfectly symmetrical design.\r\n\r\nThis absolute symmetry and quiet are, at least, marked features\r\n\r\n1 See Pig. de la F., \"Desc. de Versailles,\" t. ii., pp. 58, 60, 79, and d'Arg.,\r\n\"Env. Paris,\" pp. 101 and 127.",
  "050.png": "of the splendid decorations of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise which, together\r\nwith the Salon at the Arsenal, now represent for us the most brilliant\r\nexamples of Boffrand's genius. To himself, also, the work at the\r\nH\u00f4tel de Soubise seems to have been of extraordinary importance,\r\nand that, too, when a score of other great decorations,[1] some of\r\nwhich were of equal extent, were still in place. The greater part\r\nof these have unfortunately disappeared, and neither the H\u00f4tel de\r\nSoubise nor the Arsenal have wholly escaped treatment by which\r\ntheir original scheme has been more or less maimed.\r\n\r\nThe state apartments of the prince, which occupied the\r\nground-floor of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, have greatly suffered and--if\r\none may judge by the staircase which has replaced the original\r\nfine construction--quite needlessly, for this wanton act was not a\r\nconsequence of the adaptation of the premises to their present purpose.\r\nThe Salon Ovale still retains the sculptured groups and\r\nvigorous ornament of Lambert-Sigisbert Adam and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\r\nLemoyne,[2] but the \"chambre \u00e0 coucher\" by which it is preceded\r\nis cut in half by a partition, and has been stripped of the magnificent\r\nwainscot of which only four panels, together with the fluted\r\ncolumns which supported the alcove, are now in existence.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor, although the vast \"Salle d'Assembl\u00e9e\"--where\r\nRestout had decorated \"le dessus des portes de la Dispute\r\nde Ph\u0153bus et de Bor\u00e9e, et de celle de Neptune avec Pallas\"--retains\r\nscarcely a vestige of its former state, we still find in the\r\napartments of the princess a type of the decorative art of the\r\nearlier half of the eighteenth century in its most brilliant and\r\nwholly admirable perfection, and for this portion of the h\u00f4tel it is\r\ninteresting to find that d'Argenville, who writes in 1757, may\r\nwith some correction even now be our guide. \"Dans la Chambre\r\n\u00e0 coucher,\" he says, \"sont deux dessus de porte, de M. Boucher.\r\nSuit une autre Chambre, o\u00f9 Tr\u00e9molli\u00e8re a peint les Graces qui\r\npr\u00e9sident \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation de l'Amour, et Minerve qui enseigne \u00e0 une\r\nNymphe \u00e0 faire de la tapisserie.

The action of the Loves who gesticulate with\r\nanimation at the base of each frame has wonderful energy and is\r\nof great value in giving support to the splendid reliefs and other\r\nfigures of the cornice.\r\n\r\n1 D'Arg., \"Voy.

  "054.png": "\r\nTo me, though, the triumph of Boffrand's marvellous art and\r\nthe keynote of his skill as a decorator is to be found in the daring\r\nwith which he contrives clear places of peace for the eye. In the\r\nmidst of all this superb wealth of colour, enhanced by lavish\r\ndisplay of gilding and enframed in equally magnificent sculptural\r\ndecoration, he has dared to leave great spaces quiet. The field of\r\nthe inter-panels, bordered by a finely sculptured design, delicate as\r\ntracery work, yet of noble style, is left virgin of all ornament.\r\nThis same scheme is pursued in the corresponding Salon of the\r\nprince's apartments, in which the decoration is wholly sculptural,\r\nand it is from this frankly conceived opposition of empty spaces to\r\na multiple variety of brilliant colour and relief, marshalled by the\r\nmasterly disposition of extremely simple lines, that Boffrand conveys\r\nthe impression of striking grandeur.\r\n\r\nAnd, to this one thing especially Boffrand's work--with its\r\nhigh qualities of invention and resource, its delicacy of detail, and\r\nits profusion of costly art--owes its supreme distinction. The\r\nplain surface, in his hands, acquires significance and value from the\r\ncomplicated elaboration of its setting. This is where, for the\r\nmost part, our decorators fail, for the empty space appears to\r\nthem but as a symbol and proof of poverty, and the wall is therefore\r\ncrowded with ornament until the architectural intention--if\r\nthere ever were any--is obscured and lost.\r\n\r\nFor delicacy and elegance of detail, the decoration of the Salon\r\nOvale seems to me unsurpassed by any work of the same class, not\r\nexcepting even the original and beautiful cornice of the \"Chambre\r\n\u00e0 coucher,\" in which groups of mythological divinities, admirably\r\nhandled by Nicolas-Sebastian Adam,[1] crown trophies, the frames\r\nof which are wrought into the graceful arabesques by which their\r\nmovement is continued. In this room--which still retains the\r\nornament of its mirrors and doors together with the four great\r\npanels bearing on their centre sculptured medallions representing\r\nthe amorous adventures of Jupiter--we find the balustrade which\r\nmarks the position of the ruelle and reminds us that Boffrand had\r\ndesigned the very hangings which were woven at Lyons for the\r\nalcove.[2] Even in their empty desolation there is a splendour of\r\nachievement about these walls so superb that our admiration suffers\r\nno defeat, we forget the present sordid conditions of occupation and\r\nsee only, as in a vision, that stately life which has been so magnificently\r\nstaged by one of the greatest decorators the world has\r\never seen. We call to mind, too, that \"go\u00fbt singulier pour le\r\n\r\n1 In. g\u00e9n. Mon. civ. Paris, t. i., p. 35.\r\n\r\n2 De Champeaux, \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif,\" p. 180.",

The pictures executed by Oudry in 1742[1]\r\nfor the dining-room have been sold, and sold, too, all the sculptured\r\nwainscot which once adorned its walls.[2] They have not, however,\r\nquitted Paris.

Edmond de Rothschild, my attention wandered from\r\n\"La Recrue allant joindre le r\u00e9giment,\" an early work by Watteau,\r\nwhich was on the table before me, to the panelling and cornice of\r\nthe room in which I seemed to see the unmistakable signature of\r\nGermain Boffrand. The answer to my enquiries was, \"ces boiseries\r\nsont effectivement de Boffrand, elles proviennent d'un petit h\u00f4tel\r\nqui se trouvait dans la rue des Archives. Quant \u00e0 la corniche qui\r\nse trouve dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce, elle vient en effet de l'h\u00f4tel de\r\nSamuel Bernard, c'est la corniche originale que j'ai fait transporter\r\net adapter \u00e0 ce Salon.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the \"Chancellerie d'Orl\u00e9ans\" it would\r\nseem that all the most characteristic work by Boffrand--all the\r\nwork which gives him his position as the representative of the\r\ngreat moment in which the lightest fancies of the new school\r\ngracefully accepted the control of all that was most noble in the\r\nStyle Louis XIV.--was executed in his later years. We know\r\nthe date at which the hotel of Jacques-Samuel Bernard was in\r\nbuilding from that of the great canvases executed by Oudry for\r\nhis dining-room; we know that although the paintings for the\r\nSalon Ovale were all in place before 1740, yet Boffrand was still\r\noccupied at the H\u00f4tel de Soubise in 1745, and in that year he\r\nwas also working at the Arsenal, where the Duke de Maine many\r\nyears before had begun the great Salon, the completion of which\r\nwas, however, long delayed.[3]\r\n\r\n1 See \"Salons\" of Oudry, Appendix B.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., pp. 104, 105.\r\n\r\n3 The principal front was rebuilt by Boffrand in 1718. The interior alterations\r\nundertaken by the duke were considerable. In 1742 the author of \"Les Curiositez*",
  "056.png": "\r\nThe decoration of this beautiful room is wholly sculptural,\r\nand its date, without the help of other indications, may be fixed\r\napproximately by that of the low reliefs of the Seasons, which\r\ntake the place of paintings above the four doors. These reliefs\r\nare repetitions of those which were executed by Bouchardon in\r\n1741[1] for the Fountain of the rue de Grenelle, and the choice of\r\nthese charming subjects as a prominent feature in the decoration\r\nof the Salon is in some sort evidence of the open mind which the\r\ngreat architect-decorator preserved to the last. He was, at this\r\ndate, over seventy, an age at which men's eyes are often dead\r\nto new impressions; yet he was able instantly to welcome the\r\npromise shown by Bouchardon, just as a few years later he bravely\r\nincurred the anger of Paul-Ambroise Slodtz by his efforts to\r\nobtain a share in the work at St. Merry (\"quelques bas-reliefs,\"\r\nsays Cochin,[2]) for Pigalle, then comparatively unknown and\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nThe trophies on the panels above the mirrors are the next\r\nmost important feature of the decoration, and the fact that these\r\ntrophies are composed of musical instruments has led to the\r\nconjecture that the room was originally the Salon de Musique\r\nof the Duchess. Unfortunately, the first thing that one now\r\nnotices on entering is that this room has been the victim of a\r\nmodern \"arrangement,\" and the double interpanels either side\r\nof the great blank in the centre of the wall facing the windows,\r\nlook absurdly inexplicable, till one learns that the Mus\u00e9e des Arts\r\nd\u00e9coratifs is in possession of doors which have been wantonly\r\nsuppressed. If, as I suppose, these doors formerly occupied the space\r\nnow filled up by a neat boarding, to which the clock decorated by\r\n\"une d\u00e9pouille de lion\" is attached, one can only infer that we are\r\nagain face to face with another of those acts of coolly calculated\r\n\r\nde Paris\" says: \"L'Arsenal est ... compos\u00e9 de beaucoup d'appartemens occup\u00e9s\r\npar le feu duc du Maine, grand Ma\u00eetre de l'Artillerie de France, qui en a faict jetter\r\nbas quelques-uns pour les reb\u00e2tir; les dedans en sont tr\u00e8s-magnifiques et richement\r\nmeubl\u00e9s\" (t. i., p. 350).\r\n\r\n1 The \"Four Seasons,\" by Bouchardon, were exhibited at the Salon of 1741.\r\nSee note, p. 73, \"French Architects and Sculptors of the Eighteenth Century.\"\r\nThe decoration of a room in the ch\u00e2teau de Morangis (Seine et Oise), of which I\r\nhave a photograph, shows an arrangement evidently inspired by the Salon at the\r\nArsenal. The reliefs of the \"Four Seasons\" over the doors are not those designed\r\nby Bouchardon, and the whole composition belongs to a much later date--possibly\r\nthirty years later--but the general intention is the same.\r\n\r\n2 M\u00e9m. in\u00e9d. de Charles-Nicolas Cochin, p. 131. This statement gives colour\r\nto the supposition that Boffrand, and not Richard, was the architect of the Chapelle\r\nde la Communion in this church. It is attributed to him by d'Argenville, but that\r\nattribution is contested. See d'Arg., \"Voy. Paris,\" p. 218; In. g\u00e9n. Ed. rel. Paris,\r\nt. i., p. 284; and Bauchal, \"Nouv.

  "059.png": "vandalism, by which architects, to whom the care of public\r\nbuildings is entrusted, are prone to distinguish themselves. One\r\nremembers that an architect bearing the ominous name of\r\nLabrouste, was attached in that capacity to the Biblioth\u00e8que de\r\nl'Arsenal in 1841, and that \"il y fit des travaux\" during 1859\r\nand 1860.[1]\r\n\r\nIn some respects though this room--which is now the Salle\r\ndes Manuscrits--has suffered little, and it is still possible to stand\r\nwhere only the beautiful proportions, the fine lines, and the\r\nelegance of the decoration are obvious, and surely never were the\r\nnice relations of panels to interpanels, of simple mouldings and\r\nelaborate design more happily conceived, nor were any mirrors\r\never framed with a more graceful touch. Boffrand, in the preservation\r\nof this room, which is one of his most seductive, as it is one\r\nof his last works, has been far more fortunate than his great rival\r\nde Cotte. The Golden Gallery is, indeed, still preserved for us\r\nby the wealth and generosity of the Banque de France, but where\r\nare the famous decorations designed by that distinguished architect\r\nfor the Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi?\r\n\r\nAgain we call to mind that fatal name and the reign of that\r\nHenri-Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Labrouste,[2] who for twenty years (1855-1875)\r\nwrought ruin in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. Inspired\r\nby a veritable rage of destruction, he cast the superb \"rampe\r\nd'escalier,\" now at Hertford House, into the street, and the\r\n\"boiseries\" of de Cotte shared the same fate. They were literally\r\nsold as rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Hertford did not care for carven panels but\r\nhe saved the \"rampe\"; another amateur, whose untimely death\r\nmust always be regretted by those who love letters and art, M.\r\nJames de Rothschild, rescued the work of de Cotte from the\r\ngutter. \"Il se rendit acqu\u00e9reur,\" writes M. Emile Picot, \"des\r\nadmirables boiseries ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es pour la biblioth\u00e8que du roi sur les\r\ndessins de Robert de Cotte, lorsque M. Labrouste, les jugeant sans\r\ndoute indignes de figurer dans un \u00e9difice construit sur ses plans, les\r\nfit vendre avec les mat\u00e9riaux de rebut.\"[3]\r\n\r\n1 Theodore Labrouste, 1799-1885.\r\n\r\n2 Henri-Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Labrouste, 1801-1875.

The return to\r\nwhat he called good taste coincided, in his opinion, with the\r\narrival in Paris of Legeay,[6] that \"grand prix d'architecture,\" who,\r\nin 1754, was called away to Berlin. Legeay is, however, less\r\nknown to us now by his works at Potsdam than by the story of\r\nhis audacious conduct to the king over the plans of Sans Souci,\r\nfor he not only derided Frederick's proposal that the entrance\r\nshould be by a window, but actually put his hand to his sword\r\nwhen the king, irritated by his impudence, threatened to strike\r\nhim with his cane.[7]\r\n\r\nAll that Cochin says of these men in his curious \"Memoirs,\"\r\n\r\n1 Cochin, M\u00e9m. in\u00e9d., p. 140.\r\n\r\n2 Nicolas Pineau, 1684-1754.\r\n\r\n3 Gilles-Marie Oppenord, 1672-1742.

  "061.png": "whether in praise or blame, points to the immense importance\r\nthen attached to what are dismissed by some as mere questions\r\nof ornament, and treated as if they had no connection with\r\nprinciples of construction. To design ornament was then held\r\nto be the special province of the architect, and Cochin brands\r\nwith opprobrium the unfortunate La Joue, because he, who was\r\nbut a second-rate painter of \"architecture,\" had the presumption\r\nto find eager purchasers for his ornamental designs.[1]\r\n\r\nNicolas Pineau himself is dismissed by Mariette with the\r\ncurt notice, \"sculpteur en bois,\"[2] but he certainly had other\r\nclaims to consideration. He was, says family tradition, a pupil\r\nof Mansart, and also spent some time with \"M. Germain de\r\nBoffrand.\" M. Emile Biais--to whose volume \"Les Pineau\"\r\nwe are indebted for much valuable material--tells us on the same\r\nauthority that Pineau attended the \"cours de sculpture\" of the\r\nAcademy of St. Luke; that he was guided by the criticisms of\r\nCoysevox as to the figure, and frequented the workshop of the\r\nfamous Thomas Germain, \"orf\u00e9vre du Roy.\"[3]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the family papers give no hint as to when or\r\nwhere Nicolas Pineau worked under Boffrand. M. de Champeaux\r\nsays: \"Il est cependant pr\u00e9sumable que la majeure partie des\r\nboiseries de l'h\u00f4tel de Soubise avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sculpt\u00e9es par Nicolas\r\nPineau,\"[4] but, as far as I can see, this appears to be very unlikely.\r\nIt is, of course, possible that in early days Pineau was\r\nglad to take employment of a subordinate character, and carry\r\nout, under the direction of a superior, designs of a type wholly\r\nopposite to that which inspired his own powers. We must\r\nremember, however, that the decoration of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise\r\nis not supposed to have been carried forward actively by Boffrand\r\ntill after the date at which Pineau left Paris for Russia with the\r\narchitect, Alexandre Leblond. The cong\u00e9 was granted to Le\r\nBlond, and \"\u00e0 sa compagnie pour aller pr\u00e8s de sa majest\u00e9\r\nCzarienne\" on April 15th, 1716, but there was some delay\r\nbefore all those engaged were ready to start. Le Blond himself\r\nis always said to have made his departure in the following year.\r\nHe went by land, and it is possible that those who went by sea,\r\n\"et qui doivent se joindre \u00e0 Charleville\"--amongst whom were\r\nPineau, his wife Marianne Simon, her sister Marguerite Simon,\r\nand their mother Marie-Marguerite Simon--had to start somewhat\r\nearlier.[5]\r\n\r\n1 M\u00e9m. in\u00e9d., p. 140.\r\n\r\n2 A B C Dario, Mariette.\r\n\r\n3 Emile Biais, \"Les Pineau,\" p. 16.\r\n\r\n4 \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif,\" etc., p. 184.\r\n\r\n5 \"Le Cabinet historique de Juillet, 1856 (p. 188 et suiv.) a publi\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s un",

When Leblond\r\nleft Paris in 1717 he took with him as many as thirty skilled\r\nworkmen, even the jealously guarded Gobelins yielded a contingent\r\nof \"haute et basse-lissiers.\" High up on the long list--on\r\nwhich \"Antoine C\u0153ur d'acier dit Lassurance, tailleur de\r\npierre,\" occupies an honourable place--stands \"Nicolas Pinau,\r\nsculpteur,\" and to him fell the task of carrying out the splendid\r\nprojects of Leblond, who died of small pox two years after his\r\narrival in Russia.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe authority of Blondel is claimed for the curious volumes\r\nentitled \"Les Amours rivaux ou l'homme du monde \u00e9clair\u00e9 par\r\nles arts,\"[2] in which we find the statement that Pineau was carried\r\nto \"Moscow\" by Peter the Great, and remained there for five and\r\ntwenty years. Moscow is probably loosely used for Moscovy, but\r\na quarter of a century is far too liberal an allowance for Pineau's\r\nstay in Russia, which really lasted only about ten years.\" \"De\r\nretour \u00e0 Paris, avec sa famille,\" continues the same writer, \"il\r\ncr\u00fbt pouvoir y exercer l'architecture, comme il avait fait en Russie,\r\napr\u00e8s la mort de Le Blond[**P2 prev.

Ce fut lui qui imagina le contraste dans les ornements.\"[3]\r\nIt is clear from this passage that Pineau cannot be\r\nranked as an ordinary wood-carver and designer of ornament for\r\nthe interior, and that his pretensions as an architect, if they could\r\nnot secure the sanction of the Academy, had a very serious and\r\npractical basis.\r\n\r\nOne can only guess at the reasons which induced Pineau to\r\nleave France for Russia, and I conjecture that his situation in\r\nParis was not brilliant in the early years of the century. He had\r\nlost his father when a lad of twelve. On this point the evidence\r\nof the Comptes des b\u00e2timents is conclusive, and M.

It begins with \"sculpture\"\r\nat the \"Surintendance\" at Versailles, and ends, in his last years,\r\nwith the execution of all the boiseries of the Trianon.[4] Like\r\nhis comrades Caffieri and Herpin, he wrought both wood and\r\nstone, and the vases, which excited the admiration of Piganiol de\r\nla Force at the entrance to the Orangerie of Versailles, and which\r\nhe says are by the sculptor \"Pinot,\"[5] are the \"vingt quatre vazes\r\nde pierre de Trossi,\" for which Baptiste received 2,030 lt. as\r\n\"parfait payement\" in January, 1687.[6]\r\n\r\nI am dwelling on these points, because they show that the\r\n\r\n1 \"Les Pineau,\" p. 13.\r\n\r\n2 \"Comptes des b\u00e2timents du roi sous le r\u00e8gne de Louis XIV.,\" t. iii., pp. 1090,\r\n1137.\r\n\r\n3 \"Les Pineau,\" p. 18.\r\n\r\n4 \"Comptes des b\u00e2timents du roi sous le r\u00e8gne de Louis XIV.,\" t. ii., pp. 21, 164,\r\n178, 185, 196, 301, 303, 412, 440, 654, 803, 1115, and t. iii., pp. 100, 288, 525.\r\n\r\n5 \"Desc. de Versailles,\" t. ii., pp. 98, 348.

  "068.png": "\r\nThe \"dragons,\" which are a noticeable feature of this decoration,\r\nhave probably induced M. de Champeaux to attribute the\r\nexecution of this work to the \"ornemaniste N. Pineau.\" This\r\nattribution is supported by the fact that a sketch \"pour un dessus\r\nde porte,\" beneath which is written \"pour le Palais Royal,\"[1] is still\r\nin the possession of his descendants, and it enables us to fix, approximately,\r\non the work by which Nicolas Pineau was first\r\noccupied on his return to France from Russia. His eldest son,\r\nDominique, \"sculpteur dans son genre mais ... moins hardi\r\ndans ses compositions\"[2] explains this return as consequent on the\r\ndeath of Peter the Great, which cut short in 1725 the various\r\nprojects the execution of which had been entrusted to Nicolas\r\nPineau after the death of Le Blond. Most of these were never\r\ncompleted. \"Nous avons vu,\" writes d'Argenville, \"le Czar\r\nPierre I. attirer \u00e0 sa Cour un Architecte Fran\u00e7ois, pour pr\u00e9sider\r\naux dessins de ses maisons de plaisance, qui n'ont cependant jamais\r\neu leur pleine ex\u00e9cution et sont pr\u00e9sentement ruin\u00e9es.\"[3] They\r\nhad, however, been carried far enough to create for Pineau a reputation\r\nwhich preceded him to Paris and ensured him a considerable\r\nposition, the importance of which was heightened by that of the\r\nfortune which he had amassed during his stay in Russia. His\r\npossession of wealth and of costly imperial gifts, furs and diamonds,[4]\r\nwas all the more conspicuous at a time when almost every artist in\r\nParis had been ruined by the \"system.\"\r\n\r\nNicolas Pineau, say his descendants, on his arrival took a house\r\nin \"la Rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth\"[5] in the Quartier du Marais.\r\nThis was close to the establishment of the P\u00e8res de Nazareth, for\r\nwhom he carried out not only the decoration of their Lady chapel,\r\nwhich was \"orn\u00e9e d'Architecture, et de plusieurs grouppes\r\nd'anges qui soutiennent ses attributs,\" but also carved a magnificent\r\nframe for the \"Annunciation\" of Le Brun, which had been given\r\nto the Fathers by their patron and founder, Chancellor S\u00e9guier.[6]\r\nThere is, unfortunately, no date to which we can refer the execution\r\nof these works, and indeed the entry, on the family register,\r\nof \"H\u00f4tel de Conti \u00e0 Paris, 1733,\"[7] gives us the earliest that can\r\nbe found amongst the papers which the family have preserved, but\r\n\r\n1 \"Les Pineau,\" p. 164.\r\n\r\n2 \"Les Amours rivaux,\" etc. etc., t. ii., p. 292.\r\n\r\n3 D'Arg., \"Env.

In September, 1722, Mathieu Marais writes: \"Le Comte\r\nd'Evreux, homme singulier, a fait b\u00e2tir une maison magnifique au\r\nfaubourg de Saint-Honor\u00e9 o\u00f9 il fait venir tous les officiers de\r\nCavalerie qu'il traite hautement.

Crozat, the daughter of the\r\nmillionaire,[2] and niece of Watteau's friend and early patron who\r\nwas ironically distinguished from his brother as Crozat le pauvre.\r\n\"Le petit Lingot\"--as the Countess d'Evreux was nicknamed by\r\nthe family of her husband--had, however, returned to her father's\r\nhouse, glad to take refuge in her \"chambre de jeune fille\" long\r\nbefore Pineau took in hand the magnificent decorations of the\r\npalace, which owed much of its splendour to her millions.[3]\r\n\r\nThese decorations were completed under the reign of the next\r\nowner, Madame de Pompadour, without any serious disturbance\r\nof the disposition of the rooms or the general treatment of the\r\ninterior, and thus we may still find at the Elys\u00e9e a superb example\r\nof that special type of decoration in which the panel and the mirror\r\nare combined. The boiseries of the \"Salle du Conseil,\" formerly\r\nthe \"Salon de musique\" of the H\u00f4tel d'Evreux, are amongst the\r\nfinest in Paris. In my opinion they can be rivalled only by some\r\nof Verberckt's splendid work at Versailles. As we look at them we\r\nrealize how much we owe to M. Emile Biais for his publication of\r\nthe very great number of original designs by Pineau with which\r\nhe has illustrated his pages. Again and again we are able to put\r\n\r\n1 M\u00e9m.

In 1715 he lent\r\nthree millions to the government of the Regent, and was allowed to buy the office of\r\n\"grand tr\u00e9sorier de l'ordre du Saint-Esprit\"--which carried with it the right to the\r\n\"cordon bleu\"--for 420,000 fr. Ten years later he was forced by the Duke de\r\nBourbon, then \"premier-ministre,\" to sell his place: \"on ne veut pas que ces charges\r\nsoient au premier venu qui aura de l'argent.\" Saint Simon, t. viii., p. 214, and M\u00e9m.\r\nMathieu Marais, t. i., p. 201, and t. iii., p. 88.\r\n\r\n3 Her death, in 1729, was followed by a lawsuit. \"M.

There\r\nis always the same weight and force in the mouldings, the same\r\nvigour in the scroll terminations by which they are received, the\r\nsame strident heads of beasts or birds are employed with the same\r\nentertaining fertility of invention.\r\n\r\nThe shells and arabesques on the golden panels at the Elys\u00e9e\r\nare enlivened after this fashion by fantastic birds of rare elegance,\r\nthe opposing curves of whose plumage are balanced with an instinct\r\nthat is the perfection of art, but an even more characteristic part\r\nof the decorations is to be found in the fine frieze of dragons drawn\r\nwith that accent of refined energy that gives a special attraction to\r\nthe whole work. Whilst one is conscious of a certain fiery movement\r\none sees at the same time the delicate restraint with which it\r\nis kept in hand. The science of \"les Contrastes\" in the hands of\r\nthis great French master evidently did not degenerate, except\r\nperhaps in trifles, into the kind of absurd licence with which\r\nCochin justly reproached both Meissonier and Oppenord.\r\n\r\nThe great importance which has evidently been attached to the\r\ndecoration of this splendid room, and the fact that it was intended\r\nas the \"Salon de musique,\" suggest the possibility that the project\r\noriginated with the \"petit Lingot,\" for the young Countess d'Evreux\r\nwas, like her uncle Pierre Crozat, a m\u00e9lomane. She is mentioned\r\nin the Memoirs of the day as figuring with the Marquise de\r\nCastellane and Mme. de la M\u00e9sang\u00e8re[2] at the meetings of the\r\n\"Concert italien\" started by Mme. de Prie, which, before taking\r\nup its quarters in the Louvre, had been given twice a week \"chez\r\nCrozat le jeune, curieux de musique.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe vandalism of the Second Empire has unfortunately left\r\nits traces on this beautiful Salon, which is now the scene of Cabinet\r\nCouncils at which M.

The\r\ngreat importance of the work in this room--where we find,\r\nhanging in the alcove, a fine tapestry after Coypel, of marvellous\r\nfreshness and beauty--reminds us that the \"Chambre \u00e0 coucher\"\r\nwas, in those days, one of the show or state apartments, and communicated\r\nusually with the Grand Cabinet, or principal Salle\r\nde r\u00e9ception.

In 1730, Pineau undoubtedly occupied the chief\r\nplace in his profession, and could afford to drop his pretensions to\r\nthe title of architect,[2] and take his stand as a ma\u00eetre-ornemaniste.\r\nAs one would expert, a goodly number of the great names of his\r\nday are to be found on his sketches.

In 1750, Mansart de Levy, who was\r\nengaged in the building at Asni\u00e8res,[4] of a magnificent ch\u00e2teau for\r\nthe marquis de Voyer, entrusted to Pineau the whole of the\r\ninterior decorations. \"Pineau,\" says d'Argenville, \"a donn\u00e9 les\r\ndessins et a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les ornemens des dedans.\" And,\r\namongst the sketches noted in the family papers are those for the\r\n\"Salle \u00e0 manger;\" for the Salon; for the Gallery; for that most\r\nimportant room, the \"Chambre \u00e0 coucher de la marquise,\" and,\r\nlastly, for the \"Salle de la Com\u00e9die de la maison de Monsieur le\r\nmarquis d'Argenson, \u00e0 Asni\u00e8re, 16 Mars 1751.\"[5] The Salle de\r\nCom\u00e9die had, at this date, become the distinguishing adjunct to\r\nall houses of great pretensions, and we are reminded that the first\r\ncare of the Duchess du Maine, on taking possession of the\r\nArsenal,[6] was for this indispensable addition.\r\n\r\nThe marquis de Voyer, who had hoped to succeed to the\r\ncoveted post of Directeur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des b\u00e2timents--baulked in his\r\nambition by the appointment of the favourite's uncle, de Tournehem,--left\r\nnothing undone which might establish his title to be\r\nconsidered the supreme, if unofficial, arbiter of fashion and of\r\n\r\n1 \"French Painters of the Eighteenth Century,\" p. 206.\r\n\r\n2 A.N.O.[1] 2248.

In 1730, Belle and\r\nCoypel were both employed on the \"bains de la Reine,\" and in\r\nthe same year we find the first mention of Jacques Verberckt[1] in\r\nthe Comptes des b\u00e2timents; 4,326 lt. are paid in that year to\r\n\"Dugoulon, Legoupil, and Verbereck\" for \"sculptures \u00e0 l'appartement\r\nde la Reine.\"[2]\r\n\r\nFrom this date the name of Verberckt figures in the accounts\r\nboth of Versailles and of Marly, where he worked at first with\r\nDugoulon[3] and afterwards with Legoupil, whose daughter,\r\nMarie-Madeleine, became his second wife.[4] These men, who are\r\nentered on the books under the heading \"sculpteurs,\" worked in-*\r\n\r\n1 1704-1771.

Long before Nicolas\r\nPineau returned to Paris from Russia, Verberckt, or Werbrech,[2] as\r\nhe is sometimes called, had forced his way to the front rank of the\r\ndecorators of Versailles. He was not only a ma\u00eetre of the despised\r\nAcademy of St. Luke; in 1733, at the age of twenty-eight, he became\r\nan agr\u00e9\u00e9 of the Royal Academy, and this date, in itself, seems\r\nto mark a certain increase of consequence, for in 1732, when changes\r\nand improvements were made in the King's apartments, he had\r\nbeen the chief of those employed, and the accounts of the following\r\nyear show a belated and considerable payment made to him for\r\n\"ouvrages de sculpture sur bois aux Cabinets et \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que\r\ndu Roi faits en 1732.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHis position at Versailles was then secure. \"Most of the\r\nsculptures of the old rooms,\" says Blondel, \"have been made by\r\nDugoulon and Roumier, two of the most skilful sculptors in wood\r\nof the beginning of the century. The sculptures carried out in\r\nour days are by the sieur Verbrek, draughtsman and sculptor of\r\ngreat merit in this genre.\"[4] It does not do to attach too much\r\nimportance to a coincidence, but it is a coincidence not without\r\ninterest that we find here the names of Dugoulon and Roumier\r\nspecially coupled, and that Dugoulon having--it is supposed--died\r\nin 1731, Roumier applied in 1733 for permission to leave\r\nFrance for Italy, whence, as far as we know, he never returned.\r\nCan it be that the \"S^r Roumier, sculpteur des b\u00e2timents du Roi\"\r\nfound himself, when deprived of the support of his old comrade\r\n\r\n1 For these entries, see \"Comptes des b\u00e2timents,\" etc., t. iv., p. 1294.\r\n\r\n2 D'Arg. \"Env.

He exhibited, it is\r\ntrue, at the Salon of 1737, to which he sent a composition described\r\nas \"Minerve qui enseigne et couronne les Arts,\" and he re-appeared,\r\nwith a group in plaster of \"Minerve et ses attributs,\" at the Salon\r\nof 1739, but after that date he ceased to contribute to the Salon.\r\nPossibly the anxieties and exigencies of his profession left Verberckt\r\nno time for the preparation of subjects for exhibition, and the same\r\nreason may also have prevented him from sending in the diploma\r\nwork without which he could not be distinguished as an academician.\r\n\r\nTo reconstitute Verberckt's share in the execution of decorations,\r\nmany of which have now disappeared, is a task not to be\r\nundertaken in these pages. As far as it is possible, it has been done\r\nwith admirable precision by the laborious researches, on the history\r\nof the court of Louis XV., and the works undertaken during his\r\nreign, which have been carried out with unflinching zeal by\r\nM. de Nolhac, the present active Conservateur of the palace.\r\nWhat I would here propose to do, is to try for some impression\r\nof the character of Verberckt's work, for a conception of its individuality,\r\nso that his name may have for us that clear artistic significance\r\nwhich it deserves. So much of what he did, for the\r\nch\u00e2teau of Versailles at any rate, is still remaining, that it is comparatively\r\neasy to follow him from room to room as he elaborated\r\nthose decorations by which he was occupied during forty of the\r\nbusiest years of his life.\r\n\r\nOf the first importance is the Chambre \u00e0 coucher de la Reine.[2]\r\nIn 1735, Marie Leczinska had enjoyed that exalted state for about\r\nten years, and one of the most interesting features of the room\r\nwhich was then arranged for her and which is so full of souvenirs,\r\nresults from the fact that it was again arranged for Marie-Antoinette\r\nwhen Madame la Dauphine[3] and--although three of the sides have\r\nbeen destroyed--it has remained one of the most beautiful in the\r\n\r\n1 The \"Permission accord\u00e9e au s^r Roumier, sculpteur, de faire le voyage d'Italie\"\r\nruns thus: \"A la requisition du s.

The \"bon du roi,\" which should give us\r\nthe sum paid for the work, is not forthcoming, but in the accounts\r\nfor 1735 and 1736 we find that heavy payments were made in\r\nthese years to Verberckt,[3] and these payments are so far beyond\r\nthose made during the same period to any other sculptor that the\r\nconclusion is inevitable as to his responsibility for the most important\r\nwork then executed. The treatment of the carvings, also,\r\nclosely resembles that of the work--still practically untouched--which\r\nwe know him to have carried out three years later (1738) in\r\nthe \"Chambre du roi.\"[4] The \"Chambre \u00e0 coucher de la Reine\"\r\nhas not been equally fortunate, for this typical example of the style\r\nof interior decoration, which had been originated by de Cotte, was\r\ndestroyed--as far as the general aspect was concerned--by Louis\r\nPhilippe, who, in spite of the protestations of the architect le\r\nNepveu, removed the mirrors on the sides of this room, in order\r\nto make space for the hanging of two large pictures of the age of\r\nLouis XIV. During a visit to Versailles paid on 4th June, 1834,\r\nthe king gave the peremptory orders which are cited by M. de\r\nNolhac in evidence of his flagrant bad taste: \"Take away the\r\nbeautiful chimney piece of the Queen's bedchamber with its gilt\r\nbronzes, pack it up properly; take down the mirrors and the\r\nframework of palm branches which accompanies them; in order\r\nto fix on the only remaining mirror the portrait of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\r\nor of the Emperor Joseph, and arrange the woodwork, frames and\r\ngildings of the two big paintings to be hung there.

Le Nepveu--to his honour\r\nbe it remembered--actually dared, in the teeth of the King's express\r\ncommands, to venture on remonstrance. In his report to the\r\n\"Directeur des b\u00e2timents,\" written immediately after the royal\r\nvisit, he observes \"that up to the present time all the changes\r\nordered have caused the disappearance of nothing noteworthy,\r\nwhether from the point of view of art or history; and that perhaps\r\nit would be wise to retain this credit to the account of the present\r\nrestoration, especially as regards a room to which foreigners pay\r\nespecial attention.\"[1] His objections were, as we now have cause\r\nto regret, authoritatively overruled.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent ceiling of this room, for which Boucher\r\nsupplied four \"cama\u00efeux,\"[2] had been very near destruction in 1770,\r\nwhen motives of economy--which found their advantage in Marie-Antoinette's\r\nimpatience to take possession of the apartment that\r\nhad been allotted to her on her marriage--suggested that it should\r\nbe replaced by plain white relieved only by a gilt frieze and rosette\r\nin the centre.[3] Jacques-Ange Gabriel, however, insisted on saving\r\nthe fine lines of the original work with a determination which\r\nshows how great was then the authority of the architect, and how\r\nworthy he was of the power which he exercised in dealing with\r\nthese questions. Repeated orders from Marigny were met by\r\nrepeated protests until, at last, Gabriel triumphed. \"Il m'est\r\nn\u00e9cessaire,\" he says in his final letter to Marigny, \"que vous ne\r\ncroyez pas que je cherche et inspire la d\u00e9pense; je ne fais n'y l'un\r\nny[**typo n'y?] l'autre, mais je ne proposerai jamais par aucune consid\u00e9ration,\r\n\r\n1 De Nolhac, \"Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles,\" p. 116.

If so, something of personal pride probably entered into\r\nhis defence of a decoration which had been admirably harmonised\r\nunder his own eye, when the lambris de marbre of a previous century\r\ndisappeared to make way for boiseries sculpt\u00e9es. In any case, the\r\nfragments which remain, the doors, the dessus de porte, and the\r\nnarrow panels which accompany them, present features which are\r\nthe same as those which mark all the later work which we know\r\nto have been carried out by Verberckt under Gabriel's supervision\r\nand control.\r\n\r\nWhilst the decorations of the Queen's bedchamber were yet in\r\nprogress Verberckt had been called to co-operate with Vass\u00e9, as we\r\nhave seen, in the decoration of the celebrated Salle d'Hercule or\r\nSalon de marbre. There, we may still find the famous frames--which\r\noriginally received the \"Noces de Cana\" and the companion\r\n\"Eli\u00e9zer et Rebecca,\" at that time also supposed to be\r\nthe work of Veronese[3]--both of which were undoubtedly due to\r\nVerberckt. On this question, my friend M. de Nolhac says in a\r\nletter, which I have recently received from him, that Verberckt\r\nwas paid in 1736, the sum of 1,560 livres \"pour ouvrages pl\u00e2tres et\r\nbois au grand Salon pr\u00e8s la Chapelle.\" He adds that there are\r\nother payments made to the same artist which may be referred to\r\nthe work carried out in the same Salon, but there are no precise\r\nindications of locality; in any case it is most likely that the doors\r\nof the Salon d'Hercule are also due to the chisel of Verberckt.\r\n\r\nIn 1738 we find him in the King's bedchamber, and it is\r\nworth notice that when at a later date (1746) alterations were made\r\nin the cabinets of Marie-Leczinska's apartment, Verberckt was\r\nengaged on one--the sculpture of which was reckoned at only\r\n959 livres--behind the bedchamber, which is described as the\r\n\"pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 niche.\" This \"pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 niche\" is shown by the plans to\r\nhave had exactly the same size and shape as the \"m\u00e9ridienne\" of\r\nMarie-Antoinette, the elegant form of which has been attributed\r\nto the taste of a later date.[4]\r\n\r\n1 Letter of the 26th September, 1770.

Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, although these rooms\r\nhave been a good deal pulled about, has saved it from destruction.\r\nIn the constant changes which were imposed by royal caprice we\r\nhave to be thankful that the Board of Works frequently distinguished\r\nitself by a wise economy,[2] and when, in 1760, one of\r\nthe most far-reaching of these alterations cost the Cabinet de la\r\nPendule its original oval termination, and left us the Cabinet\r\nd'Angle pretty much as we have it now, we find that even the fine\r\nlocks and bolts of the doors in the latter room were carefully\r\nretained, and that Marigny himself gave order that of the boiseries\r\n\"tout le vieux\" should be re-employed.\r\n\r\nIt is in these boiseries of Versailles and the Petit Trianon, that\r\nwe have the best opportunity of tracing the changes which, after\r\nthe death of de Cotte, represent that evolution in which the really\r\nroyal manner of the R\u00e9gence and of the early \"Style Louis XV.\"\r\ndevelops and then gradually descends to the graceful but effeminate\r\nelegance of the days of Louis XVI. The decorations yet remaining\r\nin these palaces show a style the rule of which never permitted\r\nfree expression to the exotic eccentricities which had captivated a\r\ncertain section even of the contemporary world of Paris. Under\r\nthe direction of de Cotte's successors we see first Verberckt and\r\nthen Rousseau producing ornament that is loftily and typically\r\nFrench, and we find this splendid character diminishing under the\r\nreign of Gabriel's successor, Richard Mique, to a more trivial art,\r\nwhich yet atones for the loss of dignity by the most exquisite\r\nworkmanship that the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nOn the panels of the Chambre of Marie-Leczinska, we have seen\r\nthe palm branch wreathed with flowers, as it is found in Harpin's\r\ndesigns for the petits appartements of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, after a\r\nfashion most characteristic of the earlier days of the century, and\r\nof which the most beautiful example adorns the mirrors of the\r\nSalon at the Arsenal. This decorative motive is no longer common\r\nafter 1750. In the Cabinet d'Angle, where--thanks to Marigny's\r\neconomy--we may still examine the work executed by Verberckt\r\n\r\n1 This room has passed as the \"Grand Cabinet,\" \"Cabinet Ovale,\" \"Cabinet des\r\nPendules,\" and \"Cabinet de la Pendule.\" It looks on the Cour de Marbre, and a\r\nfine drawing of its early state, showing the door between two oval panels and the\r\n\"cadrans du prieur de St. Cyr,\" from which it received for a time its name of\r\n\"Cabinet des Pendules,\" exists in the \"Archives.\" De Nolhac, \"Ch\u00e2teau de\r\nVersailles sous Louis XV.,\" pp. 40, 41, 42, 43.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., p. 69.",

The wreaths are there, but they are twisted about the\r\nelaborate and guilloched mouldings of the frames. Above the\r\nmirrors, too, are suspended other wreaths, the high relief of which\r\nrecalls the garlands of the Chambre de la Reine, but there are details\r\nof a different character. Chief of these--and as typical of\r\nVerberckt's genius as the rare elegance of proportion which distinguishes\r\nthe panels--must be cited the medallions in low relief\r\nrepresenting children's games which are a charming feature of a\r\ndecoration which taken as a whole is, I think, in finer taste than\r\nthat either of the \"Cabinet de la Pendule\" or the \"Grand Cabinet\"\r\nof Mme. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet d'Angle had assumed its present shape before the\r\ndeath of Mme. de Pompadour. As we stand within its walls we\r\nremember that it was a favourite retreat of Louis XV., who particularly\r\nliked to occupy it on account of the charming view which\r\nit commanded over both the Cour de marbre and the Cour du roi.\r\nWe remember, too, that it was from this balcony that--attended\r\nby Champlost, his \"premier valet de chambre\"--he watched\r\nthe funeral procession leaving the palace. \"Enfin,\" writes Dufort\r\nde Cheverny, \"le jour de l'enterrement de la marquise arriva.\r\nLe Roi, par les ordres de qui tout se faisait, savait l'heure. Il \u00e9tait\r\nsix heures du soir, en hiver, et par un temps d'ouragan \u00e9pouvantable\r\n... Le Roi prend Champlost par le bras; arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte\r\nde glace du Cabinet intime (donnant sur le balcon qui fait face \u00e0\r\nl'avenue de la Cour), il lui fait fermer la porte d'entr\u00e9e et se met\r\navec lui en dehors sur le balcon. Il garde un silence religieux,\r\nvoit le convoi enfiler l'avenue et ... le suit des yeux jusqu'\u00e0 ce\r\nqu'il perde de vue tout l'enterrement. Il rentre alors dans l'appartement;\r\ndeux grosses larmes coulaient encore le long de ses joues; et\r\nil ne dit \u00e0 Champlost que ce peu de mots: 'Voil\u00e0 les seuls devoirs\r\nque j'aie pu lui rendre.'\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn the Cabinet de la Pendule--so called in honour of the\r\nfamous clock by Passement, of which I must write later--Verberckt\r\nhad found himself face to face with the same problem that had\r\npresented itself in the Cabinet d'Angle. He had to recast, as it\r\nwere, and add to the decoration which he had executed seven years\r\n\r\n1 See \"Etat o\u00f9 sont actuellement les ouvrages du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, ce\r\n13 Juillet, 1753.\" De Nolhac, pp. 65, 66.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., pp. 68-70.\r\n\r\n3 Dufort de Cheverny, \"M\u00e9m. sur les R\u00e8gnes de Louis XV. et Louis XVI., etc.,\"\r\nt. i., p. 324.",

Only when M. de Nolhac drew my attention to the greater\r\nspirit and freedom of the carving of that one of these fine panels\r\nwhich is to the left of the chimney-piece, did I realize that the\r\nhand of the carver had been hampered ever so slightly in the\r\ncopies which he had made of his own earlier work. The outlines\r\nwhich encircle the graceful groups of children at the base of the\r\npanels remind us also of the transformations undergone by that\r\nfamiliar type of ornament the \"coquille \u00e0 rayons\"; the \"rayons\"\r\nhave disappeared, but the shell, having played many parts, is still\r\nto be faintly recognized in the curves which continue to suggest\r\nits shape.\r\n\r\nThe last work of Verberckt, at Versailles, is to be found in the\r\nroom which is persistently called the Salon de musique de Mme.\r\nAd\u00e9la\u00efde, although during nearly the whole of her term of\r\noccupation[1] it had possessed neither the size nor the shape which\r\nit acquired in 1767. These remained undisturbed when the\r\nking, her father, shortly after that date, took possession of her\r\napartment on the \u00e9tage royal--ostensibly to make ready for a\r\nsecond queen, but really, as M. de Nolhac suggests,[2] to facilitate\r\nthose relations with Mme. Dubarry which were then impending.\r\nOnce more Verberckt found himself called on to add new work\r\nto that which he had perfected not many years before, but he\r\ndid not succeed in solving the problem with success equal to\r\nthat which distinguished his re-handling of the Cabinet d'Angle.\r\nSome other influence not personal to himself seems to have inspired\r\nthe treatment of these panels which--as the plans still existing\r\nshow[3]--were added in 1767 to the work of 1753.\r\n\r\nThese panels are those which bear imposing trophies of\r\ninstruments of music, mixed with fishing tackle and garden tools,\r\nsurrounding escutcheons adorned with medallions on which are\r\nsculptured various appropriate groups. Both their subject and\r\ntheir treatment are so markedly different from that older work\r\nwhich is seen in the flower wreaths above the mirrors and on the\r\neight narrower panels that it strikes the eye at once.

The medallions in the centre of the\r\npanels, on which the games of children embody the labours of\r\nthe state, are of admirable art; every spray of the wreaths of\r\nolive, which accompany them, is varied with the greatest delicacy,\r\nevery curve is full of quality and play--free yet subtle.\r\n\r\nThroughout this fine work we find bolder relief, more force\r\nof accent, bolder handling even than are habitual to Verberckt.\r\nOne asks, in the presence of handling so vigorous, whether it is the\r\npure result of temperament or whether it indicates rather the\r\nhabit of hand and eye acquired by men not to be described, like\r\nNicolas Pineau, as sculpteurs en bois solely, but who wrought in\r\nstone or marble with as easy familiarity as in wood, a practice\r\nwhich, in the later years of his career, Verberckt seems to have\r\nabandoned, and I note that Guibert, Vernet's brother-in-law, who\r\nwas then working at the Petit Trianon, betrays the same tendencies.\r\n\r\n\"Les ornements de sculpture,\" writes d'Argenville, visiting\r\nthe Petit Trianon in 1768, \"du plus grand fini de la plus belle\r\nex\u00e9cution sont de la main de M. Guibert, beau-fr\u00e8re de M. Vernet,\"[2]\r\nand the wood carvings of the Salle \u00e0 manger and the Salle de\r\ncompagnie are absolutely of the same character as the sculpture\r\nof the marble chimney-pieces. Of these, that in the Salle \u00e0\r\nmanger, by its combination of flat treatment--in the border of\r\nfruit and leaves--with the full relief of the supporting rams' heads\r\non either side, reaches the finer character. In the Salle de\r\ncompagnie the garlands of flowers are heavy and confuse the\r\nlines of the work. The same impression of weight is produced\r\nby the carving on the panels in this room, for the shell-curved\r\nlines which maintain their decorative value in the Salle \u00e0 manger\r\nhave here completely disappeared, and the natural treatment of\r\nthe lilies reminds us that the science of botany had an amiable\r\nside appreciated not only by Mme. de Pompadour, but by Mme.\r\nDubarry and by the Queen, who were her successors in the\r\n\"pavilion.\" The chisel of the sculptor is also plainly suggested\r\nby the handling of the mask which brings an air of classic\r\n\r\n1 De Nolhac, \"Le Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles sous Louis XV.,\" p. 39.\r\n\r\n2 \"Env.

Still more significant of the new influence is the square\r\nformality with which the panels are disposed; the day of the\r\nstraight line is at hand. We have but to turn back to the \"anti-chambre\"--where\r\neconomy has retained at the side of later work\r\na fine panel, doubtless by Verberckt, for it is of the same design\r\nas those carved by him for the \"Salon frais\" planned in 1746[3]--to\r\nfind mouldings and shell curves of delicate art relieved by\r\nfoliated sprays in low relief and accompanied by garlands more\r\nsharply defined.

The son claimed that all these different sums\r\nshould be placed in his hands, but the four girls insisted that,\r\nthough they trusted him, they preferred that \"la dame Morisseau,\r\ncharg\u00e9e par leur p\u00e8re de leur \u00e9ducation et la d\u00e9pense de la maison\"\r\nshould retain the balance of that which he had given to her. The\r\nmatter was settled by an appeal to the \"p\u00e8re Beville, Feuillant\"\r\nwho, they said, knew their father's mind, and by him it was\r\ndecided \"qu'il leur sera remis \u00e0 chacune d'elle la somme de cinq\r\ncens livres pour subvenir \u00e0 leurs frais de deuil ... que le surplus,\r\nensemble ce qui peut rester entre les mains de la demoiselle\r\nMorisseau, sera remis aud.

The boiserie of the\r\nprincipal room showed a tall mirror wreathed with roses and supported\r\non either side by panels,--shell-carven, and set with bouquets\r\nof flowers.[3] With its help we are able to re-construct the background\r\nto the quadrille table, at which the sculptor and his friends,\r\nin stately fauteuils, had been wont to sit at the cards,[4] illumined\r\nby the double-branched candelabra of cuivre dor\u00e9, whilst dame\r\nMorisseau and her charges served the coffee. For Madame de\r\nPompadour herself, Verberckt could but have translated his own\r\nsurroundings into circumstances of greater state and materials of\r\ngreater cost.\r\n\r\nThe construction of his dwelling, its two numbers and the great\r\nextent of its site--having not only a fa\u00e7ade on the boulevard and a\r\ncourt with many rooms looking into it, but others giving on the\r\ngarden and conservatory--is perhaps to be explained by the fact\r\nthat his workshops--those ateliers which were filled by so many\r\nadmirable workers--were not at Versailles as might be supposed,\r\nbut under his own roof. When this was the case--as we shall see\r\nwhen we come to the cabinet-makers--the great artist-artisans all\r\nseem to have endeavoured to obtain the command of corner houses,\r\nor houses in parallel streets, communicating by the back, so that\r\nthey might keep their dwelling-place free from business, yet be\r\nwithin touch of their workshops.\r\n\r\n1 For all these details, see \"Scell\u00e9,\" N.A., 1885, pp. 13-18.\r\n\r\n2 De Champeaux, \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif,\" pp. 324-326.\r\n\r\n3 Calliat et Lance, \"Encyclop\u00e9die d'Architecture,\" t. xii., pl. 10. \"Grand Salon.\r\nGlace et panneaux sculpt\u00e9s.\"\r\n\r\n4 In this connexion one may recall that \"une table \u00e0 piquet couverte de son drap\r\nvert\" stood in the \"anti-chambre ayant vue sur la Cour.\"",
  "106.png": "\r\nThe fact that Verberckt died in easy circumstances is surprising\r\nwhen we consider his treatment by the Crown. Again and again in\r\ncommunications made to the Board of Works, by agents either\r\nurging the delivery of work or insisting on the necessity for\r\npayment of debts long overdue, we come on references to the\r\ntemper of the workmen at the headquarters in Paris. In 1750,\r\nwhen Verberckt was working in the famous \"appartement au rez de\r\nchauss\u00e9e,\" which Mme. de Pompadour had finally succeeded in wresting\r\nfrom the Countess de Toulouse and the Duke de Penthi\u00e8vre,\r\na report, made to her uncle, de Tournehem, on the 16th October,\r\nstates that \"Il ne nous est point encore venu de menuiserie de\r\nParis pour l'appartement de Mme. la Marquise de Pompadour....\r\nLes sieurs Guesnon[1] et Verbereckt y apportent toute l'attention\r\nqu'ils peuvent ... je ne puis cependant, Monsieur, vous dissimuler\r\nque les moiens leur manquent absolument. Le sieur\r\nVerbereckt, par le d\u00e9compte que je fis derni\u00e8rement dans ses atteliers,\r\na pour 300 livres au moins d'ouvriers \u00e0 payer tous les jours,\r\nuniquement emploi\u00e9s \u00e0 cet apartement[** appartement ?], et il lui reste encore\r\nd\u00fb de 1747, sur le d\u00e9partement de Versailles, 37,812 livres.\r\nJe le trouvai constern\u00e9, ne sachant comment pouvoir continuer cette\r\nd\u00e9pense sans argent.\"[2] Payment on this occasion was, of course,\r\nmade at once, work for Mme. de Pompadour could not wait, but\r\nthe situation incessantly repeated itself. In 1767 \"Verberckt, sur\r\nle Cabinet de Mme. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, 2,000 l.,\" appears on another list\r\nconcerning which the same representations are made. \"I must\r\nbring to your notice,\" writes the superintendant[** typo superintendent] of the works, \"my\r\nextreme embarrassment to be obliged to make a great number of\r\nworkmen labour day and night who would have left several days\r\nago except for the promises I made them that they should receive\r\ntheir money. They count upon it so positively, that after next\r\nSunday the greater part will leave.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAgain the money was found. It always was found to satisfy\r\nthose whose services were indispensable to the private pleasures of\r\nthe King. However enormous the cost, however unpropitious\r\nthe circumstances of France, nothing hindered him from carrying\r\non the incessant alterations on which the best energies of the\r\nmost brilliant artists of the day were recklessly expended. Again\r\nand again, like Verberckt, they saw their work complete only to\r\nbe called on to assist in its destruction, and one remembers the\r\n\r\n1 It will be remembered that Watteau painted \"La Perspective\"--the background\r\nof which, Mariette tells us, is a view of the garden belonging to Crozat at Montmorency--for\r\n\"M.

He had, however, at his command, the help of his\r\ndistinguished sons, and with them in 1773 he was employed on\r\nthe Chapel of the Petit Trianon.\r\n\r\nThe following year (1774) finds them engaged with their\r\nfather on the celebrated \"Salon de la m\u00e9ridienne\" of the \"petits\r\nappartements,\"[3] and when Marie-Antoinette at last obtained possession\r\nof the rooms of Marie-Leczinska, Jules-Antoine Rousseau\r\nmodelled the four Austrian eagles for the ceiling of her bed-*chamber[** both with and without hyphen in this work].\r\nTo him, also, we owe some part of the principal\r\ndecorations executed in the bedchamber of Mme. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde--a\r\nroom which afterwards became the library of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nAll this later work, in which we find the talent of Jules-Antoine\r\nRousseau, as it were, transformed and lending itself with\r\nthe utmost pliancy to the satisfaction of those demands for irreproachable\r\nelegance which became more and more exacting with\r\nevery day, may still be judged in the perfection of its special\r\nexcellence. The \"Bains du roi\" still shows its delicate reliefs,\r\nand in the \"Garde-robe de Louis XVI.,\" remodelled and redecorated\r\nin 1788 and gilt in 1789, we may still measure the extraordinary\r\nsuppleness of a gift which permitted one and the same man to\r\ngive us the splendid reliefs of the Cabinet du roi and then handle\r\nwith felicitous excellence the delicate miniatures of the \"Bains\"\r\nand the even more delicate ornament of the \"Garde-robe.\" To\r\nthe happy fruit which was the outcome of the training received\r\nunder so great an artist, the walls of the \"Boudoir de Madame\r\n\r\n1 D'Argenson, t. v., p. 464.\r\n\r\n2 De Nolhac, \"Le Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles sous Louis XV.,\" p. 230.

Without doubt, the curious likeness\r\nwhich exists between the boudoir at South Kensington and the\r\nroom at Fontainebleau counts for something in the legend which\r\nrepresents the Queen as having had a direct share in the direction\r\nand execution of the work, and has suggested the name of \"boudoir\r\nde Marie-Antoinette\" by which this marvel was known when\r\nbought for the Museum.[1]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 8th April, 1869, that the purchase was proposed,\r\nin London, to the Department of Science and Art. In the minutes\r\nof the official sittings we read, under that date, that a little room,\r\nsixteen feet high, fourteen feet long, and ten feet six inches wide,\r\nwhich had been taken down and carried away, about two years\r\nearlier, from a house in the rue Saint-Louis, was to be inspected\r\nby Sir Digby Wyatt, and, should he approve the purchase, bought\r\nfor the sum of sixty thousand francs. On the 22nd of the same\r\nmonth, Sir Digby Wyatt writes from Paris: \"They give the\r\nfollowing account of this boudoir: M. de S\u00e9rilly, one of the\r\n'tr\u00e9soriers-payeurs de l'arm\u00e9e' under Louis XVI., living in the old\r\nrue Saint-Louis in the Marais, married one of the favourite maids\r\nof honour of Marie-Antoinette. During a temporary absence of\r\nM. de S\u00e9rilly from Paris, his wife, wishing to give him a surprise\r\non his return, succeeded, with the aid of the Queen, in constructing\r\nand decorating this boudoir. The house passed from the S\u00e9rilly\r\nfamily to a certain M. Saint-Albin, who sold it, through M. Achille\r\nJubinal,[2] to M. R\u00e9cap\u00e9. Without asserting the truth of the story,\r\nI see no special reason for throwing doubt on it. The work speaks\r\nfor itself, as having been executed by the most skilful artists and\r\nworkmen of the day of Marie-Antoinette.\" In consequence of\r\nthis report, a prompt decision was taken by the committee, and\r\nfrom the ticket bearing the particulars of its purchase, which is\r\nannexed to the letter, we learn that the boudoir was bought, as\r\n\r\n1 The tradition might also be accounted for if the artists employed on its execution\r\nwere men specially attached to the \"b\u00e2timents de la Reine.\"\r\n\r\n2 Recent information enables me to correct this statement: the h\u00f4tel of the comte\r\nde Corbeau Saint-Albin, was, in 1869, the property of his sister, Madame Achille\r\nJubinal, n\u00e9e Hortense de Corbeau Saint-Albin.",

Paul R\u00e9cap\u00e9, for sixty\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it did not seem likely that one could gather\r\nmore complete information as to this pretty room than that\r\ntransmitted by M. R\u00e9cap\u00e9 to Sir Digby Wyatt; but for some\r\ninexplicable reason, the names of Fragonard and Natoire were\r\ngratuitously attached to it. The blunder, however it may have\r\noriginated, was consecrated, ten years later, by the publication of\r\nthe important volume, \"Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, sa Vie et son \u0152uvre,\"\r\nin which the author, M. de Portalis, catalogued the \"Boudoir\r\nS\u00e9rilly\" as \"Boudoir de l'H\u00f4tel de Bergeret, rue du Temple\" in\r\nthe list given of paintings by Fragonard, completing his description\r\nin the words, \"Plafond peint par Natoire, ainsi que les dessus de\r\nportes; les panneaux et les embrasures de fen\u00eatre peints en ornements\r\nall\u00e9goriques par Fragonard, et les fleurs par Mme.

A few years\r\nlater, however, M. de Champeaux came to the rescue and brought\r\nforward fresh information, which he has since incorporated in his\r\nresearches on \"La Peinture d\u00e9corative\" and \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans\r\nle vieux Paris,\" a work to which--in spite of occasional slips--every\r\nstudent of the subject must be constantly indebted. M. de\r\nChampeaux confirms the details given to Sir Digby Wyatt by\r\nM. Paul R\u00e9cap\u00e9, and adds that the decoration of the house in the\r\nrue Saint-Louis is to be ascribed to the architect Ledoux,[3] Blondel's\r\npupil, who constructed the celebrated h\u00f4tel of Mlle. Guimard,\r\nthe \"Temple de Terpsichor\u00e9,\" formerly situated in the rue de la\r\nChauss\u00e9e d'Antin.\r\n\r\nThere Fragonard had worked with Ledoux,[4] and it is probably\r\n\r\n1 See \"French Painters of the Eighteenth Century,\" p. 4.\r\n\r\n2 P. 272.\r\n\r\n3 1736-1806.

Luciennes is said to have been finished in\r\nthree months, and it is worth note that though the final payments to Ledoux were\r\nonly made in March, 1776, we find Vernet taking down pictures for the ch\u00e2teau in\r\nMay, 1772 (A. de l'A. fr., v. iii., p. 339).\r\n\r\n4 \"French Painters of the Eighteenth Century,\" p. 63.",

The place of \"Ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates,\"\r\nwhich M. de S\u00e9rilly filled in succession to his father, and the post\r\nwhich Mme. de Pauge had occupied about the Queen, fixed them\r\nat the Court, where they made a great figure. The title of\r\n\"Marquis\" frequently given to M. de S\u00e9rilly, was only a \"titre de\r\ncour,\" that is to say a courtesy title, not resulting from the\r\n\"\u00e9rection en marquisat d'une de leurs terres,\" nor transmissible to\r\ntheir descendants, who, in fact, do not bear it. It was one of the\r\nabuses of the day which had become a custom, and by which\r\nM. de S\u00e9rilly and his wife profited, as did many other families at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMadame de S\u00e9rilly, her husband and her brother-in-law, Baron\r\nd'Etigny, major-general of the army of Flanders, were specially\r\nattached to Mme. Elisabeth de France.[3] During the Revolution,\r\nthey kept up secret relations with her, and were implicated by the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal in the \"conspiration\" which supplied the\r\npretext for her condemnation. The names of all three are to be\r\nfound on the list of the four-and-twenty persons of different rank\r\n\r\nowner of this important collection is an employ\u00e9 of the Ministry of War, but the\r\nletter which I addressed to him there having received no reply, I can only reproduce\r\nthe account given by M. de Champeaux.\r\n\r\n1 The family is now represented by the baronne douairi\u00e8re d'Etigny, n\u00e9e de\r\nVoulx--who is the grandchild of a Mlle. de Monclar--by her daughter-in-law, and\r\nby a child of five or six, the last of the name of d'Etigny.\r\n\r\n2 The family de Megret, originally of Picardy, was ennobled in 1408, in the\r\nperson of Guillaume de Megret, Secretary to King Charles VI. Several branches\r\nsprang from this stock, two of which still exist. That of Etigny came from Picardy\r\nto Burgundy by the marriage, in 1670, of Nicolas de Megret with Magdelaine\r\nMennechet, Dame d'Etigny, de S\u00e9rilly, de Passy, etc.\r\n\r\n3 The bust of Mme. de S\u00e9rilly, and a bust said to be that of Madame Elisabeth de\r\nFrance, were companions in the collection of Sir Richard Wallace, and are now placed\r\nvis-\u00e0-vis at Hertford House. This second bust, which represents an elderly woman,\r\ncannot however be that of Mme. Elisabeth, who died at the age of thirty. See p. 64.",
  "117.png": "sentenced to death with Madame Elisabeth. Mme. de S\u00e9rilly,\r\nwho was then thirty-one, desired to die with her husband, her\r\nbrother-in-law, and the Princess, but Mme. Elisabeth saved her\r\nlife, against her will, by making a false declaration, that she was\r\nabout to be a mother. Mme. Elisabeth and the others were\r\ntherefore guillotined on 27th May, 1794; and Mme. de S\u00e9rilly--having\r\nbeen detained in prison for some weeks--was liberated after\r\nthe fall of Robespierre.[1]\r\n\r\nThe family to which she belonged was, for generations,\r\nrenowned for the extraordinary beauty of its men as well as of its\r\nwomen, and Mme. de S\u00e9rilly herself, as her bust bears witness--although\r\nit does not, perhaps, impress one as much as might be\r\nexpected from the great reputation which her looks enjoyed--made\r\nno exception to the rule. I have dwelt at this length on\r\nthe facts of her life, because--as we shall see--they are of the\r\ngreatest importance in determining, beyond dispute, the date at\r\nwhich the boudoir, now at South Kensington, was carried out.\r\n\r\nThe rue de Saint-Louis, in which the hotel of M. de S\u00e9rilly\r\nwas situated, was, at the time of his marriage to his cousin, one of\r\nthe finest in Paris. Piganiol de la Force, in 1742, speaks of it on\r\nthis wise: \"La rue neuve Saint-Louis s'est nomm\u00e9 quelque fois la\r\nrue de l'Egout couvert, \u00e0 cause qu'elle couvre les \u00e9gouts qui y\r\nviennent de la rue Saint-Antoine de la Place Royale, et le nom\r\nSaint-Louis lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 parce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e sous le\r\nr\u00e8gne de Louis XII. On la nomme \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent la rue Saint-Louis\r\nou Saint-Louis au Marais. C'est une des plus larges et des plus\r\nbelles rues de Paris.\"[2] It was there, at No. 106, that, on the\r\nground floor, since occupied by M. Dasson, a manufacturer of\r\nfurniture and bronzes, our boudoir was preserved intact up to\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nThe early date of 1767, which, when I wrote an account of\r\nthe Boudoir for the \"Gazette des Beaux Arts\" in 1898, I showed\r\n\r\n1 M. de Monclar says: \"Madame de S\u00e9rilly, sortie de la tourmente, ... sentit le\r\nbesoin de s'assurer une protection \u00e0 ses jeunes enfants et elle ne tarda pas \u00e0 se\r\nremarier \u00e0 son cousin le chevalier de Pauge. Marie-Fran\u00e7ois-Denis-Thomas, chevalier\r\nde Pauge, n\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris le 9 novembre 1764, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un publiciste tr\u00e8s remarqu\u00e9.

It is now certain that it is\r\nof a later period, and was probably carried out in 1780, if not\r\nlater. In 1767 Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re was barely twenty, and\r\nwas to all appearances absorbed by his work as a Royal Academy\r\nstudent, for I find in the Proc\u00e8s-verbaux of the 24th September,\r\n1768, that \"le nomm\u00e9 Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re a m\u00e9rit\u00e9 le premier\r\nprix.\" This first prize was the medal awarded to the best painter\r\nfor the quarter, and the register shows this entry \"M\u00e9dailles du\r\nquartier, 1^{re}, Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re, peintre.\"\r\n\r\nHis age can also be fixed with absolute certainty, as we find\r\nfrom his baptismal certificate[1] that he was born on the 18th\r\nFebruary, 1747, and that he was the son of \"Sieur Jules-Antoine\r\nRousseau, sculpteur du roi,\" and of Marie-Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Auger,\r\nhis wife. M. de Nolhac, who has kindly sent me a copy of this\r\ndocument, also tells me that the Rousseau family came from\r\nCorbeil;[2] he adds that Jean-Sim\u00e9on and his brother appeared\r\nfor the first time in the \"Comptes des B\u00e2timents\" as \"associ\u00e9s \u00e0\r\nleur p\u00e8re\" in 1774, the date at which there are entries of sums\r\npaid to the \"sieurs Rousseau p\u00e8re et fils,\" but in his recent\r\nvolume on the \"Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles sous Louis XV.,\" the\r\nlearned keeper of the palace cites a mention of the \"sieurs\r\nRousseau, sculpteurs, sur la Petite galerie du roi,\" which is of\r\nan earlier date--1767; but this refers in all probability not to\r\nour Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re, but to the co-operation with his\r\nfather of the elder brother Rousseau.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of the boudoir of Mme. de S\u00e9rilly cannot\r\nbe earlier than the date of her marriage, which took place--I\r\nlearn from the kindness of Mme. la baronne d'Etigny, to whom\r\nmy friend M. de Monclar applied on my behalf--on October 14th,\r\n1779. One may, however, ask what Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re\r\nwas doing in the years which succeeded his first successes at the\r\nAcademy in 1768? The reply to this question presents itself to\r\n\r\n1 Actes de l'\u00e9tat civil de Versailles, r\u00e9gistre de la paroisse Notre-Dame, bapt\u00eames,\r\n1747, fol. 14: \"L'An 1747, le dix-neuf f\u00e9vrier, Jean-Sim\u00e9on, n\u00e9 d'hier, fils de Jules-Antoine\r\nRousseau, sculpteur du Roi et de Marie-Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Auger, son \u00e9pouse,\r\na \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9 par nous, pr\u00eatre soussign\u00e9, faisant les fonctions curiales.

Such a state of things was necessarily\r\nintolerable; but Cochin adds: \"La plus grande partie \u00e9tant oblig\u00e9s\r\nd'exercer leur talent dans diff\u00e9rens arts pour en vivre et beaucoup\r\nde ces arts n'exigeant pas un plus haut degr\u00e9 de science dans le\r\ndessin, la plupart cessent d'y venir (\u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie) lorsquils ont\r\ngagn\u00e9 les m\u00e9dailles et l'on n'y voit gu\u00e8re d'assiduit\u00e9 que dans ceux\r\nqui concourent \u00e0 ces m\u00e9dailles ou qui se destinent \u00e0 la peinture de\r\nl'histoire ou \u00e0 la sculpture statuaire.\"\r\n\r\nIt must, therefore, be supposed that Jean-Sim\u00e9on--not having\r\nthe intention of devoting himself either to \"la peinture de l'histoire\r\nou \u00e0 la sculpture statuaire\"--ceased to attend the classes of the\r\nAcademy as soon as he had won his medal.[2] In all probability he\r\nat once found work with his father, or, if it were necessary that\r\nhe should make further special studies, followed the course of\r\ninstruction opened by the Academy of Saint Luke, where the\r\nstudents found teaching which they would have sought in vain--a\r\npoint to which Cochin draws attention with bitter complaints--at\r\nthe Royal Academy.[3] For those who specially intended to\r\ndevote themselves to the decorative arts, the classes of the ma\u00eetrise\r\noffered at this time the most legitimate attractions. In their\r\nateliers, Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re would have found, exercising\r\nthe functions of professors, Attiret,[4] the charming sculptor who\r\nmodelled the beautiful \"Head of a Young Girl\" (Collection\r\nMarcille) belonging to Mme. Jahan, Martincourt, the master of\r\nGouthi\u00e8re, and Delafosse.\r\n\r\nThe employment of Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re by Madame de\r\nS\u00e9rilly for the decoration of her boudoir was a matter of course,\r\n\r\n1 22nd December, 1764. See Courajod, \"Ecole Royale des El\u00e8ves prot\u00e9g\u00e9s,\" etc.,\r\np. 69.\r\n\r\n2 Another Rousseau figures on the books, as having obtained \"une premi\u00e8re\r\nm\u00e9daille de quartier,\" December 31, 1773; but he must not be confounded with\r\nRousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re. He was probably the Rousseau alluded to in a letter of\r\nPierre to d'Angiviller (December 24, 1774), to which M. de Nolhac has called my\r\nattention: \"Le S^r Rousseau,\" says Pierre, \"parait sage. Ses ouvrages ne sont pas au\r\ndegr\u00e9 o\u00f9 ils parviendront s'il \u00e9tudie et surtout si son petit go\u00fbt maigre, d\u00e9faut sans\r\ndoute de l'\u00e9cole o\u00f9 il \u00e9tudie, est corrig\u00e9 par la comparaison des choses mieux faites\r\ndans ce genre.\" This Rousseau is, I think, the engraver for whom Cochin got a commission\r\nto reproduce the diploma work of Jouvenet (P. V., August 4th, 1781), and his\r\nname figures now in the \"Catalogue de la Chalcographie,\" under the heading,\r\n\"Description de l'Egypte.\"\r\n\r\n3 Guiffrey, \"Expositions de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Saint-Luc,\" p. vii.\r\n\r\n4 See \"French Architects and Sculptors,\" pp. 145, 146.",

It is indeed not unlikely\r\nthat the bust which figures in the Wallace Collection--in\r\ncompany with that of Mme. de S\u00e9rilly--as that of Mme. Elisabeth,\r\nmay be the one of Mme. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde exhibited by Houdon in 1777.[2]\r\nMr. Claude Phillips traces in the features a certain resemblance\r\nto Catherine of Russia, and we await for a final decision further\r\ninformation to be supplied by Mme. d'Etigny.\r\n\r\nIf the choice of Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re as the decorator was\r\ndetermined by the family relations with Madame Elisabeth and the\r\nhousehold of Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, the selection of Ledoux as the\r\narchitect was distinctly indicated by social ties. The marquise\r\nde S\u00e9rilly and her cousin, Pauline de Beaumont, belonged to a\r\nfashionable set which had pretensions to taste not only in art, but\r\nin letters, and reckoned Joubert and Condorcet amongst its chief\r\nillustrations. Ledoux was closely in touch with them, and had\r\nrecently achieved a brilliant success with the h\u00f4tel built by him\r\nfor Condorcet in the rue Chantereine.[3]\r\n\r\nThe date at which de la Rotti\u00e8re planned the boudoir of\r\nMme. de S\u00e9rilly was probably soon after her marriage, and may\r\nbe assumed as about 1780-82. In 1783--judging from the dates\r\non his drawings--he had his hands full at Versailles with work\r\nfor the Queen, which was followed two years later by the work\r\nat Fontainebleau, for which the complicated variety of technique\r\napplied in the S\u00e9rilly boudoir served as a preliminary exercise.\r\nThe triumphant skill employed to get the most possible out of\r\nthe proportions imposed by the restricted space at command may\r\nbe placed to the account of the ingenious architect, but it must\r\nbe admitted that his intentions have been abetted by Rousseau de\r\nla Rotti\u00e8re with rare intelligence and tact. Having to deal with\r\na space of height totally disproportionate to its other dimensions,\r\nyet insufficient to cut into two storys--after the plan followed by\r\nPierre Rousseau in the arrangement of the Queen's boudoir at\r\nFontainebleau--Ledoux divided it by contriving four arched\r\n\r\n1 See p. 59, note 4.\r\n\r\n2 See \"French Architects and Sculptors,\" p. 138.\r\n\r\n3 In this h\u00f4tel Josephine was living when she married Bonaparte, and the 18th\r\nBrumaire was planned under its roof.

On the four square pilasters--the insides of which are\r\narranged to carry the shelves of bookcases--rest the four arches\r\nwhich mark out the two windows, the door and the chimney-place.\r\nEach of the pictures in the upper lunettes, the work of Lagren\u00e9e le\r\njeune, represents one of the four elements, and that which surmounts\r\nthe door--a Vulcan with fine draperies of lilac and purple--appears\r\nto be much the best of the set. The full tones of these paintings\r\nprepare the eye for the even fuller colour of the ceiling, in which\r\none sees Jupiter seated on his throne. It is enframed in a\r\nmagnificent border of a deep blue, on which are detached red\r\nmedallions and shells in dead silver. This same hue of oxydized\r\nsilver is again found in the bodies of the children who play on the\r\nblue ground of the border, accompanied by arabesques of gold and\r\nsilvered foliage.\r\n\r\nOn the walls one sees figures in very low relief, which symbolize\r\nthe Four Seasons. The panels, long and narrow, are\r\ncovered with appropriate attributes; groups of Loves--busy with\r\nthe tasks of Spring, of Summer, of Autumn, and of Winter--adorn\r\nmedallions of varied and delicate hue. Other little Loves fly here\r\nand there; bouquets and garlands of flowers droop from vases of\r\njasper and of lapis, shepherdesses confide the care of their hats to\r\nthe doves whose flight enlivens the panels of the shutters; and all\r\nthese exuberant fantasies, all this colour, all these tints of silver\r\nand shining gold are impregnated with that peculiar hue of faded\r\nrose-lilac, which is also the dominant note at Fontainebleau, in the\r\n\"boudoir de la reine.\"\r\n\r\nOne forgets even the absurdity of the ridiculous row of\r\ncandelabra, painted by de la Rotti\u00e8re \"en trompe l'\u0153il,\" with their\r\nsham candles all round the little room about half-way up the\r\nwalls--probably to further attenuate the great impression of its\r\nheight--in delight at the general aspect of fairy-like elegance and\r\nthe precision, the skill lavished in the treatment of every detail,\r\nthe masterly finish of the whole ornamentation, whether modelled\r\nor carved--as, for example, the twisted pattern employed on the",

That he was in the\r\nhighest degree competent to direct such work there is no manner\r\nof doubt, for the details of the decoration of the graceful H\u00f4tel de\r\nSalm still bear testimony to the purity and refinement of his taste.\r\nIt was the general custom, as we have seen, that the artists of those\r\ndays, to whom the interior decoration of a building was entrusted,\r\nshould receive from the architect the broad outline and indication\r\nof the style and character which they were expected to give to\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nThese preparatory plans left, we must remember, a wide\r\nmargin to the interpretation of the practised men to whom they\r\nwere given, and at an earlier epoch the same latitude was authorized\r\nby the painters of the cartoons which the workmen of the Gobelins\r\ntransformed into woven pictures with an amazing instinct and\r\ncraft. The good old traditions which gave a free hand to the\r\nweavers of the \"Manufacture,\" were, as we shall see, remorselessly\r\ntrampled under foot by Oudry, but the grace and infinite\r\nvariety by which such of the interior decorations of this century\r\nas have escaped destruction are distinguished, bear witness to the\r\nindependence which was retained by all decorators. Nowhere\r\ndoes this independence assert itself in a more brilliant fashion than\r\nin the application and development of the style, which is kindred\r\nto the \"style pomp\u00e9ien,\" of which the boudoir of Mme. de S\u00e9rilly\r\nis the type.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of this boudoir is, I think, of a transitional\r\ncharacter, and in all probability its execution preceded that of\r\nthe boudoir at Fontainebleau. When, shortly after the middle of\r\nthe century, the influence of the wall-paintings discovered at Herculaneum\r\nand at Pompeii made itself plainly felt, the change was\r\ngradual. The sphinx and the classic urn found a place--as we\r\nhave seen in the wood-carvings of Guibert at the Petit Trianon--in\r\nthe leading lines of the most marked type of anterior decoration.\r\nTheir introduction seems to have been followed by that of\r\nmedallions in imitation of the cameo, not such as were em-*\r\n\r\n1 R.

No more admirable illustration can be\r\nfound of this type, than a panel belonging to the \"Union\r\ndes Arts d\u00e9coratifs,\" in which the medallion, relieved by eagles'\r\nwings, is accompanied by a fine arabesque of foliage in varied\r\nvalues of relief. At the same time, however, the tendency is more\r\nand more evident which makes for the effacement of relief:\r\neverywhere the framework of the panels receives less and less\r\naccent, whilst the popular beadings and plaits and the acanthus\r\nornaments are treated with microscopical precision. Pseudo-classic\r\nmedallions continue to multiply under the most diverse shapes, and\r\nthe scrollwork by which they are accompanied gradually loses\r\nits spring, until the decorative scheme which, for the boudoir\r\nS\u00e9rilly, has taxed all the powers of the artist's invention, realizes\r\na somewhat diminished if rare type of elegance, such as that of\r\nwhich the Fontainebleau boudoir remains the most perfect example.\r\n\r\nOn this wise we reach a point at which all the elements of\r\nthe earlier style, which still retained its hold when Louis XVI.\r\ncame to the throne, completely disappear. In the beautiful pseudo-pompeian\r\ndecoration which now belongs to the Duke de Rivoli\r\nand which comes from a h\u00f4tel of the rue Saint-Georges, once\r\ninhabited by Barras, one sees even better than at Fontainebleau or\r\nCompi\u00e8gne, how impossible it is for an artist, even an artist as\r\noriginal as Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re, to escape the action of contemporary\r\nfashion. When I first saw a portion of this decoration,\r\nbefore it came into the possession of the duke, I conjectured that\r\nit had been executed as late as 1795, but Krafft and Ransonnette\r\nshow that the h\u00f4tel in the rue Saint-Georges was built by Ledoux,\r\nfor an American named Hostein, in 1787.[1] We, may therefore,\r\nassume that the decoration was executed much earlier than I had\r\nsupposed, that in fact it was probably the work which followed\r\nimmediately on the boudoir of Fontainebleau. The interpanels\r\nand the panels of the walls and doors rival the beauty of those in\r\nthe room at South Kensington, and the comparison between the\r\nfirst and second in date of these two works, reveals in the choice\r\nand execution of the details a close resemblance which proclaims\r\nthat both are the creation of the same great craftsman. In both\r\n\r\n1 The decoration of one room, \"pilastres d\u00e9cor\u00e9s d'arabesques model\u00e9es en stuc, au\r\nmilieu desquelles se trouvaient de grands paysages style Hubert Robert,\" was bought,\r\nand, I think, recently sold by Mme. Lelong.",
  "128.png": "cases the architect, we must remember, was the same, but in the\r\nmore recent of the two decorations it is, in my opinion, perfectly\r\nclear that there is a more distinct intention to remain faithful to\r\nclassic tradition, and, in consequence, there is a certain loss of\r\ngrace and individuality. The general balance of effect is, in fact,\r\nless well kept in the ornament of the panels.\r\n\r\nWe are here in sight of the outset of that Style Empire which,\r\nhandled by the genius of a Prud'hon, lives with all the spontaneity\r\nof inspiration, but which, in the hands of men less well endowed,\r\nstiffens but too frequently into a cold and meagre elegance. To\r\nthis class belong the arabesques of the panels at Compi\u00e8gne, in\r\nthe old bedchamber of Marie-Antoinette. There we find again\r\nthe classic medallion, enframed in curves graceful enough in\r\nthemselves to charm the eye; but the effect obtained is merely\r\nagreeable, for the lightest accents in their drawing are softened\r\naway so that all character and breadth are lost, and we can already\r\ndetect the weakness of the later style imprisoned, as regards its\r\nultimate development, in a formal rigidity of line which does not\r\nalways find compensation in beauty and originality of detail.\r\nThere is, indeed, a tendency even to the multiplication of details,\r\nas may be observed in the interior decoration of the h\u00f4tel Crillon,\r\nentrusted to the architect P\u00e2ris by its first owner, the celebrated\r\nDuke d'Aumont;[1] but they become less and less choice, and during\r\nthis time that respect for the constructive intention which had\r\nbeen the soul of the Style Louis XV., and which continued if\r\nwith less authority to impose its rules over the Style Louis XVI.,\r\ndisappears entirely.\r\n\r\nIt is this respect for line that is the dominant quality of the\r\nboudoir of Mme. de S\u00e9rilly, and which, combined with the perfect\r\nexecution of the architectural detail, makes one forget the commonplace\r\nand futile character of certain subordinate parts of the painted\r\ndecoration. The ceiling is an admirable specimen of decorative\r\ndesign; the coloured circle is detached on the ground of a perfect\r\nsquare, the angles of which show four Austrian eagles--a tribute\r\nof respect on the part of the marquise for her royal mistress--and\r\nthe elaborate richness of the ornamental border in the arched\r\ncompartments opening on the cornice is enhanced by the simplicity\r\nof the consoles on which it rests; the usual acanthus leaf is replaced\r\nby sharp incisions, thanks to which the eye may rest before it is\r\ntaken by the garlands and projections of the frieze.\r\n\r\n1 In the wing of the second building on the Place de la Concorde, at the corner of\r\nthe rue Boissy-d'Anglas.

  "131.png": "\r\nThe style of the wall decoration is no less distinguished, and\r\nthe partial relief reserved for the urns and figures, that is to say\r\nfor the most important subjects of the decoration of each large\r\npanel, greatly enriches the general effect. The vigour of the\r\nimpression thus attained is further heightened and sustained by\r\nthe delicate work of the chisel in the beadings and mouldings\r\nwhich enframe the paintings. These mouldings define all the\r\narchitectural lines, and in this way I know nothing more\r\nbeautiful than the arrangement of the whole composition; even\r\nthe rather commonplace design adopted for the less important\r\nsections--scrolls of ivy and flowers--is atoned for by the way in\r\nwhich its application contributes to the general impression conveyed\r\nof a seductive harmony of colour.\r\n\r\nOne thing above all others gives to this little room especial\r\ndistinction, and that is the style of the chimney-piece. Whoever\r\nmay desire to point out the weakness of many elaborate decorations\r\nof this date cannot fail to remark the want of unity. This fault\r\nis evident in the delightful room at Fontainebleau, which in spite\r\nof its surpassing magnificence we need not hesitate to characterize\r\nas belonging to the same class as the S\u00e9rilly boudoir; it is\r\nimpossible to pick out there any dominant feature. The taste\r\nwhich has governed the decoration of the little chamber now\r\nreconstructed at South Kensington has imposed a totally different\r\ntreatment. Here we find but one unique beauty: a work of art\r\nof supreme excellence, shining like a jewel in its setting. The\r\neye passes with pleasure over the varied elegance which has left\r\nno space without its appropriate ornament; it returns invariably\r\nto the dominant feature, which is the very centre of the room.\r\nTo say that the mounts of the chimney-piece are certainly from\r\nthe hand of Gouthi\u00e8re, is to say that all the chaplets of beading\r\nhave the relief and beauty of pearls, that the sprays of foliage\r\napplied on the flat are chiselled as by a goldsmith at work on a\r\nclasp destined for a royal mantle, but on this occasion the art of\r\nGouthi\u00e8re serves but to give value to the sculptor's art, and to\r\nenhance the mysterious charm of the sheathed and veiled figures--representing\r\ntwo aged men--which have been sculpured[**sculptured] in gray\r\nmarble, on either side the fire-place, by the brilliant chisel of\r\nClodion. Involuntarily, one seeks to divine the forms hidden\r\nbeneath the draperies in which these figures are so admirably\r\nveiled. The breath of a secret source of life seems to inspire\r\nthem; a ghostly shadow falls across these witnesses of a vanished\r\npast. I do not know whether it is the effect produced by their\r\ncontrast with the surrounding expression of an art devoted to",
  "132.png": "the pleasures and amusements of life, but these veiled figures\r\nseem to have something of the pathetic sentiment which touches\r\nus in the \"pleureurs\" of the Tomb of Philippe le Hardi,\r\nand one may imagine that they weep, in like fashion, with as\r\nprofound emotion though with less na\u00efvet\u00e9, a life long vanished in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nIf, as I suppose, this room was decorated by de la Rotti\u00e8re in\r\n1781-2, some seven or eight years later than the date at which he\r\nwas engaged with his father and brother on the the \"Salon de la\r\nm\u00e9ridienne\" at Versailles[1] (1774); if we turn back to compare\r\nthe character of these works with that of his father's famous\r\ndecorations of the \"Cabinet du Conseil\" (1755), we shall at once\r\nrecognize the amazing change wrought within the short space of\r\nfive and twenty years. The style of the S\u00e9rilly boudoir, and\r\nits architectural treatment are closely allied to the admirable\r\ndecoration and design of the beautiful domed hall at Bagatelle\r\n(1780). One cannot suppose for a moment that de la Rotti\u00e8re was\r\nthere engaged by Bellanger: it is almost certain that that architect\r\nhad then already secured a co-operator in his brother-in-law, Jean-D\u00e9mosth\u00e8ne\r\nDugourc--but there is a certain similarity of character\r\nwhich suggests that the same type of excellence claimed the\r\nallegiance both of de la Rotti\u00e8re and Dugourc.\r\n\r\nWhen Bellanger built Bagatelle, the Style Pomp\u00e9ien was in its\r\npurest phase; in the little boudoir of Mme. de S\u00e9rilly, as in the\r\nmore brilliant boudoir of the Queen at Fontainebleau, it still maintains\r\nits wonderful charm marked by special excellence of detail, but\r\nit had degenerated somewhat before Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re (1787)\r\nwas called to the task of decorating the Salon of the rue Saint-Georges.\r\nIn this Salon, where one is amused to remember Barras\r\nhad probably many times received the visits of Jos\u00e9phine, certain\r\nportions--as, for example, the panels of the doors--are as fine as\r\nany work in the boudoir S\u00e9rilly, but there are also details--such\r\nas the ugly fringed sheet tied up with tassels and dotted with\r\nnails[2]--which tell unpleasantly against the finely designed wreaths\r\nof flowers accompanying the medallions above the doors and\r\nframing the central composition of Apollo and the Hours.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of any works of great importance such as these,\r\nJean-Sim\u00e9on had, it must be supposed, the assistance of his brother,\r\nJules-Hugues. It is perhaps a little point, but in this connection\r\nmay be worth noticing, that Jean-Sim\u00e9on, although he is described\r\n\r\n1 See chap, iii., p. 53.\r\n\r\n2 This imbecile detail was the \"rage\" just then, the \u00e9b\u00e9nistes repeated it ad\r\nnauseam.

His influence--even if it were not so great as he\r\nwould have us believe--was a thing to be reckoned with\r\nby all those who during the later years of the century devoted\r\nthemselves to decorative design.

She undoubtedly\r\npossessed a sincere and instinctive love of art, and sought the signs\r\nof perfection and distinction in all that was executed for her rather\r\nthan the satisfaction of mere personal luxury. Louis XV. had to\r\nbe amused. \"La marquise et ses amis disent,\" writes d'Argenson\r\non the 10th September, 1752, \"qu'on ne peut amuser le Roi\r\nabsolument que de dessins d'architecture, que S.M. ne respire qu'avec\r\ndes plans et des dessins sur sa table, ce qui ruine les finances.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe taste of the marquise at least secured for France some\r\ncompensation for the extravagance of her king. Her encouragement\r\nof the manufactory of S\u00e8vres,[3] her relations to Guay, the\r\n\"graveur en pierres fines\";[4] her own attempts to acquire some\r\npractical knowledge of his delicate art; her choice of the men\r\nwho accompanied her brother to Italy, are all facts which show\r\nthat her mind remained constantly open to serious considerations.\r\n\r\nThat quality in her nature which led her to reject all but the\r\nmost perfect and distinguished work, coupled with her definite\r\napprehensions of style enabled her, during the twenty years of her\r\n\r\n1 Though it is an old and familiar story, it may be as well to recall at this point the\r\nfact that the rediscovery of Herculaneum and Pompeii (circa 1750) stimulated this\r\nreaction, that it was confirmed by the publication of Winckelmann's \"Le Antichita\r\ndi Ercolano,\" and further popularized by the appearance of Le Roy's \"Les plus\r\nbeaux monuments de la Gr\u00e8ce.\"\r\n\r\n2 D'Argenson, \"M\u00e9moires,\" t. vii., p. 299.\r\n\r\n3 See Delaborde, \"De l'Union des Arts et de l'Industrie.\" Garnier, \"La porcelaine\r\ntendre de S\u00e8vres.\" R.

Marie-Antoinette was\r\nno more capable than Madame Dubarry of supplying that test of\r\nexcellence which had been found in the personal predilections,\r\naccomplished taste and sagacious judgment of Mme. de Pompadour.\r\nWith the later years of Louis XV. the conflict of varying\r\ntendencies--set free by the disappearance of any central control--grew\r\nmore and more bewildering, and it is not surprising to find\r\nthat Dugourc, on his return to Paris from Rome, after the death of\r\nhis mother, hesitated as to the choice of a career.[2]\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely necessary that he should earn his bread, for\r\nhis father's fortune, which he represents as having been considerable,\r\nhad vanished in the expenses of a protracted law-suit.\r\n\"D'amateur qu'il \u00e9toit, Dugourc devint artiste,\" but his situation\r\nmust have been precarious, and if he were concerned with any\r\nwork for the Dauphine it can have been neither fixed nor important.\r\nDugourc, therefore, again left Paris: on this occasion he\r\nwent to Valenciennes on the invitation of the governor, M. de\r\nGribeauval,[3] \"inspecteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'artillerie,\" who, he says, \"l'as-*\r\n\r\n1 \"C'est en elle,\" writes M.

  "142.png": "He held the post of \"Sculpteur de son Altesse royale,\" which\r\nwould have protected him in the exercise of his art even if he had\r\nnot been an active official of the Academy of St. Luke, to whose\r\nSalon, in 1774, he had sent two bas-reliefs and a series of twelve\r\ndesigns of ornament \"grav\u00e9s dans la mani\u00e8re du crayon rouge et\r\nnoir par Mlle. Liottier la jeune, belle-fille et \u00e9l\u00e8ve de l'auteur.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe advantage derived by Dugourc from having been brought\r\ninto touch with Cauvet, under the direction of Bellanger, at the\r\noutset of his official career, was incalculable. Cauvet also\r\n\"s'antousiasma de l'Antiquit\u00e9.\" Many series of his designs are\r\npurely pompe\u00efan in character--hanging medallions are supported\r\nby terms and nymphs drawn with great elegance, and sometimes\r\nwith not unintentional reminiscence of the Loggie of Raphael.\r\nThere are also frequent proofs to be found in his \"Recueil\" of\r\nhis classic studies, such, for example, as the acanthus ornament, on\r\nplate 47[2]--which reminds us that he exhibited \"un bas relief de\r\nl'origine du chapiteau Corinthien\"[3]--or the bit of the Arch of\r\nTitus, which he has reproduced with a care which shows how deep\r\nwas his feeling for certain refinements of style.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the case of Cauvet, as in that of Dugourc,\r\nthere is hardly any work positively identified as carried out from\r\nhis designs.[4] The fact that he is known to have mounted four\r\ntables of petrified wood for Marie-Antoinette[5] at the Petit\r\nTrianon has given colour to the suggestion that he was employed\r\nby the Court elsewhere, but the accounts of the Board of Works\r\nare missing after 1774--that is to say, for the whole of the period\r\nin which one would look for the entry of Cauvet's name. One\r\nof the drawings of his \"Recueil\" (plate 22) may, I think, be\r\nrecognized in the frieze at Versailles, which decorates the \"Cabinet\r\ndes Chiens,\" the subject and main lines of which recall the\r\n\r\n1 Guiffrey, \"Expositions de l'Acad\u00e9mie de St. Luc,\" p. 165. Mlle. Liottier\r\ndoes not engrave after Cauvet so well as Leroy, or Martini, whom he also employed.\r\n\r\n2 I must acknowledge the advantage I have had in working with the remarkable\r\ncollection of the published works of Cauvet and other designers, bequeathed by\r\nM. Lessousfach\u00e9 to the library of the Ecole des Beaux Arts.\r\n\r\n3 No. 215, Salon 1774. Cauvet was living at this date, as in 1777, in the rue de\r\nS\u00e8ve. In 1776, the address of \"L'Eveill\u00e9, tr\u00e8s-habile artiste\" is given in the\r\nAlmanach historique as \"rue de S\u00e8ve, maison de M. Cauvet, sculpteur.\" See Davillier,\r\n\"Cabinet du duc d'Aumont,\" p. xxvii.\r\n\r\n4 The various ornamentation of the \"d\u00e9coration de boudoir,\" exhibited in 1888\r\nby Mme. Lelong, was attributed to Cauvet, and his drawings are said to have been\r\nrecognized in the \"Salon\" of the old H\u00f4tel de Noailles-Mouchy (reproduced by de\r\nChampeaux, \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif,\" p. 80) which was destroyed in making the Boulevard\r\nSt. Germain.\r\n\r\n5 She seems to have had a passion for this natural curiosity.

  "143.png": "famous work by Van Cl\u00e8ve[1] in the Salon de l'\u0152il de B\u0153uf. The\r\ndrawing of the \"Recueil\"--which has served as the basis for the\r\nbeautiful decoration now but ill seen in the Cabinet des Chiens--though\r\nevidently inspired by the work of Van Cl\u00e8ve, is treated\r\nwith a more fanciful elegance in the arrangement of the fantastic\r\ndogs and children whom Cauvet has represented in the embrace of\r\nthe sinuous curves and delicate tendrils of a gracefully foliated\r\narabesque.\r\n\r\nThis work was most probably executed before the publication,\r\nin 1777, of the \"Recueil\" in which it is represented, and therefore\r\nbefore the date at which we know that Dugourc, as well as\r\nCauvet, was employed by Monsieur. There are, however, some traces\r\nof Dugourc's favour with Marie-Antoinette before he was brought\r\ndirectly under her notice by his direction of the f\u00eates at Brunoy, and\r\nthere are indications that he was possibly in early and friendly relations\r\nwith her favourite, Richard Mique, in whose interest she had\r\nforced the hand of Gabriel, and destroyed the valuable direction\r\ngiven by the authority of the First Architect to the Crown.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the autobiography to which I have already referred will be\r\nfound the statement that Dugourc had hesitated to accept the post\r\nof \"Inspecteur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des manufactures de France,\" which had\r\nbeen offered to him, because he would have preferred that of\r\n\"Directeur particulier des B\u00e2timents du Roi, Jardins, Arts et\r\nManufactures Royales, que la Reine voulait faire cr\u00e9er en sa\r\nfaveur pour soulager d'une partie du travail du D\u00e9partement M.\r\nd'Angiviller, qui en \u00e9toit Ordonnateur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe date of the offer is easily fixed, for this apparently simple\r\nstatement, in the autobiography of Dugourc, reveals the last\r\ndevelopment of the intrigues set on foot by Marie-Antoinette to\r\nrelieve herself from the necessity of submitting to d'Angiviller the\r\nestimates for her incessantly altered and always costly projects. She\r\nwished to spend as much money as she chose without having to ask\r\nfor it. \"M. l'abb\u00e9 de Vermond,\" writes Mique as early as 1777--after\r\na troubled time as \"Intendant et Contr\u00f4leur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des b\u00e2timents\r\nde la Reine\"--\"en m'apprenant que la Reine s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9e \u00e0\r\nremettre Trianon aux b\u00e2timents, m'ajouta que S.

  "144.png": "Gustavus III. of Sweden applied to him for the designs both as to\r\ncostume and decoration for six operas (1781), and the Grand duke\r\nPaul vainly endeavoured to induce him to leave France for Russia.\r\nHe refused the great offers then made to him, so he explains, on\r\naccount of his recent marriage, but it is clear that his situation in\r\nParis left him nothing to desire. The millionaires of that day,\r\nLaborde, \"banquier de la Cour,\" and Saint-James, \"Tr\u00e9sorier de\r\nla Marine,\" placed in his hands the building of their country\r\nhouses and the laying out of vast English gardens,[1] and \" Mylord\r\nSchelburnn, l'un des membres les plus distingu\u00e9s du Parlement\r\nd'Angleterre\" received from Dugourc the plans for a most magnificent\r\nmuseum.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Queen atoned for her failure to create for him a more\r\nimportant post, by the appointment of Dugourc, in 1784, as\r\n\"Dessinateur du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne,\" a situation\r\nwhich he held conjointly with his place of \"Intendant des\r\nb\u00e2timents de Monsieur.\" These two offices--taken in connection\r\nwith his control (1783) of the costumes and decorations of the\r\nOpera--enabled him to exercise immense power over the latest\r\ndevelopments of the \"Style Louis XVI.\" In his own words, \"tout\r\nce qui s'est fait \u00e0 Paris de pr\u00e9cieux et de recherch\u00e9 pendant cet\r\nespace de temps a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit par lui et soumis \u00e0 son examen.\"\r\n\r\nWriting of the \"grand salon \u00e0 coupole\" at Bagatelle, M. de\r\nChampeaux says, \"cette pi\u00e8ce d'un beau caract\u00e8re fait honneur au\r\ntalent d\u00e9corateur de Bellanger,\"[3] but we may take the treatment of\r\nthis fine salon, I think, as the earliest example of the work carried\r\nout by Dugourc in conjunction with his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nBellanger was, of course, no mean artist himself in respect of\r\ndecoration, as the interesting series of his designs preserved at the\r\nCabinet des Estampes, to which I have previously had occasion to\r\n\r\nof the unwillingness of the King to indulge the reckless expenditure at the Petit\r\nTrianon for the English garden, in the Queen's refusal to ask for the money, as\r\nd'Angiviller entreated her to do, and in her insistence that he should himself carry\r\nthrough the negociation.\r\n\r\n1 Those for Saint-James cost \"quatre millions.\" \"La Vie parisienne sous\r\nLouis XVI.,\" p. 36.\r\n\r\n2 These plans seem to have been lost. Search has been made for them at Bowood;\r\nbut I learn, from inquiries made for me there by Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, that\r\namongst those preserved, \"a very miscellaneous lot, are gates, terraces, baths, furniture,\r\ntemples, and grottoes, some of French design, but nothing which looks at all like any\r\npart of a museum, and no trace of Dugourc's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans le vieux Paris,\" p. 305. M. de Champeaux adds that\r\nLord Hertford did not care for boiseries sculpt\u00e9es[** sculpt\u00e8es?]. A few years before his death he\r\nsold a great quantity for small sums to dealers, amongst others a complete \"salon avec\r\nses pilastres et ses plafonds de l'\u00e9poque de Louis XVI.\" A description of Bagatelle\r\nin 1787 will be found in \"La Vie parisienne sous Louis XVI.,\" p. 31.",

  "147.png": "refer, goes far to show.[1] Not the least interesting amongst these\r\nare those concerned with the interior decoration and arrangement\r\nof Bagatelle, and not the least graceful amongst these last is the\r\ncentre design for a ceiling in which we find a suggestive detail--a\r\nstrongly and beautifully designed peacock with crest erect and\r\ntail outspread. It is a marked feature of which I do not feel sure\r\nthat Bellanger should have the credit; perhaps, indeed, we should\r\nconnect its introduction with the hand of Dugourc, for we find\r\nthis same delightful peacock strutting on the panels of the \"Petit\r\ncabinet de la Reine\" at Versailles.\r\n\r\nIt is but a slight clue, but it confirms a conjecture hazarded by\r\nM. Dussieux, who mentions the name of Dugourc amongst those\r\nwho were possibly responsible for the direction of the decoration\r\nin the apartments of the Dauphine.[2] There can here, however,\r\nbe no question of Bellanger, and if--as I am inclined to suppose--Dugourc\r\nhad some hand in the work executed in the \"petit\r\ncabinet,\" on the door of which appear \"appliques en cuivre\r\ncisel\u00e9s par Gouthi\u00e8re,\" it must have been as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of\r\nMique.\r\n\r\nUntil the retirement of Jacques-Ange Gabriel, Mique--though\r\nhe may have called in Dugourc upon occasion--had not\r\npower enough to give him anything like permanent employment.\r\nHe himself had succeeded Emmanuel Her\u00e9 as \"Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\r\ndes b\u00e2timents\" to the King of Poland at Nancy, and had petitioned\r\nMarigny (February, 1766), on the death of Stanislas, to continue\r\nhis salary and leave him in charge of the buildings which the\r\nKing had erected in Lorraine. Across this letter Marigny wrote,\r\n\"a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'on n'y ferait point de r\u00e9ponse,\"[3] but Mique, undismayed,\r\nreturned to the charge and must be supposed--for here\r\ndocuments fail us--to have produced some effect, since he makes\r\nhis appearance in the town of Versailles in the following year.\r\nWhilst engaged there on the buildings of the Convent of the\r\nChanoinesses Ursulines (now, I think, the Lyc\u00e9e), he must have\r\ncontrived to obtain the good graces of the Dauphine, for on the\r\ninstant of her accession the name of Mique was placed on the list\r\nof her Household as \"Intendant et contr\u00f4leur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des b\u00e2timents\r\n\r\n1 I will cite here as specially noticeable a \"chemin\u00e9e de granit rose des Vosges\r\npour une chambre \u00e0 coucher ... dans la maison Peregaux. Elle est dispos\u00e9e sur\r\nles nouveaux principes de Caminologie contre les inconvenients de la fum\u00e9e et les\r\ndangers du feu.\" In what way these principles affected the arrangement we are not\r\ntold, but we see that Bellanger had a fine sense of colour.\r\n\r\n2 \"Le ch\u00e2teau de Versailles,\" t. ii., pp. 2 and 3.

They were employed at Fontainebleau, in\r\nthe \"Chambre du roi\" about 1767, for d'Argenville, writing in\r\n1768, says, \"le plafond vient d'\u00eatre redor\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rens[**typo diff\u00e9rents?; archaic spelling? P2]] ors sur un\r\nfond blanc,\"[2] but, perhaps, the earliest examples of their use at\r\nVersailles are to be found in the \"salle des bains\" of Louis XV.\r\n(1770),[3] the panels of which are full gilt, and framed in a border\r\nof rushes tinted in greenish gold. Similar treatment may be\r\nobserved in such parts of what is called the \"appartement de\r\nMme. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde,\" as were carried out in 1775, but in the decorations\r\nof the \"petits appartements de la Reine\" there appear new\r\nelements which were very possibly due to the collaboration of\r\nDugourc.\r\n\r\nThe dolphin which accompanies the Austrian eagle in the\r\nmetal ornaments of the door shows that the work was executed\r\nbefore 1774, but the most conspicuous ornament on the panels is\r\nthe peacock treated exactly as we find it in the designs for Bagatelle.\r\nThe subsidiary decoration--the vase forms on the interpanels,\r\nthe sheafs of arrows and volutes of trailing rose-branches--is of a\r\ncharacter corresponding precisely with that applied under Mique's\r\ndirection to the \"Boudoir\" of the Queen at the Petit Trianon.[4]\r\nWhen first arranging this little room Mique introduced the ingenious\r\ndevice by which the windows were masked at night by\r\nmirrors,[5] but the old wainscot was retained. The later work\r\nwhich we now see--the pattern threading its way along the\r\nborder line and having the panel free[6]--dates only from 1787\r\n\r\n1 N. A., 1872, p. 94.

A.\r\n\r\nIf this work were inspired by Dugourc, then we must infer\r\nthat he had lost ground since he published, in 1782, the fine set\r\nof six arabesques which he signed with the monogram \"D. G.\"[2]\r\nGraceful as the work is, it conveys an irresistible impression of\r\npettiness: as one passes from the old rooms, which still keep\r\nsomething of a royal air, into this boudoir we get a sense of\r\ndiminution. We mentally compare the dainty elegance of these\r\narabesques with the splendid breadth of style which distinguishes\r\nthe achievements of Verberckt and Rousseau, and again we recognize\r\nhow rapidly the feeling for noble line is passing away.\r\n\r\nYet, whilst the general style lost breadth and nobility, the\r\nexecution of every detail reached unsurpassed perfection. There\r\nare fragments of the metal mounts in the \"Garde-robe de Louis\r\nXVI.\" (1788),[3] which are of matchless finish. Delicacy of execution\r\nis carried to a point in the marble mantelpiece which is\r\nrivalled only by the workmanship of the gilt fittings. Little\r\nchiselled wreaths, little rosettes on the lock of the door, might be\r\nmeant as jewels for a queen's gown, and are wrought with the skill\r\nof a goldsmith. I have thought, in touching some of them, of the\r\ngrains of gold laid between the lines of fine Greek work.\r\n\r\nUnlike Mique, who, together with his son, followed his royal\r\n\r\n1 \"Vie parisienne sous Louis XVI.,\" p. 83.\r\n\r\n2 Renouvier, \"Histoire de l'Art pendant la R\u00e9volution,\" classes Dugourc amongst\r\n\"Graveurs sur bois.\" There is a set of these arabesques in the Print Room of the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n3 See p. 53.",

He even took\r\ncredit to himself for the prudent selfishness by which his conduct\r\nat this critical moment was governed. \"Fermement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 ne\r\njouer aucun r\u00f4le dans l'\u00e9trange \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui bouleversait sa patrie,\r\nDugourc se tourna,\" he says, \"vers les manufactures.\"\r\n\r\nThe making of coloured papers by means of stencilled patterns\r\nand block prints coloured by hand after the fashion of early wood-engravings\r\nhad always remained in the hands of the same workmen--\"dominotiers,[1]\r\nimagers et tapissiers.\" For a long while their\r\nuse had been confined to the covering and lining of books and\r\nboxes and the decoration of very small rooms. With the later\r\nyears of the reign of Louis XVI. their popularity had extended,\r\nand Dugourc seized the opportunity to establish, with Anisson-Dup\u00e9ron,\r\nthe \"Directeur de l'Imprimerie Royale,\" a manufacture\r\nof \"papier peints,\" which he declares became within the year,\r\nthanks to his exertions, the rival of the two most famous then\r\nexisting in Paris.[2] \"La condanation d'Anisson,\" who appears to\r\nhave been less prudent than his colleague, destroyed this flourishing\r\nenterprise, and Dugourc turned his attention to other projects. He\r\nstarted a factory for the issue of Republican playing cards, and\r\nanother for the imitation of English glass, giving at the same time\r\nconstant care to one of the best porcelain manufactories in Paris,[3]\r\n\"celle de S\u00e8ve \u00e9tant alors totallement paralys\u00e9e.\"\r\n\r\nOf Dugourc's power as a designer and manufacturer, whether\r\nof paper-hangings or of glass and porcelain, we have, I believe, no\r\nauthentic example; there is, however, no doubt that he applied to\r\nevery form of decoration those brilliantly and forcibly designed\r\narabesques by which his reputation is best distinguished. As to\r\nhis playing cards, the case is different, for, in addition to the famous\r\nset of the \"nouvelles cartes de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise,\" which--though\r\ncoarsely coloured--have been actually attributed to David\r\non account of the solid qualities of draughtsmanship by which they\r\nare characterized,[4] Dugourc has signed various other small works at\r\n\r\n1 \"Dominotiers\" from \"dominos,\" that is to say, marbled papers or papers ornamented\r\nby \"Grotesques.\" Renouvier, \"L'Art pendant la R\u00e9volution,\" t. ii., p. 375.\r\n\r\n2 It was located in the ci-devant H\u00f4tel Longueville, Place du Carrousel.\r\n\"Hist. de la Soc.

He\r\ncould not, therefore put aside the call to Madrid, and at Madrid\r\non the 26th April, 1800, he wrote the curious Memoir, which--if\r\nwe except the tradition preserved by Brulliart by which he is\r\nassigned to St. Aubin as a pupil in his early days--is our only\r\nsource of information concerning his life and work. These are\r\ninteresting in no ordinary degree, not only because Dugourc represents\r\nbetter than any other man, specially occupied with\r\ndecorative design, the modifications which characterized the epoch\r\nof Louis XVI. and his Queen, but because his art lived at its best\r\nand even grew in the hour of Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe work of Cuvilli\u00e8s,[2] for example, is typically representative\r\nof the \"Style R\u00e9gence\"; that of Delafosse and Delalonde reflects\r\n\r\ntwo bear \"Dugourc inv., l'an 11 de la R\u00e9publique par brevet d'invention,\" others\r\n\"Par brevet d'Invention Jaume et Dugourc.\" Jaume is said to have been responsible\r\nfor the colour.\r\n\r\n1 Renouvier, t. ii., pp. 378-381.\r\n\r\n2 Biais, \"Les Pineau,\" p. 28 note.

In 1777 he lived in\r\nthe rue Neuve-Saint-Martin (Destailleurs, \"L'Ornementation des Appartements,\"\r\nt. i., p. 84).

Dugourc\r\nseems to have been an exception. He had anticipated the delivery\r\nof the classic gospel: the temper of his work remained unchanged,\r\nnay more, it became excellently genial in the heat and fervour of\r\nthe common appeal to the ideals of that life by which his own art\r\nhad been inspired.\r\n\r\nDugourc was no mere arch\u00e6ologist, and the proof of the exceptional\r\ncharacter of his sentiment for classic models is to be found\r\nin the fact that work designed by him has been actually attributed\r\nto Prud'hon. No finer test could be imagined. In the h\u00f4tel of\r\nMlle. d'Hervieu, the dancer, who became the second wife of his\r\nbrother-in-law Bellanger, was once to be found the chef-d'\u0153uvre\r\nof that architect's work with Dugourc. The dining-rooms, bathrooms,\r\nand boudoirs of the h\u00f4tel, which was built by Brongniart in\r\n1774, were constructed by Bellanger in 1789 and, on their completion,\r\nthe building--which stood in the rue de la Victoire--was\r\nfigured amongst \"Les plus belles maisons de Paris\" by Krafft and\r\nRansonette. It has, of course, been destroyed,[1] but some door\r\npanels from the interior decoration enriched with arabesques and\r\nallegorical medallions have been preserved in the collection of\r\nM. H. de Grefulhe, and it is a deserved tribute to the remarkable\r\ntalent of Dugourc that these panels, when they were reproduced\r\nby M. Gueullette in the Gazette des Beaux Arts, should have been\r\ndescribed as painted by Prud'hon.\r\n\r\nAs an artist, Dugourc claims a place apart: his qualities of\r\nnatural gift and the character of his intelligence recall another man\r\nof even greater value. He was certainly as braggart if not as\r\nbrutal as Cellini, but he possessed a cooler head and was too cautious\r\nto betray his interests by any insolent self-assertion in high places.\r\nBorn of wealthy parents, at the very gates of a royal palace, and in\r\nconstant familiarity with the great, his stay at Madrid in 1800,\r\nshows that he had known how to preserve, throughout the days of\r\nthe Revolution, as much consideration with Courts as when, nearly\r\ntwenty years earlier, he had planned a palace for Catharine II.[2]\r\n\r\n1 De Champeaux \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans le Vieux Paris,\" p. 318.

Mirrors or picture panels such\r\nas those executed by Watteau for the dining-room of\r\nCrozat, were, as we have seen, constantly employed in combination\r\nwith the carven \"boiserie,\" the painted panels serving, as the\r\nEmpress Maria-Theresa remarked, when she sent her daughter\r\nthe pictures still hanging at the Petit Trianon, in the place of\r\n\"tapisserie attach\u00e9e \u00e0 la muraille.\" Such treatment was, however,\r\nnot pliant enough for the decoration of the little rooms, the\r\ncabinets, the boudoirs, which were the delight of \"un monde\r\nfol\u00e2tre o\u00f9 chacun cherchait \u00e0 tout faire marcher de front--l'amour,\r\nles arts, la bonne ch\u00e8re, la galanterie.\" The growing passion for\r\nthese tiny \"r\u00e9duits\" naturally created for its satisfaction special\r\nvarieties of art.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of their ornamentation is usually to be found in\r\nthe incorporation of little medallion pictures with a general decoration\r\nworked out by arabesques, scrolls, garlands of flowers and\r\nother accompanying ornament, sometimes painted, sometimes in\r\nrelief. Daniel Marot had inserted pictorial subjects in a heavy\r\nframework of ornament. Jean Berain had dismissed the picture and\r\nrelied wholly on the amusing character of his arabesque designs,\r\nthe curves of which he filled with detached figures:--satyrs,\r\nchildren, apes, treated in a frolic spirit and besprinkled with flowers,\r\nbirds and insects. These two schemes are united, harmonized and\r\nendowed with new character and life by his successors. In the orna-*",

The h\u00f4tel of this lady,\r\nwhose facile morals and devotion to every kind of pleasure gained\r\nfor her the title of \"La Dame de la Volupt\u00e9,\" is now the military\r\nprison of the rue Cherche-midi, with the name of which the\r\nDreyfus case has made us familiar, and access to the pavilion can\r\nonly be obtained by way of the rue d'Assas. The interior has\r\nbeen stripped of its ancient magnificence, but a finely carved dessus\r\nde porte in the style of Verberckt is conspicuous above the door\r\nleading to the boudoir, the ceiling of which alone bears witness\r\nto the former glories of the house.\r\n\r\nThis ceiling is of an oval shape, and is covered with arabesques,\r\non a white ground, which connect two small medallions of landscape\r\nsubject placed at opposite ends. Beneath these medallions\r\nappear squirrels with tails so long and bushy that they might be\r\ntaken for foxes, and over the whole field are distributed apes\r\nplaying every sort of monkey trick in the company of very delicately\r\ndrawn specimens of the strange birds which then went by\r\nthe name of \"oiseaux de la Chine.\" All this various detail is\r\nheld together by graceful garlands of flowers, but their charms are\r\nwholly eclipsed by the remarkable beauty of the frieze in gilt relief\r\nby which the ceiling is bordered. Here we have a series of the\r\nsports of savage men and monkeys who are hunting strange birds\r\nequipped with dragon's tails, these tails being inextricably entwined\r\nwith the curves of the arabesques and foliage by which the groups\r\nare connected.\r\n\r\nThe sculpturesque character of this work, its energy and delicacy\r\nsuggest the hand of a master, and M. de Champeaux, who\r\nnotes that the style is not that of Huet, goes as far as to mention\r\nWatteau himself,[3] to whom he has also attributed a \"plafond\" of\r\na marvellous lightness of execution in the H\u00f4tel de Poulpry.[4]\r\n\r\n1 No. 133, 273.

When Oudry\r\npainted rooms at Vaur\u00e9 and Fontenay-aux-Roses for his patron\r\nFagon, in both places the \"fond blanc\" makes its appearance. In\r\nthe \"Grand Salon\" at Vaur\u00e9, arabesques were mingled with birds\r\nand flowers: at Fontenay, where there were several Salons to\r\ndecorate, landscape, flowers, birds, and various beasts were introduced,\r\nand the ground again was white. The same scheme served\r\nfor the \"Salle de l'appartement des bains\" at Sceaux, where he\r\npainted plants and flowers \"le tout sur des fonds blancs.\" Of\r\nother work by Oudry, carried out for his friend Mass\u00e9, the famous\r\nminiature painter,[3] in 1725, we hear that it formed part of a ceiling,\r\nthe greater part of which had been executed by Claude Audran.\r\nThe plan of Audran's composition, which was strictly followed by\r\nOudry, showed in the centre \"une corbeille ovale et sur la plinthe,\r\nquatre oiseaux de Chine et huit singes v\u00eatus artistement, repr\u00e9sentant\r\ndes actions comiques,\"[4] and this decoration--which recalls\r\nthe apes and birds on the ceiling of the room painted for the\r\nCountess de Verrue--was, in like fashion, carried out on a white\r\n\r\nde porte: le Faune et l'Enj\u00f4leur, retrouv\u00e9s par M. le Comte de la B\u00e9raudi\u00e8re dans\r\nl'h\u00f4tel de Poulpry, situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s du quai d'Orsay dans la rue de Poitiers, ainsi qu'un\r\npanneau de fleurs et un plafond d'arabesques ayant la m\u00eame origine et appartenant \u00e0\r\nM.

Fraisse--one of\r\nthe painters of the Household of the Prince de Cond\u00e9--who was\r\nlodged at Chantilly, brought together there a collection of Chinese\r\nand Japanese drawings, of stuffs, and of Indian and Persian prints,\r\nwhich he utilized by the publication, in 1735, of a \"Livre de\r\ndessins Chinois,\"[2] which at once became a favourite source of\r\ninspiration to the painters of grotesques.\r\n\r\nHuet himself brought out a lively and amusing series of\r\n\"Singeries, ou diff\u00e9rentes actions de la vie humaine,\"[3] from which\r\nsome idea may be gained of the frolicsome spirit in which he\r\nhandled the apish actors whom, costumed \u00e0 la Chinoise, he placed\r\nin possession of the field at Chantilly. The date of the execution\r\nof both the \"Grande\" and \"Petite Singerie\" is far from certain,\r\nand the first mention of their existence is, I think, to be found in\r\nd'Argenville, who, writing nearly ten years after Huet's death,\r\nnotes the existence in the ch\u00e2teau of two works of this class.\r\nAfter describing the Salon \"en forme de galerie,\" he adds, \"il y a\r\nde plus dans une tour un cabinet peint dans le go\u00fbt de la Chine,\"\r\nand further on he mentions, as on the ground floor, \"un salon\r\ncarr\u00e9 et dor\u00e9, dont les panneaux sont verts, dans le go\u00fbt Chinois,\r\nsur un fond jonquille.\"[4]\r\n\r\n1 Mathieu Marais, M\u00e9m., t. ii., pp. 67, 73, 77, 81, 89, and Saint-Simon, vol. xi.,\r\np. 379.\r\n\r\n2 A.

The de Goncourt\r\naccepted both works as from the hand of no less a master\r\nthan Watteau himself. Writing of the \"Grande Singerie,\"\r\nEdmond de Goncourt says \"partout pour moi rayonne doucement\r\nla signature de Watteau, dans ces ornements qui reviennent sans\r\ncesse, dans ces rosaces, ces nimbes faits des ailes membraneuses et\r\nduveteuses de phal\u00e8nes, dans ces d\u00e9chiquetures aux nuances assoupies\r\ndes papillons de la nuit.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe italics in the above sentence are mine, for, to be just, one\r\nmust admit that this detail is especially likely to bias anyone at first\r\nsight in favour of the attribution to Watteau. It is an invention\r\nof his which appears first, I think, in the centre of the upper\r\narabesque enframing the \"D\u00e9nicheur de moineaux,\" and I can\r\nunderstand the irresistible temptation to recognize these fantastic\r\nmoth-wings as the signature of Watteau, and, relying on their\r\ntestimony--not wholly unsupported by other signs of resemblance to\r\ndesigns from his hand--to hail both the \"Singeries\" of Chantilly as\r\n\"un ensemble de peintures encore toutes fra\u00eeches, et qui peut faire\r\njuger dans ce genre la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 et l'esprit du pinceau du ma\u00eetre.\"\r\n\r\nEdmond de Goncourt was, notwithstanding his natural prejudice\r\nin favour of this work, too clear-sighted to pass over the\r\nproofs that, even if Watteau had supplied the design for the decoration,\r\nit was certainly not the work of his hands; \"il faut\r\nl'avouer,\" he continues, \"il y a quelques in\u00e9galit\u00e9s, et les amours\r\net les enfants sont dessin\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re assez baroque.\"[2] In the\r\nabsence of any positive evidence in favour of this attribution all\r\none can say is, that whilst it is not impossible, only unlikely,\r\nthat the general scheme of the decoration was suggested by Watteau,\r\nit is most probable that the whole work is by Christophe Huet,\r\nwho adapted from the master's published designs ornamental details\r\nwhich happened to suit his purpose.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, the name of Watteau has left no trace in\r\nthe accounts of the house of Cond\u00e9, whereas, under the date 1741,\r\nthere still exists the \"M\u00e9moire r\u00e9gl\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Huet peintre, sur la\r\nsuccession de Mademoiselle de Clermont.\"[3] Something, too, may\r\nbe made of the marked likeness between the decorations at Chantilly\r\n\r\n1 \"Cat. de Gt.,\" p. 198.\r\n\r\n2 \"Cat. de Gt.,\" pp. 197 and 199.\r\n\r\n3 A.

  "170.png": "and those executed by Huet for the Regent, which is suggested by\r\nthe description of the Salon at Bagnolet given by Piganiol de la\r\nForce. The room is covered, he says, with very excellent paintings\r\n\"formant dans chaque panneau, de petits tableaux, o\u00f9 l'on voit\r\ndes jeux de Chinois avec des paysages tr\u00e8s l\u00e9gers, enferm\u00e9s dans\r\ndes ornements de guirlandes de fleurs.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAs one reads these words it is impossible not to recall the\r\ngarlands and sprays of flowers realistically treated which are introduced\r\non the shutters of the windows and other subordinate parts\r\nof the decoration in the \"Grande Singerie\" at Chantilly. Accompanying\r\nthe delicate landscapes, which form a background to the\r\nrustic games figuring on the panels of the Cabinet at the H\u00f4tel de\r\nRohan, we find the same mixture of natural forms and highly conventional\r\nornament by which, as at Chantilly, Huet seems to have\r\nanticipated that movement of taste which gained in strength till\r\nafter the days of the Revolution. Even the garlands of flowers\r\nemployed by Boucher in the little Salon decorated by him for\r\nMme. de Pompadour at the ch\u00e2teau de Cr\u00e9cy are treated in a far\r\nless realistic style than Huet ventured to adopt.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the reference to the designs of Watteau,\r\nwhich are an undoubted feature of the \"Grande Singerie,\" was\r\nimposed by the fancy of Mlle. de Clermont herself, but it is\r\nevident from the style of the landscapes in the H\u00f4tel de Rohan\r\nthat no prompting was wanted to induce Huet to consult the\r\nwork of the master.[2] It is in the gaiety of his actors, in the gracile\r\nelegance of his birds and beasts, and in the beauty of his flowers\r\nthat we find his special character and charm. Myriad are the\r\nbrilliant forms of life which cover the panels of the walls, the\r\nmouldings of the doors, the cornice of the ceiling, where the\r\nmoth-wings make a central rosette upon the white ground.\r\n\r\nNo very consistent method has dictated the choice of the\r\nsubjects in which apes follow to the war a \"porte-drapeau de\r\nl'infanterie de Cond\u00e9,\" go out hunting in the Prince's livery; escort\r\na Chinaman in his palanquin or serenade him whilst he drinks his\r\ntea. In some cases the parts are reversed, and little Chinese find\r\ncourage sufficient to pay their court to an elderly guenon, or watch\r\nthe prowess of the monkeys who, armed with guns, pursue the\r\ntimid doe or bristly wild boar along the ceiling.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Bonbonni\u00e8re,\" a little room on the ground floor close\r\n\r\n1 See \"Descrip. hist. de la Ville de Paris et de ses environs.\"\r\n\r\n2 I think that there is no example of decoration in which landscape is brought into\r\nsuch perfectly admirable relations with ornament as that afforded by Huet's work at\r\nthe H\u00f4tel de Rohan.",

  "173.png": "to the private apartments of the late Duke d'Aumale, is to be found\r\nthe \"Petite Singerie,\" which my friend M. Gruyer considers\r\n\"moins fine et moins spirituelle\" than the \"Grande.\" Perhaps\r\nthat is so; but at the same time I must confess that it lives in my\r\nmemory as having a more personal accent. The series of absurd\r\nscenes in which monkeys are here made to satirize the follies and\r\nvices of the \"smart\" world of that day are of sarcasm so scathing\r\nthat one can even credit the legend that Huet was giving a lesson\r\nby command to the capricious mistress of \"M. le duc,\" Mme. de\r\nPrie. Except, however, in a single instance where women are\r\nintroduced sledging with runners in the Cond\u00e9 livery, there is no\r\nhint of personal caricature--for the rest we find merely the affectations\r\nand occupations common to the class which made a figure in\r\nthe \"extr\u00eame d\u00e9bordement de cette cour.\" The apes bathe, they\r\ndress and ride, they play at enjoying rustic pleasures, and finish the\r\nday as fine ladies by cheating a financier who is weak enough to\r\njoin two of them in a \"parti d'hombre\"--the \"bridge\" of 1750.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of this little room, covered with children who\r\ntake their pleasure in a shower of flowers and birds--interrupted\r\nonly by the blue cama\u00efeux which figure in the corners--brings to\r\nmind the \"oiseaux et autres peintures\" which decorated that of the\r\nRegent's dining-room at Bagnolet, and the whole aspect of the work\r\nrecalls the jewelled colour of the Cabinet in the H\u00f4tel de Rohan.\r\nIt presents also close analogies with the decorations at Champs,\r\nwhich must have been the last work of Christophe Huet's life.\r\n\r\nThese cannot have been executed before 1757, when the\r\nch\u00e2teau was redecorated for Mme. de Pompadour, but they present\r\nnone of the puzzling characteristics of the \"Grand Singerie.\"\r\nThe very words of d'Argenville, who speaks of the \"ornemens\r\nl\u00e9gers entre-m\u00eal\u00e9s d'oiseaux et d'insectes\"[1] on the ceiling of the\r\nSalon, are still applicable, and the blue \"cama\u00efeux\" of the \"Bonbonni\u00e8re\"\r\nat Chantilly are recalled by the Cabinet decorated with\r\n\"cama\u00efeux bleus,\" which opens into the \"chambre \u00e0 coucher\" at\r\nChamps.[2]\r\n\r\nI have not myself had the opportunity of studying Huet's work\r\nin this ch\u00e2teau, but M. Louis Dimier, the author of an admirable\r\n\r\n1 \"Env. Paris\" (ed. 1768). The ch\u00e2teau was then the property of a Mme. Michel,\r\nconcerning whom I cannot discover anything.\r\n\r\n2 These \"cama\u00efeux\" which represented \"des pastorales chinoises\" (d'Arg.,\r\n\"Env. Paris,\" p. 324) still exist, but M. Dimier says that \"Par malheur, ces peintures,\r\nlongtemps recouvertes d'un badigeon se trouvent tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e9grad\u00e9es.

Work of so light and airy a character cannot bear\r\nwithout loss of beauty even the friendly offices by which its existence\r\nis prolonged. The Chinaman, who here occupies the place\r\nof honour, and the ape, who is relegated to a position of inferiority\r\non the lower panels, have alike suffered, it would seem, from the\r\ndelicacy of the scheme in which they form a part. As in the\r\n\"Grande Singerie\" at Chantilly, these figures are relieved on a\r\nwhite ground, and it cannot be maintained that \"la d\u00e9coration\r\nclaire,\" for all its grace and charm, offers the best guarantees\r\nagainst the injuries of time and careless usage.\r\n\r\nThe monochrome medallion became necessarily more and more\r\npopular as a substitute for ornament in relief as the size ot[** typo:of] the\r\nspace to be decorated diminished. The admirable adjustment of\r\npaintings and sculpture was the great feature of the decoration of\r\nthe Salon at Champs, but the little Cabinet could rely wholly on\r\nthe attraction of its \"Pastorales Chinoises en cama\u00efeu.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten in this connection that the scheme\r\nemployed by Lancret[2] in the small room, decorated by him about\r\n1728[3] for de Boullogne, the \"Intendant des ordres du roi,\" affords\r\none of the earlier instances of the successful combination of \"cama\u00efeux,\"\r\narabesques and pictorial decoration. Five pictured panels--one\r\nof which \"The Turk and the Lady with the parasol\" is\r\nknown to us by engraving--were there accompanied by gilt\r\nmedallions of children at play and arabesques on the fashionable\r\nwhite ground.

A certain rigidity of line--which\r\nmarks the construction of the room--foreshadows the reign of the\r\npseudo-classic reaction, and is not without a sober dignity. On\r\nthe other hand, there is no possible impression of chillness or\r\npoverty, for the wealth of brilliant, gay and, in places, amusing\r\ncolour, is splendidly supported by the superb gold ornament in\r\nwhich it is enframed.\r\n\r\nWe are in the middle of the century,[2] at the parting of the\r\nways, and even the floral passages at the base of many of the central\r\npanels remind us how prominent a feature flowers--realistically\r\ntreated--were about to become in all decoration. The successes\r\nof Claude Richard and Bernard de Jussieu (1760) in the gardens\r\nof the Petit Trianon, aroused a passion which ended by making\r\nits way into every house, and raised the painting of rare botanical\r\nspecimens into a branch of art. Tiny sprays of wild flowers and\r\nshadowy pagodas are to be traced on the walls of a little closet, near\r\nthe private rooms of Marie-Antoinette at Versailles, which has\r\nbeen discovered and protected since the rule of M. de Nolhac.\r\nThey are probably the remains of some work by one of the Martin\r\nfamily who are known to have been employed in the ch\u00e2teau.[3]\r\n\r\nThe popularity of their \"vernis\" stimulated the favour extended\r\ntowards the delicate shade of green which gradually entered\r\ninto rivalry with white. It is associated--as in the dismounted\r\npanels of a room in the h\u00f4tel de Soubise--with some of the prettiest\r\ndecorations of the day. \"Un petit cabinet pour M. le Dauphin,\r\nqui est peint en vert\" is chronicled by the Duke de Luynes on the\r\n21st November, 1747,[4] and two years later he notes, on August\r\n\r\n1 See \"French Painters, etc.,\" pp. 59, 60. It was impossible to omit from my first\r\nvolume all mention of these works, but as far as possible I have attempted to distinguish\r\nbetween paintings such as those of the Salon Marcilly (collection of M. Edmond de\r\nRothschild) which have an independent value and existence, and works which are\r\nonly subordinate parts of a general scheme in which various arts are combined.\r\n\r\n2 The \"Four Seasons,\" subjects destined for the decoration of the ceiling of the\r\nSalle du Conseil, were exhibited at the Salon of 1753.

Jacques Doucet, which were decorated by Fragonard, for a\r\nroom in the h\u00f4tel of Mlle. Guimard.[1]\r\n\r\nThe boudoir of Mlle. Duth\u00e9--as notorious in her way as the\r\nfantastic \"Goddess of the Dance\"--was also painted by a famous\r\nmaster, G\u00e9rard van Spaendonck,[2] whose situation in Paris bore\r\nwitness to the fashionable passion for representations of flowers.\r\nHe came to France from Holland in 1770, and the vogue of his\r\nminiatures at once brought round him a large circle of acquaintance\r\n\"parmi lesquels,\" as Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy observes, \"il ne\r\npouvoit manquer de rencontrer des protecteurs utiles.\" Of these\r\nthe most useful was Watelet, who obtained for Van Spaendonck,\r\non the accession of Louis XVI., the \"survivance de la place de\r\npeintre en miniature du roi.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe talent of Van Spaendonck was of an order exactly calculated\r\nto please the young Court. His success and fortune were\r\nrapid, and before long, a box on which he had painted flowers\r\nwith some brilliant accessories was a necessary furnishing of every\r\npocket. With admirable courage he, however, continued to\r\nproduce paintings of his favourite subjects on a large scale, and\r\nattracted general attention by a remarkable tact in arrangement,\r\nand an unusual wealth of accessories, which was made the subject\r\nof hostile criticism. His friends, however, defended him on the\r\nground that \"il n'y a pas de luxe d'ornement que le genre des\r\nfleurs n'admette: \u00e9tant elles-m\u00eames le plus grand luxe de la\r\nnature,\"[4] and by 1781 his triumph was assured.\r\n\r\nThe Academy threw open its doors to him; at every Salon he\r\nwon fresh laurels, and when the Count d'Artois gave to his\r\nbeautiful mistress, Mlle.

Doves, surrounded\r\nby all the emblems of the power of Cupid, nestled on the wreaths\r\nwoven of roses and forget-me-nots, which are suspended in the\r\ncentre, and nothing can be more graceful than the disposition of\r\nthe darts, garlands, and other appropriate ornament by which they\r\nare accompanied. This work seems to have been the happiest\r\nachievement of Van Spaendonck. The days of revolution left him,\r\nindeed, undisturbed at the Jardin des Plantes, in the exercise of\r\nthat professorship of flower-painting to which he had succeeded\r\nin 1780 on the death of Madeleine Basseporte,[1] but they brought\r\nhim no commissions of a similar nature. Thenceforth, his\r\ntime was spent in the exercise of administrative functions; in\r\ngiving instruction to pupils--the most distinguished of whom\r\nwere Redout\u00e9 and Mar\u00e9chal--and in the execution on vellum of\r\nthose delicate water-colour drawings, a large collection of which is\r\nstill preserved at the Library.[2]\r\n\r\nThe passion for the natural representation of flowers continued\r\nto flourish throughout the most doctrinaire period of the pseudo-classic\r\nrevival, but it took a different shape, and demanded that\r\nthey should figure--incongruously allied with the severest types\r\nof conventional ornament--in the least appropriate situations. As\r\nan estimate of the taste of the day, I cannot do better than quote the\r\nwords employed by Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy in eulogy of the results\r\nobtained by Van Spaendonck's later work and teaching in the school\r\nof the Jardin des Plantes: \"Il suffira de rappeler,\" he says, \"tant\u00f4t\r\nces vases, l'orgueil de nos manufactures, soit ceux o\u00f9 la volupt\u00e9 croit\r\nboire dans le calice m\u00eame des fleurs, soit ceux qui dans de plus\r\ngrandes proportions, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 recevoir les mod\u00e8les de leurs peintures,\r\nsemblent en braver la comparaison; tant\u00f4t ces \u00e9toffes brilliantes\r\net ces rares tissus, o\u00f9 la ville de Lyon emploie l'aiguille et le\r\nm\u00e9tier \u00e0 remplacer le pinceau; tant\u00f4t ces magnifiques tapis qui nous\r\nrendent la vue du printemps au milieu des glaces d'hiver, et transportent\r\ndans l'int\u00e9rieur des palais les plates-bandes des jardins.\"[3]\r\n\r\n1 1701-1780. She was a pupil of Claude Aubriet (1651-1743), greatly inferior to\r\nher master, whom she succeeded as \"peintre du Roy, de son cabinet et du Jardin du\r\nRoy\" in 1743. The protection accorded her by Bernard de Jussieu, and her appointment\r\nas drawing-mistress to the children of Louis XV., contributed greatly to her\r\ncredit. (See Henri Stein, In. g\u00e9n.

Of the work by which he is now\r\nbest remembered not a word is spoken. Yet it was one of the last\r\noriginal expressions of the taste and temper of eighteenth century\r\nart. After the style and finish of Audran; the brilliant elegance\r\nof Watteau; the grace and wit of Christophe Huet; the courtly\r\nmagnificence of Boucher; we pass to the ingenious refinements of\r\nthe fragile \"style Pompe\u00efen,\" and then find, in the roses blossoming\r\non the walls of the Duth\u00e9 boudoir, a sorrowful perfume as of\r\nflowers thrown upon the grave.\r\n\r\nWhen the h\u00f4tel was destroyed, the panels of this boudoir were\r\nsaved by M. L\u00e9opold Double,[1] but whilst grateful for their preservation\r\none cannot but regret the disturbance of the scheme of\r\ndecoration in which they played but a part.[2] One cannot too\r\noften insist on the fact that works of this class cannot be treated as\r\nif they were \"easel pictures\" which may be transferred without risk\r\nfrom one place to another. However tenderly and respectfully we\r\nmay use them, however skilfully we may readjust them to our needs,\r\nwe make of them something for which they were not intended--something,\r\nit may be, still charming to the eye, but in which we have\r\nkilled the spirit, form, and colour given to them by their author.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read without pain the long list of private\r\nhouses which have been quite recently demolished or stripped of\r\ntheir decorations, that has been made out by M. de Champeaux in\r\nhis chapters on \"L'Art d\u00e9coratif dans le Vieux Paris.\" The\r\ncompletion of the Boulevard St. Germain brought to the ground\r\nnumbers of noble h\u00f4tels. In 1891, the magnificent carved woodwork\r\nof the h\u00f4tel built in the rue du Bac for the spendthrift son\r\nof Samuel Bernard, was in the hands of a dealer; to different\r\nmembers of the Rothschild family have gone the \"boiseries\" of\r\nthe h\u00f4tel du Maine in the rue de Varennes (Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur); the\r\nfamous carvings with groups in low relief from a house in the rue\r\nDumeril; the decorations from a salon in the h\u00f4tel, built in the\r\nrue de Richelieu for the financier Dodun, and the \"Grand Salon\"\r\nof the h\u00f4tel de Chatillon constructed by Lassurance in 1708.[3]\r\n\r\n1 See the article by M. de Saint-Non. G. B. A., 1869, t. i., p. 390.\r\n\r\n2 At the sale of the collections of M. Double, these panels were bought by\r\nMme. Lelong, then Mme. Bonaf\u00e9. Four other panels, supposed also to have been\r\namongst the decorations of the H\u00f4tel de Mlle. Duth\u00e9, are preserved in the Mus\u00e9e des\r\nArts d\u00e9coratifs. They are probably by Van Spaendonck and are of a similar character,\r\nbut inferior in excellence to those of the boudoir.\r\n\r\n3 This last has, I understand, been transferred to Waddesdon. It was probably\r\ndecorated by Pineau many years later than its construction. See chap. ii., p. 32.",
  "183.png": "\r\nThe spoils of the ch\u00e2teau de Bercy were divided, as we have\r\nseen, between the late Baron James de Rothschild, the Empress\r\nEug\u00e9nie and the Elys\u00e9e; the h\u00f4tel de Sens, more unfortunate than\r\nany, fell for a time under the barbarous rule of the \"Etat-major\r\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Guerre,\" by whom the decorations of seven magnificent\r\nrooms were made away with. Some were sold, but others\r\nserved to feed the fire in the stove of the guard-room, and one\r\nonly now remains to tell us of the pristine splendour of the\r\ninterior. The h\u00f4tel Matignon, bequeathed to the Austrian\r\nEmbassy by the Duchess de Galliera, has been defaced by tasteless\r\nrestoration of the vulgar Italian type, and the whole decoration of\r\nthe H\u00f4tel Salm-Salm executed by Bocquet \"peintre des Menus-Plaisirs,\"\r\nwas swept away in 1871, whilst the \"boiseries\" of the\r\nPalais Royal were then only saved from fire to be rejected by the\r\narchitects employed to arrange the \"Cour des Comptes,\" and sold\r\nto the usual customers of the \"Domaine\"--\"des marchands\r\nauvergnats.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of destruction had been begun under the Revolution\r\nat the promptings of the rage and shame which saw the symbols\r\nof social and moral degradation in all that recalled the \"ancien\r\nr\u00e9gime.\" Unfortunately, the forms in which it was intended to\r\nembody the aspirations after a renewal of national life were\r\nreasoned out rather than felt. Considerations wholly outside\r\nthe province of art were encouraged to prevail in the decision of\r\nmatters regarding the construction of buildings, the decoration and\r\ndistribution of the interior. The minute ornament which in small\r\nrooms had successfully tempered severity of style failed to respond\r\nto the demands of work upon a great scale. Even the taste and\r\nskill of Forty, to whom is due much fine ornament in the central\r\nhall of the H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, fails of effect, and the delicacy and\r\ngrace of his decoration looks thin and poor when contrasted with\r\nthe massive proportions of the vast square room.\r\n\r\nExcess of simplicity developed a rigidity of aspect which\r\nmight, perhaps, have been modified by a profusion of ornament,\r\nbut which--except in the hands of one or two gifted artists--never\r\nattained vitality and style. After the moment of grace in\r\nwhich the classic revival inspired the French genius, as in the\r\nwork of Rousseau de la Rotti\u00e8re and his fellows, with a renewed\r\nideal of beauty, it hardened only too rapidly under the pressure of\r\ndogmatic theories into the showy yet sordid splendour appropriate\r\nto the society represented by the Court of the First Napoleon.",

M. M\u00fcntz has\r\nnoticed that in an age as refined as it was selfish, the manufacture was\r\nnecessarily destined to lose its high national character.[2] The serio-*comic\r\n\"Adventures of Don Quixote\" or the \"Marriage of Ang\u00e9lique\r\nand M\u00e9dor\"[3] occupied looms, previously devoted to \"L'Histoire\r\ndu Roi\" or the \"Triumph of Alexander,\" whilst personifications\r\nof the \"Seasons\" or the \"Elements\" were replaced by scenes from\r\nLa Fontaine's Fables. This change went on until the execution\r\nof a set of chairbacks took precedence of that of a series of\r\nhistorical subjects.\r\n\r\nCommercial considerations had occasionally prevailed at an\r\nearlier date;[4] their predominance was accelerated by the financial\r\ndifficulties of the administration. It was impossible for d'Antin\r\nand de Cotte to find in an exhausted treasury the money necessary\r\nfor carrying out great series of designs commemorating the glories\r\nof France. Again and again workmen, for want of something\r\nworthier of their skill, were set to make \"Chancelleries\"--the\r\n\r\n1 Gerspach, \"La manufacture nationale des Gobelins,\" p. 38.\r\n\r\n2 M\u00fcntz, \"La Tapisserie,\" p. 304.\r\n\r\n3 A fine example of this work may now be seen in the \"Salle du XVIII.

After waiting some years for fresh models at the\r\nbeginning of the century, the Gobelins had only obtained works\r\nsuch as the Old Testament series and the Iliad, by Antoine Coypel\r\n(1718), and the New Testament by Jouvenet and Restout.[1] It\r\nwas natural that they should prefer to repeat the \"Mois grotesques\"\r\nor the \"Porti\u00e8res des Dieux\" by that fine decorator,\r\nClaude Audran, should turn to the \"Indes\" of Desportes or reproduce\r\nfor the Duke du Maine the important series of the \"Belles\r\nChasses de Guise\"--now at Chantilly--which had been already\r\nexecuted at the Gobelins in the previous century, under the title\r\nof \"Chasses avec les Mois de l'Ann\u00e9e,\" after the \"Chasses de\r\nMaximilien\"--the Flemish tapestries of Van Orley.\r\n\r\nThe only new models of any importance given out under the\r\nadministration of the Duke d'Antin were those ordered by him of\r\nCharles Coypel for his personal use--that set of the \"Aventures de\r\nDon Quichotte\" which were at once transferred to the King. The\r\ncartoons for these are still at Compi\u00e8gne, and six of the series,\r\nbrilliant in colour and in a perfect state of preservation, were\r\nexhibited at Berlin in 1892. The entire set extended from twenty-one\r\nto twenty-eight pieces, and had so great success with the\r\npublic that it permanently occupied the looms from 1723 on to the\r\ndays of the Revolution. The repetitions were varied by change\r\nin the colour of the grounds--the marquis de Vogu\u00e9 has, I am told,\r\na set on \"fond rose\" of great beauty--and also by the design of fresh\r\nborders, one of the most important of which is said to have been by\r\nLemaire le cadet.[2] The series shown at Berlin had been bought in\r\n1815 at Paris by Frederic-William III., and belongs to a fine period,\r\nfor each of the six bore the names of the ma\u00eetres-tapissiers du roi,\r\nAudran and Cozette, together with the dates 1774-1776.[3]\r\n\r\nIt was not until Orry succeeded d'Antin in 1736 as \"Directeur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\r\ndes b\u00e2timents\" that the establishment received serious\r\nattention. Under his administration old models were renewed and\r\nnew cartoons commissioned. The eight subjects of \"Les nouvelles\r\nIndes\" were then begun by Fran\u00e7ois Desportes. These were\r\ndestined to replace the set originally executed from drawings made\r\n\r\n1 Gerspach, \"La manufacture nationale des Gobelins,\" pp. 41 and 42.

The\r\ndetails given in Cochin's life of Parrocel are extremely precise on\r\nthese points,[4] but M. Gerspach states that the Gobelins were\r\nengaged in executing from 1732 to 1737 \"gr\u00e2ce sans doute \u00e0 une\r\nfaveur de cour, l'Ambassadeur turc de Parrocel.\" The two works\r\nincluded under this title were, he adds, \"des tableaux, rien de\r\nplus.\" This, however, is a reproach which may be widely\r\ndistributed. It applies equally to the cartoons of de Troy; Oudry's\r\ncelebrated \"Chasses de Louis XV.\" are not free from a like\r\nblame, and the mistaken notion that the more successful the pretence\r\nmade by a piece of tapestry to be that which it is not, the\r\nmore worthy it is of admiration, is as popular now as then.[5]\r\n\r\nAs long as there was no active interference from outside, the\r\ntraditions of earlier days held their own as of necessity, but the\r\nintroduction of new models such as Antoine Coypel's \"Iliad\" or\r\nthe \"New Testament\" of Jouvenet brought about a change for the\r\nworse. With the inept weakness of the one and the somewhat\r\ntheatrical vigour of the other was combined a total misconception\r\nof the principles of decorative design, and the demands made by\r\nthe style of their work are responsible for the fatal attempt to\r\nreproduce \"pictures,\" by which the workmen of the Gobelins\r\nwere driven further and further astray.

The offers of the Emperor were probably\r\nmade when Pineau and others left Paris in 1717,[4] and cannot have\r\nbeen later than 1724, for he died early in February, 1725, several\r\nyears before the first hint of the employment of Oudry on a royal\r\n\"Chasse.\" This is fixed by the execution of the great painting\r\nrepresenting \"une fin de chasse du cerf pris dans l'eau\" with the\r\nlittle ch\u00e2teau of St. Germain en Laye in the background.[5] Exhibited\r\nat the Salon of 1750, this work was actually executed during the\r\nyears 1729 and 1730; Oudry, we are told, received sittings for the\r\nportrait of the King, as well as for those of all the nobles who accompanied\r\nhim and who figured in the foreground,[6] and so great was\r\nthe desire for extreme exactitude that every dog and every horse in\r\nthe group was studied from life.\r\n\r\nThis work was no doubt the first of the commissions given by\r\nd'Antin, and the studies made for it were the basis on which other\r\nand later works were carried out. Finished in 1730, the cartoon\r\nfrom it prepared and put in hand at the Gobelins, Oudry next\r\nreceived the authorization to inspect its manufacture, which was\r\ngiven in 1733.\r\n\r\nAt about the same date, Fagon determined to revive, if possible,\r\nthe ancient prosperity of the tapestry factories founded by Colbert,\r\nat Beauvais, and he entrusted Oudry--who had then been attached\r\n\r\n1 M\u00e9m. in\u00e9d., t. ii., p. 372.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., pp. 372, 374.\r\n\r\n3 Ibid., p. 368.\r\n\r\n4 See chap, ii., p. 24.\r\n\r\n5 M\u00e9m. in\u00e9d., p. 385.\r\n\r\n6 He was, we are told, accompanied \"de M. le comte de Toulouse, de M. le\r\nprince Charles, de M. le Premier, de M.

An inexplicable oversight,\r\nfor Oudry was still in command, and the vigour which he\r\nhad from the first displayed in pushing forward the claims and\r\ninterests of that manufacture had no doubt determined Orry to\r\nconnect him closely with the Gobelins. As we have seen, Oudry\r\nhad exercised the privilege--conferred on painters by old custom--of\r\ninspecting the work in course of execution at the Gobelins from\r\nhis own designs, and his familiarity with the work of the establishment\r\nhad been furthered by his supervision of the series from the\r\n\"Story of Esther,\" carried out in the absence of de Troy.\r\n\r\nThis famous set of hangings has always enjoyed a reputation\r\nfar beyond its deserts, for the character and style of the cartoons,\r\nand the spirit in which they were reproduced under the direction\r\nof Oudry, hastened the transformation of the sound traditions which\r\nhad, for centuries, governed the development of the ancient art of\r\nthe tapestry-worker. To slavishly copy pictures was the new\r\nobject to which his skill was forcibly diverted, and the hangings of\r\n\r\n1 M\u00e9m in\u00e9d., t. ii., p. 375.\r\n\r\n2 He died 30th April; see P.

His Cabinet, which sold for 40,000 l., consisted\r\nof \"vases, figures, de porcelaines et de curiosit\u00e9s de Chine,\" but he admitted no\r\npictures but his own, and was taxed with having frequently sold copies which he\r\nretouched in order not to part with the originals. Desportes used to say he \"liked\r\nan Oudry well enough if it was entirely from his hand\" (Ibid., p. 371.) This throws\r\nlight on the cause of the great inequality of work signed by Oudry. It is certain that\r\nhe, often, only sketched in the dog or other beasts in his foreground, and we rarely\r\nfind even in France, work equal to studies such as that painted by him in 1739 of the\r\n\"Panth\u00e8re couch\u00e9e dans sa cage\" in the National Museum, Stockholm.

Making\r\ncommon cause, it is true, with the painters as well as the public of\r\nthat day, Oudry insisted that their cartoons should be exactly reproduced,\r\nand that the full tone and colour should be imitated as closely\r\nas possible. In vain the workmen protested that \"bien peindre et\r\nbien faire ex\u00e9cuter des tapisseries sont choses absolument diff\u00e9rentes.\"[2]\r\nTheir rich inheritance of taste and skill, the wisdom accumulated\r\nby ages of experience, were counted for nothing. Oudry\r\nand the painters triumphed, yet Oudry himself might have been\r\nenlightened if he had but compared--as we may now do at Fontainebleau[3]--his\r\nown \"Chasses du roi,\" with the masterly translations\r\nfrom them--four of which had been completed before his accession\r\nto the chief post of authority,--made under his own eyes before\r\nhe had accomplished his mistaken reform, and had substituted\r\ntame and servile copyists for the brilliant artists who had been\r\nformed by the inherited traditions of a great decorative art.\r\n\r\nIf, as M. Eug\u00e8ne M\u00fcntz puts it, we now compare the paintings\r\nof Oudry at Fontainebleau, \"d'une ex\u00e9cution lisse et\r\nmonotone, aux merveilleuses traductions, si vibrantes, si pleines de\r\nvie, qu'en ont donn\u00e9es les tapissiers du si\u00e8cle dernier, on ne peut\r\nque plaindre cet artiste \u00e9minent d'avoir si compl\u00e8tement m\u00e9connu\r\nles int\u00e9r\u00eats de sa gloire.\" In \"Le Rendezvous\" and \"Le Relai,\"\r\nas in others of this series, we get that delightful exactness and\r\nvitality of movement, which distinguish Oudry's best work. The\r\nplacing of the figures in the landscape,[4] as in the \"Rendezvous,\"\r\nwith its skilfully varied planes, is an extraordinarily happy example\r\nof the \"Verdure \u00e0 personnages;\" every indication has been seized\r\nand preserved by the wonderful tact and intelligence of the inter-*\r\n\r\n1 \"La manufacture nationale des Gobelins,\" p. 47.\r\n\r\n2 Lacordaire, \"Les Gobelins,\" ed. 1855, p. 81.\r\n\r\n3 There is a set at Florence, in the National Museum, of richer quality even than\r\nthat at Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n4 Ch\u00e2telain, the landscape painter (R. 30th July, 1740, P.V.) was specially\r\nattached in this capacity as inspector of the works at the Gobelins during these years.\r\nSee Appendix D.",

The dictates of good\r\nsense, just economy, and the principles of a great decorative art\r\nhad to be trampled down before it could be possible to give to\r\ntapestry what Oudry characterized as \"tout l'esprit et toute\r\nl'intelligence des tableaux.\" The question of economy alone was\r\nvery serious, and probably helped awhile as a check on the\r\ndisastrous intentions of the administration. The entrepreneurs of\r\nthe Gobelins were paid--when they were paid--by the piece;\r\nbut on the introduction of the new system the worker was placed\r\nat the mercy of the ever increasing exactions of the painter, who\r\npainted in total ignorance of the practical difficulties in the way of\r\nthe carrying out of his designs. It thus became impossible for\r\nmen to calculate or limit the cost of execution, for any pieces of\r\nwork which did not please Oudry had to be cut out and worked\r\nafresh, until an effect which satisfied his exigencies had been\r\nachieved.[2]\r\n\r\nThe opposition aroused continued to be so formidable that even\r\nTournehem had to take account of it, and was forced to temporize.\r\nOn the margin of one of the M\u00e9moires, sent in by the entrepreneurs\r\nin 1748, occurs a note in his own hand to Monsieur\r\nd'Isle, then the directeur-particulier,[3] which sums up the awkward\r\nproblems of the situation. \"Il me paroit,\" he says, \"n\u00e9cessaire\r\nde rassurer les entrepreneurs, sans rien changer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat pr\u00e9sent. Je\r\nlaisse \u00e0 Monsieur d'Isle, sur ce que nous avons dit ensemble, de\r\nfaire agir, en cette occasion, sa prudence.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe entrepreneurs adopted a policy of sullen obstinacy. It was\r\nnot until the year preceding his death that Oudry, through the\r\nsolicitation of his friend L\u00e9pici\u00e9, obtained from Marigny--who\r\nhad succeeded his uncle as \"directeur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" in 1751--an order\r\nto compel the recalcitrant entrepreneurs to attend on him when he\r\nmade \"ses visites d'ouvrages de la manufacture\"--visits against\r\nwhich they had tacitly protested by their absence. Thus, on the\r\neve of death, Oudry's triumph was completed. The tapestry\r\nworkers yielded to force, and had to accept for their guidance the\r\ntheories of one concerning whom they had declared \"le plus faible\r\n\r\n1 Lacordaire, \"Les Gobelins,\" ed. 1855, p. 81.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., p. 82.\r\n\r\n3 D'Isle was director from 1747 to 1755, in which year he was succeeded by\r\nSoufflot, who held the post till 1780-1.

In spite of the \"grand\r\nd\u00e9bit\" which, it was alleged, had aroused the jealousy of Paris,\r\nthe tapissiers of the Marche were in dire distress. They could\r\nboast of their skill and assert that it had been handed down from\r\nfather to son, whilst it had been necessary for the workmen of the\r\ncapital, \"de faire venir des Paiis Bas, \u00e0 leur confusion deux\r\n\u00e9trangers ... pour leur apprendre leur m\u00e9tier,\" but their situation,\r\nas described by M. de Bonneval,[2] in 1743-1744, was that of\r\nexceptional hardship. After entering into minute particulars, he\r\nconcludes his report by the statement, \"qu'il n'y a point dans le\r\nRoyaume de ville de fabriques o\u00f9 les ouvriers soient aussi\r\nmis\u00e9rables, quoique ce m\u00e9tier exige presque autant de travail\r\nd'imagination que de corps.\"\r\n\r\nThe attention of Oudry's patron, Fagon, had been early called\r\nto the state of the proud and ancient Royal Factory of Aubusson.\r\nHe does not, however, seem to have given it the consideration\r\nextended to Beauvais, and contented himself by the appointment\r\nof Jean-Joseph du Mons as peintre-dessinateur attached to the service\r\nof both Aubusson and Felletin.[3] Under the influence of du Mons\r\nthe condition of the two factories seems to have bettered somewhat,\r\nfor, on the death of Oudry, du Mons' services were held to\r\njustify his nomination to the vacant post at Beauvais. It is, however,\r\npossible that this was merely an arrangement by which these\r\ntwo factories--always dependant on local enterprise, with the exception\r\nof the teaching and inspection provided by the administration--were\r\nleft wholly at the mercy of the ordinary conditions of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe products of Beauvais had, indeed, long been accounted\r\nsuperior for verdures to those of Felletin and for tapisseries \u00e0\r\npersonnages[4] to those of Aubusson, but from a certain point of\r\n\r\n1 Gerspach, \"La manufacture nationale des Gobelins,\" p. 45.\r\n\r\n2 \"M\u00e9moires pour les manufactures royales d'Aubusson et de Felletin.\" L\u00e9opold\r\nGravier, \"La Tapisserie d'Aubusson,\" pp. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n3 A. de l'A. fr., t. v., pp. 378, 379; also \"Instructions Machault,\" Gravier ut\r\nsupra, pp. 8, 9, 10.\r\n\r\n4 I have seen a specially interesting example of an Aubusson, \"Verdure p\u00e2le a",

The high rank attained by the work of Aubusson\r\nin the preceding century may be seen in various fine series, such\r\nas the famous \"Jeux d'Enfants,\" from the designs of Michel\r\nCorneille in the Garde-Meuble of the Ville de Paris.\r\n\r\nThe age of Louis XIV. was in certain points, both of style and\r\nexecution, the golden age of this art of tapestry.[1] With the course\r\nof the eighteenth century there is a more or less continuous\r\ndecadence. Early examples, whether from Beauvais or the\r\nGobelins, show the fine red browns, the clear carnations, which\r\nseem as fresh as the work of yesterday, and are distinguished by a\r\nsplendid quality of sustained colour such as was exemplified in the\r\nhighly decorative set--executed at Beauvais from the designs of\r\nGillot--lent by M. Maillet Dubouley to the Exposition de l'Art\r\nr\u00e9trospectif in 1865--and in the noble series of the \"Porti\u00e8res\r\ndes Dieux\" by Claude Audran, belonging to the town of Paris,\r\nwhich was carried out at the Gobelins in the earliest years of the\r\ncentury.[2]\r\n\r\nThese famous hangings, like the \"Triomphes\" of No\u00ebl\r\nCoypel, present the most admirable examples of the treatment of\r\nthe human figure as an element of decoration. When they were\r\nproduced, the old methods which Oudry had set himself to destroy\r\nwere still paramount; as long as the number of gradations in\r\neach tint was strictly limited, the dangers of unequal fading or of\r\ntotal change were minimized; their multiplication in the vain\r\nambition to rival the infinite variety of hue commanded by the\r\npainter's art destroyed every chance of ensuring permanent harmony.\r\nSuch considerations were for the moment reckoned as of\r\nno account, and the successors of Oudry, as we shall see, lost no\r\ntime in the endeavour to perfect the disastrous \"reforms\" which\r\nthey had encouraged him to initiate.\r\n\r\nfigures pastorales,\" in the collection of M.

The three entrepreneurs,\r\nAudran, Cozette, and Neilson, smarting under the\r\nperemptory orders by which his predecessor had enforced their\r\nunwilling attendance on his instructions, wrote to Marigny almost\r\nwith gratitude: \"La satisfaction,\" they said, \"que nous ressentons\r\nde la nomination de M. Boucher, au lieu et place du feu sieur\r\nOudry, nous est trop agr\u00e9able, Monsieur, pour ne pas vous en\r\nmarquer notre sinc\u00e8re reconnaissance.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe hopes aroused by this appointment were, however,\r\ndoomed from the first. Boucher believed, like Oudry, that the\r\nbeauty of tapestry lay in its exact imitation of painting. The\r\nunfortunate tendencies fostered by his dictation were indeed\r\ntempered, as far as the beauty of the work was concerned, by his\r\nadmirable instinct for decoration, the charm of his lively design,[2]\r\nand the gaiety of his colour. These qualities rendered the\r\n\"Balan\u00e7oire\"[3]--the design of which he had supplied to Beauvais--*\r\n\r\n1 Lacordaire, \"Les Gobelins,\" ed. 1855, p. 84.\r\n\r\n2 The treatment of the designs for the \"Four Elements,\" a fine set of which but\r\nrecently in England, is now in the possession of M. Camille Groult--is a case in\r\npoint. Above the groups which personify Air and Fire, Earth and Water, stretches\r\nthe luminous sky, the light falls on the figures and detaches them from the solid base\r\nof rich accessory on which they rest. The white cat in \"La Terre\" fixes the date\r\nof the production of this \"tenture,\" and reminds us that the original of the portrait\r\nwas given to Mme. de Pompadour by the Siamese ambassadors.\r\n\r\n3 This subject was undoubtedly suggested by Watteau's beautiful arabesque\r\n\"L'Escarpolette.\" See \"French Painters of the Eighteenth Century,\" pp. 52",

To some extent they propitiated men\r\nwho, as may be inferred from their own words, had seen with\r\njealousy the prosperity and popularity of the rival manufactory.\r\n\"He has told us,\" said the entrepreneurs, \"that he had refused the\r\nmost liberal offers made to him by the directors of the manufacture\r\nof Beauvais in order to devote himself wholly to us.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Academy were affected by the renewed interest in the\r\nGobelins aroused by the advent of Boucher and Soufflot. They\r\naccorded special places to the sons of the entrepreneurs in their\r\n\"Ecole de dessin,\" and declared that the Company desired to\r\nshare in the efforts then being made to bring the great manufacture\r\nto perfection.[2] In the establishment itself the satisfaction\r\nexpressed must have been a question of persons rather than of\r\nprinciples, for, in spite of tradition, in spite of opposition, in spite\r\nof the expenditure which they entailed, the ideas upheld by Oudry\r\nhad taken firm root.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years[3] the three entrepreneurs, Audran, Cozette,\r\nand the Scotchman, Jacques Neilson, were devoting themselves\r\nto the re-organization of the dye-works, in order to meet the\r\nexigencies of the painters. The artificial and charming art of\r\nBoucher was supreme. In order to translate in tapestry the\r\n\"chairs nacr\u00e9es et tous les gris qui dominent dans ses tableaux,\r\nles entrepreneurs durent abandonner leur ancienne palette, demander\r\n\u00e0 la teinture d'autres nuances et appliquer celles-ci suivant des\r\nprincipes tout nouveaux.\"\r\n\r\nJacques Neilson, a man of remarkable gifts, had already distinguished\r\nhimself in a different direction. With the aid of\r\nVaucanson and under the superintendence of Soufflot, he had\r\nintroduced the loom still employed for \"basse lisse.\" He was\r\nnow called to take a leading part in the reform of the dye-works,\r\nand with him, at this stage, there enters on the scene one whose\r\nmiserable end is an example of the fate which awaited those who\r\ndevoted life and fortune to the service of the Crown. \"Apr\u00e8s\r\nbien des recherches,\" says Montucla,[4] \"les sieurs Neilson, Cozette\r\net Audran, mais surtout le sieur Neilson, qui met dans la recherche\r\nde tout ce qui peut servir \u00e0 son art beaucoup d'activit\u00e9, ont trouv\u00e9\r\n\r\nand 90.

At the\r\nsame time Neilson begged to be relieved of his functions at the dye-works.[2]\r\nHe and his colleagues were in dire straits. Audran was\r\nruined, Neilson's private fortune had been swallowed up by the advances\r\nwhich he had made for the prosecution of Quemiset's researches,\r\nnor were the workmen employed by him in any better case.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the tapestry workers were not only always in\r\narrears but it was impossible to establish satisfactory rates of payment,\r\nas the piece-work system continued to prevail. Complicated\r\nwork was highly remunerated, but even so the pay was not\r\nsufficient to indemnify the worker for the difficulties attending its\r\nexecution, and thus the more highly skilled man often received\r\nnext to nothing for his labour, whilst his neighbour engaged on a\r\ntask presenting no special problem, made a good week. The\r\nremedy was obvious, yet it was not until Pierre had been received\r\non his first visit as director of the Gobelins[3] with something like\r\nviolence, that any attention was paid to the wrongs of those there\r\nemployed, nor were they righted, till, after many hesitations, on\r\nthe proposal of Charles-Axel Guillaumot, Pierre's successor, all\r\nwere placed on fixed salaries[4]--a system which has endured up\r\nto the present time.[5]\r\n\r\nA feature of the situation essentially characteristic of the suffering\r\ninflicted by the old r\u00e9gime is to be found in the contrast\r\nbetween the callous neglect with which these unfortunate servants\r\nof the Crown were treated whilst engaged on their labours,[6] and\r\nthe intolerable cruelties practised on them if they were even sus-*\r\n\r\n1 Lacordaire, \"Les Gobelins,\" ed. 1855, p. 92.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., p. 94, and ed. 1853, pp. 110, 111; Gerspach, \"La manufacture nationale\r\ndes Gobelins,\" p. 112.\r\n\r\n3 10th January, 1782.\r\n\r\n4 23rd December, 1790.

From England alone, it seems to\r\nhave been supposed, serious rivalry was to be dreaded.

The \"Evanouissement\r\nd'Armide,\" executed from the designs of Charles Coypel in\r\n1739,[5] is carefully calculated for this impression of great lightness,\r\nand, so all-pervading is the tendency, that strong rich colour--such\r\nas that obtained by Beauvais workmen in the two examples\r\n\r\n1 N.

Henri Lehmann[2]--immediately gives\r\nthe impression of a date far earlier than that at which these works\r\nwere actually executed. In \"Le Retour de Chasse\" and \"Le\r\nD\u00e9jeuner\" we find rose-reds framed in gold, glorious oriental greens\r\nand full hues, not usual from the palette of Boucher, and one contrasts\r\nthe aspect of these products of the looms of Beauvais with\r\nthe lively brilliance of the colour to be recognized in the Gobelins\r\nseries of the same subjects, such as the fine set hanging in the\r\ngallery of M. Groult.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the \"Psych\u00e9 et l'Amour,\" \"Vertumne et Pomone\"[3]\r\nor other of the marvels executed by Neilson, after Boucher, in 1757,\r\nfor the Salle du Conseil of the chateau de Compi\u00e8gne, we find a\r\nsimilar intention. It characterizes the graceful \"Pan et Amymone\"[4]--which,\r\nif not by him, is certainly of his school--it is\r\npresent in \"La Mort d'Adonis,\" in \"Le Sommeil dangereux\"--a\r\nwork in which the fantastic landscape studies at the Albertina\r\nseem to have found their place,--and is equally marked even in\r\n\"La Pastorale,\" a late work, dated 1760, which would be a verdure\r\nwere it not for the tawny coat of a dog and the yellow jacket and\r\nred breeches of his master.[5] The same light scale was affected in\r\nthat earlier and superb example of the looms of Beauvais, the\r\n\"V\u00e9nus descendant de son char pour demander \u00e0 Vulcain des armes\r\npour \u0152n\u00e9e[** pas \u0152n\u00e9e mais \u00c9n\u00e9e],\" lent by M. Belleyme in 1865 to the \"Exposition des\r\nArts d\u00e9coratifs,\" but this work, which was carried out, in 1749,\r\nfrom Boucher's designs, was wonderfully free from the fadeur which\r\ncreeps over the productions of a later date. The brilliancy and\r\nspirit of the whole scheme spoke eloquently of the painter's best\r\ntime, and the translator--the piece was marked with a fleur-de-lis\r\nand the initials \"A. C. C. Beauvais\"[6]--had ably emphasized all\r\nthat lent itself most helpfully to the best traditions of his art.\r\n\r\n1 Nine drawings made by Boucher for this set to be executed in basse lisse at\r\nBeauvais in 1742, are now in the Mus\u00e9e of Besan\u00e7on, Nos. 30-38. This set must\r\nnot be confused with the \"Tenture des Divertissements Chinois,\" designed for\r\nBeauvais by Dumont le Romain. Two of these, \"La R\u00e9colte des Ananas\" and\r\n\"Astronomes Chinois,\" are in the Garde-Meuble of the Ville de Paris.\r\n\r\n2 One of these has a landscape background, the other a view of the sea.\r\n\r\n3 Now in the Louvre.\r\n\r\n4 See Louvre, No. 714, \"Neptune et Amymone\" (Collection de Louis XV.\r\nMod\u00e8le de tapisserie).\r\n\r\n5 These four examples are in the Garde-Meuble of the Ville de Paris.\r\n\r\n6 The same initials and mark were to be found on a hanging designed by Leprince--\"Tartares\r\nmenant joyeuse vie\"--which was exhibited at the same time.",
  "213.png": "\r\nThese traditions held their ground, I think, somewhat later at\r\nBeauvais than at the Gobelins, where the influence of the painters\r\nwas, perhaps, exercised more directly and persistently on the\r\nweavers. Even when dealing with the pleasant receipt, which--in\r\nhis failing years--Boucher concocted by framing his centres of\r\nwarm light in pale greens and yellows, and detaching on them\r\nhues of rich rose-red with a touch of dark blue, the weaver of\r\nBeauvais often contrives to transform the whole scheme simply by\r\nhis treatment of this blue, and the value and depth which he gives\r\nto it in relation to the more brilliant colours. It was not, however,\r\npossible to escape the pressure of fashion. In the later\r\nproductions of the Beauvais looms we see a steadily growing\r\ntendency towards an uninteresting pallor of general aspect, which\r\nis not always to be set down to the increasing untrustworthiness of\r\nthe materials employed, for to a considerable extent it is due to intentional\r\ncompliance with popular taste. It might seem uncivil to\r\nspecify examples in private collections, to which one has access\r\nthrough the civility of their owners, as instances of decadence, but\r\nevery lover of this beautiful art must have grieved again and again\r\nover subjects in which all the planes have been lost; in which\r\nthe sky and the architectural background are blent in one, and the\r\ngroups of the foreground are inextricably confused with foliage\r\nand other accessories. The Ville de Paris alone possesses specimens\r\nenough of the cruel evanescence which has left but the\r\ntraces of original beauty in such work as Casanova's \"Campement\r\nde Boh\u00e9miens\" (Beauvais, 1763), \"La Lev\u00e9e d'un Camp\"\r\n(Gobelins, about 1763),[1] and \"Le Fauconnier\"--a design in itself\r\nof great spirit--which, together with two fragments of a \"Sc\u00e8ne\r\nde Bivouac\" (Gobelins, 1763)--an important work which has been\r\nmutilated---hang in the Mus\u00e9e Galliera.[2]\r\n\r\nYet, if much of the tapestry of this century will not stand the\r\ntest of exposure to light, and has ignored to its own loss some of\r\nthe cardinal virtues of this most excellent art, we must admit the\r\npeculiar charm of typical works which have, by some lucky chance\r\nescaped irrevocable injury from time. Of this class are the beautiful\r\nset of the Four Seasons, \"Amusements champ\u00eatres,\" which belong\r\nto Mme. Andr\u00e9. Given, it is said, by Louis XV. to a Russian\r\nambassador, they had not been unpacked from the day they left\r\nBeauvais until they came into the hands of M. Andr\u00e9; hence the\r\n\r\n1 One of the set of \"Convois Militaires.\"\r\n\r\n2 The set of the \"Amours des Dieux,\" by Boucher, woven at Beauvais, 1755-75--one\r\nof which, \"Ariane et Bacchus,\" belongs to M. Groult--have also suffered severely\r\nfrom fading.",

Rodolphe Kann, which retain the special\r\nquality originally sought by their makers. This fine set--made,\r\nI am told, at the Gobelins for, or given to the Admiral d'Estaing\r\nin 1740--remained in a ch\u00e2teau near Clermont-Ferrand as late as\r\n1870, when they were sold and came to England. Their owner\r\nhas now parted with them and they have returned to France. In\r\nlooking at them, one recognizes at once the charm of the mother-o'-pearl\r\ntints--\"les gris nacr\u00e9s,\" which were, at that day, held to\r\nbe the very triumph of seductive colour. The evanescent grace\r\nof these tender hues still lingers in the atmosphere which envelopes\r\n\"La Bergerie,\" \"La Le\u00e7on de musique,\" \"La P\u00eache,\"\r\n\"L'Oiseleur,\" and is perceptible, if less obvious, in the little piece\r\ncalled \"Les Vendanges,\" by which the set is completed. If one\r\nturns from these works to the entertaining trio of scenes from\r\nMoli\u00e8re--executed at the Gobelins ten years earlier from the\r\ndesigns of Oudry--which are also in the h\u00f4tel of M. Kann, we\r\ncan measure at a glance the revolutionary change which then\r\ntook place. \"Le Malade imaginaire,\" dated \"J.-B. Oudry 1730,\"\r\n\"L'Ecole des maris,\" and \"Le D\u00e9pit amoureux,\" which bear the\r\nsame signature with the date \"1732,\" are treated in the style of\r\nCoypel's \"Don Quixote,\" and show a strength of colour, and, in\r\nthe employment of the flowers which blossom on a \"fond jonquille,\"\r\nan exquisite decorative fitness which render them as\r\nremarkable in their way as the four wonderful Beauvais porti\u00e8res\r\nonce in the Wallace collection, the borders of which Oudry had\r\nenriched with the most enchanting birds.\r\n\r\nThese borders remind us, alas, that one of the most lamentable,\r\nif inevitable consequences of the determination to see in tapestry\r\nonly the means for the reproduction of paintings was the ruthless\r\nsuppression of the borders which were of equal importance and\r\nequal beauty with the subject in elder work. The \"Sc\u00e8nes d'Op\u00e9ra\"\r\nafter Charles Coypel (1763-1765) show the transformation of these\r\nfine decorations into the odious and poverty-stricken invention of\r\nan ordinary frame. Oudry was one of the first to accept it as\r\nsufficient in his \"Chasses du roi\": its popularity increased under\r\nthe rule of Boucher, and the grace and fancy previously lavished\r\non the old \"encadrements\" were ignominously[** typo: ignominiously] banished.\r\n\r\nSomething must be said before the close of this chapter of the",

The earliest\r\ninstance cited by M. Gerspach is the permission given in 1748, to\r\nM. Bouvet de Villaumont, tr\u00e9sorier-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la maison du roi,\r\nto order at the Gobelins, the coverings for four chairs and a sofa on\r\ncondition that the designs be submitted to the director and to\r\nCharles Coypel, then premier-peintre.[2] There is, however, an\r\nearlier record, for in 1739, M. Heron de Villefosse, receveur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\r\ndes finances de Champagne, ordered a \"meuble de tapisserie\" consisting\r\nof eight chairs and a sofa.[3] It is, however, possible that\r\nthis was a private contract between Louis Nouzon, \"tapissier des\r\nGobelins,\" and M. de Villefosse, since under special conditions\r\nthose employed in the royal manufactory were allowed to undertake\r\nwork outside.\r\n\r\nThe fashion rapidly became popular, and the execution of\r\nscreens, seats and chair-backs, displaying pictures accompanied by\r\ndecorative bouquets, knots of ribband and garlands, flourished at\r\nthe Gobelins and made the fortune of Beauvais. From Beauvais\r\ncame the coverings--decorated with subjects \u00e0 la Boucher--of the\r\nfamous fauteuils in the collection of M. Double, the frames of which\r\nwere signed by no less a sculptor than Etienne Falconnet.[4] The\r\ncost of work such as this, which was ordered for Rambouillet by\r\nthe Count de Toulouse, was as great, if not greater than that of\r\nthe embroidered silks and velvets which to some extent it displaced,\r\nthereby causing the embroiderers in their turn to strive to\r\nrival the weavers by aiming at pictorial effect.\r\n\r\nFor a long while women were pleased with the simple tent-*stitch\r\non canvas in which the young ladies of St. Cyr delighted,\r\nand of this there is an admirable example in the lit de parade\r\n\r\n1 Courajod, \"Livre-Journal Duvaux,\" t. i., pp. cxx, cxxi, cxxii, and cxxiii.\r\n\r\n2 Gerspach, \"La manufacture nationale des Gobelins,\" pp. 47 and 48.\r\n\r\n3 It was stipulated concerning these, that \"tous les dits ouvrages seront faits et\r\nfabriqu\u00e9s en soie ainsy que les fonds bruns exc\u00e9dent le cartouche, except\u00e9 n\u00e9anmoins\r\nles bruns qui servent \u00e0 ombrer l'ouvrage, qui seront en laine fine de bon teint, conform\u00e9ment\r\naux desseins et tableaux qui sont et seront accept\u00e9s par mondit sieur de\r\nVillefosse.\" N.

The help from painting\r\non which the embroiderers at first relied when they wished to\r\ncreate illusion was soon absolutely rejected, and the description of\r\nthe carriages sent to Vienna in 1770 for Marie-Antoinette shows\r\nto what perfection their work had then attained. \"Ce sont,\" says\r\nBachaumont, \"deux berlines, beaucoup plus grandes que les\r\ncarosses ordinaires, mais plus petites que sont ceux du roi....\r\nL'une est rev\u00eatue d'un velours ras cramoisi en dehors, o\u00f9 les quatre\r\nSaisons sont brod\u00e9es en or sur les principaux panneaux, avec tous\r\nles attributs relatifs \u00e0 la f\u00eate.

Vincent's\r\n\"Combat des Romains et Sabins,\" is pronounced interesting as a\r\nsubject and deserving as a model of art; the subject of \"Aurore et\r\nC\u00e9phale\" is said to be in no wise objectionable, but the \"Arriv\u00e9e\r\nde Cl\u00e9opatre en Cilicie\" is censured as a \"sujet anti-r\u00e9publicain.\"\r\nThe cartoons of Raphael, probably as embodying \"des id\u00e9es superstitieuses\"\r\nare thrown out, together with those of the \"Esther\"\r\nand \"Medea\" of de Troy, which are condemned \"sous le rapport\r\nde l'art.\" \"La Maison Royale\" deserves reprobation \"sous tous\r\nles rapports,\" and, along with that set, go \"tous les tableaux\r\nd'ornemen rev\u00eatus des signes de f\u00e9odalit\u00e9,\" but regret is expressed\r\nas to the bad state of Coypel's \"Aventures de Don Quichotte\" on\r\nthe ground that they present a subject which \"tournant la\r\nchevalerie en ridicule, les rend dignes d'\u00eatre conserv\u00e9s.\"\r\n\r\nOn these principles the \"classement des mod\u00e8les\" was proceeded\r\nwith.

Cournault, \"tous les ornements \u00e9taient relev\u00e9s\r\npar diff\u00e9rentes couleurs d'or qui, par leur vari\u00e9t\u00e9, produisaient un\r\neffet des plus agr\u00e9ables.

Il dut\r\nse contenter d'employer une seule couleur d'or.\"[3] The result is the\r\npresent monotonous brilliancy, which detracts from the impressive\r\ncharacter of these triumphs of the forge.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the architect--extraordinarily powerful in all\r\nepochs of large coherent art--was as great at Nancy as at Paris,\r\nand had counted for much in the development of Lamour's remarkable\r\npowers. He was over forty when he came in touch with\r\nEmmanuel Her\u00e9 at Chanteheux, and there found his golden\r\n\r\n1 See \"French Architects and Sculptors,\" p. 14.\r\n\r\n2 1698-1771.

Cournault\r\nadmits, had it not been for King Stanislas, a skilful workman he\r\nwould have remained, \"mais ne serait pas devenu l'illustre serrurier\r\nque l'on connait.\" Nor is this epithet \"illustrious\" too strong if\r\nwe look not only to the stupendous character of his technical\r\nachievements, but also to the beauty and originality of many of\r\nhis designs.\r\n\r\nThe great \"grilles\" at the four angles of the \"Place\"--the\r\ntwo which serve as triumphal gateways, and the two facing them,\r\nin front of which stand the fountain groups by Barth\u00e9lemy\r\nGuibal;[1] the subsidiary decorations of a like, though less important\r\ncharacter, which dignify the streets running east and west,\r\ndo not seem to have been regarded by Lamour with more satisfaction\r\nthan the magnificent staircase of the \"H\u00f4tel de Ville.\" Of\r\nthis work, he himself says, with justifiable pride: \"La courbure\r\ndes doubles rampes ne semble pas \u00eatre un ouvrage de fer forg\u00e9.\r\nLa platebande annonce un m\u00e9tal moul\u00e9 et pouss\u00e9 par le fer d'un\r\nmenuisier, puisqu'il n'y a dans tous ses contours aucun jarret ni\r\ngauche qui d\u00e9range un dessin serr\u00e9.... Il faut \u00eatre de l'art pour\r\ncomprendre combien il faut de justesse pour profiler et contourner\r\nces pi\u00e8ces, sans s'\u00e9carter du plan, combien il faut faire rouler le\r\ncalibre pour dresser toutes les moulures, filets et faces, pour ne\r\npoint corrompre cette forme.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThus--in the preface to the \"Recueil\" of his designs for work\r\nordered by King Stanislas which Lamour published in 1767--speaks\r\nthe craftsman, proud of his excellence in his craft; but as\r\nwe go from spot to spot in Nancy, seeking out the signs of his\r\nhand--still visible in many a street, on many a house--the things\r\nwhich delight us most are not those which tell us in the first place\r\nof Lamour's great skill and the King's munificence, but rather\r\nthose which speak to us of his taste. No work from Lamour's\r\nhand is, I think, equal from this point of view, to that which he\r\nput into the \"grilles\" of his own house (32, rue N\u00f4tre Dame),\r\nexquisite alike in beauty of detail, and grace and play of curve.\r\n\r\n1 Barth\u00e9lemy Guibal, 1699-1757. He was sculptor to the three last Dukes of\r\nLorraine. The groups of the fountains of Neptune and of Amphitrite on the Place\r\nStanislas are his best works. To his chief pupil, Cyffl\u00e9--attached to the Manufactory\r\nof Niederwiller--are attributed most of the little figures and groups in \"terre de\r\nLorraine,\" such as the \"Nymph and Lamb\" in the Jones collection at South Kensington,\r\nnow much in fashion.

  "229.png": "\r\nSuch work as this shows that the school of Nancy, which took\r\nshape under the rule of King Stanislas, was in certain respects a\r\nthing apart, having a specially exuberant and jovial character.\r\nThe work of Jean Lamour is eloquent of the transition moment of\r\nthe earlier days of the century, but if we compare his designs\r\nwith those of Lalonde,[1] or with the work at the Petit Trianon of\r\nthe \"ma\u00eetre-serrurier,\" Fran\u00e7ois Gamain,[2] we see that there is a\r\ndifference not merely of date. The work of Lalonde and of\r\nGamain speaks, as does the fine \"rampe d'escalier\" of the Bourse\r\nat Bordeaux, of the influence of Gabriel, whilst that of Lamour,\r\neven when determined by the guidance of Emmanuel Her\u00e9, has\r\nmoments of pure eccentricity.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature of his design is the extraordinary\r\nlightness with which his technical skill enabled him to treat rather\r\nvulgar scrolls and current lines and shell curves, and the taste with\r\nwhich he could employ details not always well selected, so as to\r\nrob them of offence. If we compare with the \"Recueil\" of\r\nLamour that \"cahier\" in which Lalonde has consigned his\r\nsketches for \"grilles et rampes d'escalier,\" we find in the last a\r\nsomewhat too painful determination, but also, it must be confessed,\r\na power of design on a great scale to which Lamour, I think,\r\nnever attained. In his \"Grille du Palais Marchand,\" as in the\r\n\"Projet de porte en serrurerie,\" which figured at the \"Exposition\r\ndu Mus\u00e9e des Arts d\u00e9coratifs,\" Lalonde puts down his symmetrical\r\nbands of ornament within a solid framework of pilasters and cornice\r\nwhich have the air of an architectural monument; his style allows\r\nfor no sport of irregular fancy--that, within certain limits, proper\r\ndelight of the true smith working pincers in hand. Nor is the\r\nwork of Gamain--the smith with whom Louis XVI. loved to\r\nlabour, and who betrayed to Roland the cachette which he had\r\nhelped the unfortunate King to make--free from the reproach of\r\nthe same weight and formality. They are evident in the design,\r\nbeautiful as it is in some respects, of the fine staircase which he\r\nplaced in the \"Petit Trianon\" for Louis XV.,[3] and which was\r\nthere left undisturbed by his successors.\r\n\r\nThis work, however, if it gives less room for the graceful play\r\nof fancy in its details, is, by the general disposition of its lines and\r\n\r\n1 See chap. v., pp. 83, 84.\r\n\r\n2 1751-1795.

The weakness which strikes us as we\r\nanalyze the leading features of this design, is avoided at the Petit\r\nTrianon. The pattern is spaced, on the climbing stairs, with\r\nperpendicular lines, sufficiently varied to amuse the eye, but\r\naccentuated with a vigour which takes hold of the more ornamental\r\npanels which they marshal and enclose. This staircase is\r\nnot to be ranked amongst the most brilliant examples of its class;\r\nbut I cite it because it is still in place, and represents, in a simple\r\nform, characteristics the most opposite to those which distinguish\r\nthe work of Lamour.\r\n\r\n\"Moins marchands qu'artistes, mais absolument confondus avec\r\nles marchands, sont les fondeurs, les modeleurs, les ciseleurs et les\r\n\u00e9mailleurs.\" These words, which apply also to the \"serrurier\"\r\nand his fellows, were written by M.

Every detail is corroborated by various\r\nwitnesses, so that we need only follow the lines of the simple story\r\nas told by the father of Philippe.[1]\r\n\r\nPhilippe was then twenty-four, but he was still a minor, for\r\nin those times majority was not attained until the age of twenty-five;\r\nhe had lived quietly with his family in the rue des Canettes,\r\nsubmissive and respectful, until, on an unlucky day, he made the\r\nacquaintance of the Silvestre. Then, the mother Silvestre, after\r\nhaving made sure that the young man might inherit a considerable\r\nfortune, and having found that he turned a deaf ear to her evil\r\ncounsels--being anchored in the habit of filial obedience--laid\r\nsiege to him, says his father, \"par une voye \u00e0 laquelle il est\r\ndifficile \u00e0 une jeunesse vive et bouillante de r\u00e9sister\"--that is to\r\nsay, she handed over her daughter to him with the consent of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe young lady had acquired a bad character even before\r\nPhilippe Caffieri came on the scene,[2] but although she seems to\r\nhave speedily made herself mistress, both of her lover and of the\r\nsituation, their relations were kept more or less secret for eighteen\r\nmonths. Not for a day did Philippe omit his visits, but his\r\nabsence from the rue des Canettes was always explained by the\r\npretence of attendance at the classes of the Academy. Finally\r\n(March, 1738), he boldly left his father's roof and took up his\r\nabode in the rue du Mail with the Silvestre family, in order that\r\nhe and the daughter might live together as man and wife. Not\r\ncontent with this assertion of his independence, and acting under\r\nthe inspiration of the mother Silvestre, \"dont l'intention secr\u00e8te,\"\r\nsays Jacques Caffieri, \"est de lier par le mariage un jeune homme\r\nde famille, n\u00e9 avec du bien, \u00e0 sa fille destitu\u00e9e d'honneur et de\r\nfortune,\" Philippe sent a \"religieux\" to announce to his father\r\nand mother that the Silvestre girl was six months gone with child\r\n\"du fait de luy Caffiery,\" in order to induce them to consent to\r\nan immediate marriage.\r\n\r\nThe information had an effect exactly contrary to that intended.\r\n\r\nfamily, and brought[** ??

They acted with promptitude, the law was on their\r\nside, and before long the rue du Mail was enlivened by the final\r\nscene of Philippe Caffieri's unlucky love affair. The opposite\r\nneighbour, a Mme. Mauban, who appears to have kept watch on\r\nthe house, as opposite neighbours are in duty bound to do, declares\r\nthat she was much astonished one April evening, to see \"des\r\narchers enlever led. s. Caffi\u00e9ry d'entre les bras de la demoiselle\r\nSilvestre.\" She is careful, also, to note that the young man was\r\nactually wearing a dressing gown made out of one which had\r\nbelonged to that young lady and had been altered to fit him.[1]\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the story. The documents preserved at the\r\nArchives Nationales omit to mention what became of the heroine\r\nof this sordid romance, and where the \"archers\" may have proceeded\r\nto carry the hero habited in her dressing gown. It cannot\r\nhave been pleasant to Philippe Caffieri to return to the bosom of\r\nhis family in such company and in such clothing: nor is it probable\r\nthat he readily accepted the inevitable, but his troubles have\r\nleft no further trace on the tables of the law, and after a decent\r\ninterval of years--7th February, 1747--he took to himself a wife,\r\nSuzanne Edm\u00e9e de Li\u00e9ge, with the full approval of his family and\r\nfriends.[2]\r\n\r\nOne of the strange features of Philippe's connection with the\r\nSilvestre family is that though they are said to have so successfully\r\nsequestered him--after he transferred himself to the rue du Mail,--that\r\nhis friends were unable to get at him, yet he continued to\r\nwork either with or for his father at Versailles. During the years\r\n1736 and 1738 Jacques Caffieri was there engaged on the \"petits\r\nCabinets et petits appartements du Roi,\"[3] and it is from Versailles,\r\nthat Philippe--having recently left his father's house--wrote to\r\nhis godmother--\"la femme H\u00e9lan, marchande-ling\u00e8re\"--to ask\r\nfor his baptismal certificate and order body linen on credit.[4] It\r\nseems, therefore, by no means unlikely that he was actually\r\n\r\n1 Guiffrey, \"Les Caffieri,\" p. 106.\r\n\r\n2 Sebastian Leclerc, son of the celebrated engraver, and Noel Hall\u00e9, both \"peintres\r\ndu roi,\" were present at the marriage.

This consisted, according to the \"Etat d'entrepreneurs\r\net artistes\" employed, in \"Bronze de chemin\u00e9es avec dorure, bronze\r\net dorure de bras de chemin\u00e9e.\"[2] Of these, we have now remaining\r\nthe decorations of the marble chimney-piece--which was\r\ndesigned by Verberckt together with two others in the same\r\napartment--in the \"chambre du Dauphin.\" The branch lights\r\nby which they were accompanied have disappeared, as, indeed, has\r\nmost of the ornament of this class with which Jacques Caffieri was\r\nconstantly occupied at Versailles during the earlier part of the\r\ncentury, but the bronzes of the chimney-piece are still intact, and\r\nexhibit a pure type of the \"style Louis XV.\" They remind us of\r\nthat proof of his powers as a sculptor which had been given when\r\n(1737) Jacques Caffieri executed his busts of the Baron de Besenval,[3]\r\none of which was, says the Abb\u00e9 de Fontenai, \"conserv\u00e9\r\ntr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cieusement dans son cabinet,\" by his son, long after\r\nthe father's death.[4] The rococo shell motive which obviously\r\noccupies the centre, is skilfully treated with lusty vigour, but the\r\ncharm of the whole work consists in the youth and grace of the\r\nfigures of Z\u00e9phire and Flore, who emerge from the flower-wreathed\r\nsheaths which are carried up against the supports of the mantel.[5]\r\nSo much of other decoration is still intact in the deserted room,\r\nthat, by the introduction of a few eighteenth century portraits,\r\nM. de Nolhac has been able almost to create the illusion of\r\noccupation. Especially happy is the hanging in this room of those\r\nof the two Dauphines and that of the Dauphin himself, painted\r\nby Nattier in 1747, the very year in which the prince came to\r\nsleep within these walls.[6]\r\n\r\nThe importance of this work--which seems to be the earliest\r\nto which we can refer as certainly executed by Jacques Caffieri--seems\r\nto have escaped even M. Molinier, who refers to it under\r\nthe date 1747[7] as \"de bras de lumi\u00e8re\"; but the branch lights\r\n\r\n1 De Nolhac, \"Le Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles sous Louis XV.,\" p. 20.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., p. 135.\r\n\r\n3 See \"French Architects and Sculptors,\" p. 117.\r\n\r\n4 \"Dictionnaire des Artistes.\"\r\n\r\n5 A more or less faithful reproduction of this chimney-piece is to be found at\r\nHertford House.\r\n\r\n6 De Nolhac, \"Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles sous Louis XV.,\" pp. 135, 146.\r\n\r\n7 \"Le Mobilier au XVII et XVIII Si\u00e8cle,\" p. 130.",

It is not improbable--so\r\ngreat was the irregularity of payment from which those employed\r\nby the Crown always suffered--that this work is in question when\r\nJacques Caffieri, in 1747, appeals for money to the \"Directeur des\r\nB\u00e2timents,\" for de Tournehem, in his reply, asks for a statement as\r\nto the works \"que vous av\u00e9s fourni pour Mesdames, M. le\r\nDauphin et Choisi pendant 1746.\"[1] In 1748, Jacques Caffieri\r\nwas told off to La Muette to execute repairs, and we are reminded\r\nby the \"journ\u00e9es employ\u00e9es \u00e0 raccommoder les portes de glaces\r\nentour\u00e9es de moulures de bronze dor\u00e9 des appartements du ch\u00e2teau\"\r\nof the \"bordures dor\u00e9es de glaces\" which he had executed in 1742,\r\nfrom designs furnished by Gabriel and one of the Slodtz.[2] These\r\nmirrors were intended, according to M. Paul Mantz,[3] as a present\r\nfrom the King to the Sultan. M. Mantz gives no authority for\r\nthis story, but nothing is more probable than that such gifts were\r\nsent by Louis XV., and, if so, it is not unlikely that they may be\r\nrecognized, one of these days, in some corner of that amazing\r\n\"capharna\u00fcm\" at Seraglio Point--magnificently named the\r\nImperial Treasury--where the most costly triumphs of art are\r\njostled by bowls of glass beads and bird-clocks whose machinery\r\nhas long been beyond repair.\r\n\r\nAfter the year in which the humble services of reparation\r\noccupied Jacques Caffieri at La Muette (1748), there comes a\r\nblank in the record of his activity as far as the Board of Works is\r\nconcerned. M. Guiffrey suggests that his powers were failing,\r\nyet he was certainly employed in 1750 by the express wish of the\r\nKing on the magnificent bronze case of the famous astronomical\r\nclock constructed by Passemant and Dauthiau,[4] which, after years\r\nof labour, was submitted to and approved by the Academy of\r\nSciences in August, 1749. It was taken to Choisy and presented\r\nto the King on 7th September, 1750, and Dauthiau tells us that\r\nthe shape of the present case was the choice of Louis XV.\r\nhimself, adding that it was designed and executed by \"le s^r\r\nCaffi\u00e9ri, ce qui a prolong\u00e9 le temps jusqu'au 20 Ao\u00fbt 1753,\r\n\r\n1 Guiffrey, \"Les Caffieri,\" p. 86.\r\n\r\n2 These drawings, which are preserved in the Print Room of the Biblioth\u00e8que\r\nNationale, have been reproduced by M. de Champeaux. See pl. 72 and 79, \"Portefeuille\r\ndes Arts d\u00e9coratifs.\"\r\n\r\n3 G. B. A., 1861, p. 257.\r\n\r\n4 The face bears the names of Passemant and Dauthiau: at the back of the movement\r\nwe find the inscription, \"Invent\u00e9e par Passemant; ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par Dauthiau,\r\nexamin\u00e9e et approuv\u00e9e par l'Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences de Paris, le 23 Aoust, 1749.\"",

If we look simply at its general outline, it justifies to\r\nsome extent the ridicule of those to whom it suggests the grotesque\r\nimage of a bandy-legged man without arms. Yet, though I\r\nam fully persuaded that the composition as a whole has a somewhat\r\nridiculous aspect, I never fall to examining this wonderful\r\npiece of work without forgetting all its absurdity in the admiration\r\ninspired by the skill and precision of the workmanship, and the\r\ngreat beauty of individual passages of design. What is lacking in\r\ngrace and elegance of outline, is compensated by the exhibition of\r\nmasterly craft and dexterity of a consummate excellence in its\r\nkind.[2]\r\n\r\nThe bronzes were no doubt signed, as M. Guiffrey concludes,\r\nby Jacques Caffieri alone. The inscriptions \"Les bronzes ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\r\npar Caffieri,\" and again, \"Les bronzes sont compos\u00e9s et\r\nex\u00e9cut\u00e9 (sic) par Caffieri,\" appear in two spaces dissimulated right\r\nand left of the face within the curving palm branches which form\r\na principal feature of the decoration. Yet it is equally certain that\r\nPhilippe had a large share in the production of the work, and\r\nalthough Dauthiau, writing when the old man was still alive, and\r\nstill at the head of the atelier of the rue des Canettes, dared only\r\nmention the one name, Philippe or Philippe's friends made haste\r\nto claim for him his due share of honour after his father's death.\r\nWhen Le Roy published his \"Etrennes Chronom\u00e9triques\" in\r\n1758, he is careful to explain in the chapter devoted to the\r\n\"pendule astronomique\" that the \"bo\u00ebte en bronze a \u00e9t\u00e9 compos\u00e9e\r\net ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par messieurs Caffi\u00e9ri p\u00e8re et fils.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn all the work carried out by Philippe Caffieri after 1754, he\r\nalways signs his name in full, adding sometimes \"l'a\u00een\u00e9,\" to distinguish\r\nhimself from his brother, Jean-Jacques the sculptor,[4] who,\r\n\r\n1 \"Mercure de France,\" March, 1754, pp. 174-178; ap. Guiffrey, \"Les Caffieri,\"\r\npp. 75, 76.\r\n\r\n2 Indications of the same power of, as it were, jointing discrepant parts of ornament\r\nmay be traced in the design for an embroidered pall which is preserved in the\r\nMus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique du Mans. It bears the inscription, \"Invent\u00e9 et dessin\u00e9 par\r\nJacques Caffieri 1715.\" It was executed for the guild of \"fondeurs-ciseleurs,\" of\r\nwhich he was a member, and is admirably reproduced by Guiffrey (p. 70). Every\r\nsort of emblem of the work of the fondeur-ciseleur from guns to cups is introduced\r\nafter a fashion that recalls the trade union silk handkerchiefs covered with steam-*engines\r\nand arabesques which are now supplied from Coventry.\r\n\r\n3 Apud Guiffrey, \"Les Caffieri,\" p. 75.\r\n\r\n4 See \"French Architects and Sculptors,\" pp. 116-124.",
  "241.png": "it is said, showed also special aptitude for ornamental design in\r\nmetal, and gave the sketch from which the serrurier Corbin carried\r\nout, under the direction of Contant d'Ivry, the fine \"Rampe\r\nd'Escalier,\" which is certainly the most remarkable bit of decorative\r\nart now left at the Palais Royal.[1] Fortunately this is the only\r\ninstance in which we find the name of Jean-Jacques connected with\r\nthe class of work in which his father and brother became famous,\r\nor a further element of confusion would be introduced into the\r\nalready difficult task of sifting attributions. For the present, there\r\nis more than sufficient occupation to be found in the attempt to\r\ndetermine the different shares of Philippe and his father in the\r\nwork that bears the family name. This work, when we come to\r\nthe mounting of furniture, forms a mass so enormous that it is\r\nimpossible to suppose that the whole of it proceeded from the\r\nsingle atelier of the rue des Canettes; rather shall we eventually\r\nhave to class a very large proportion as having been produced by\r\nimitators of a style which had in some sort been created and most\r\ncertainly rendered popular by the genius of the Caffieri.\r\n\r\nM. Guiffrey, to whom we owe the remarkable volume to\r\nwhich already frequent reference has been made, has collected all\r\navailable information concerning every member of the group and\r\nhas thus been the first to reveal the full importance of the part\r\nplayed by Jacques Caffieri. It is to him that, as M. Guiffrey has\r\nsuggested, we must attribute all work the style of which is obviously\r\nearlier than the date of his death--that is to say, all work that\r\nshows \"rocaille\" elements--as well as all that which is signed\r\n\"Caffi\u00e9ri.\"[2] This must lead us to accept, as one of Jacques\r\nCaffieri's most authentic achievements, the rather absurd \"Elephant\r\nClock\" of the Jones collection, which is inscribed \"Fait par\r\nCaffi\u00e9ry,\"[3] but, on the other hand certain fine works which have\r\nhitherto been carried to the account of Philippe must be restored\r\nto his father, or, at any rate, be regarded as their joint work.\r\nAmongst these, the magnificent commode in the Wallace collection\r\nshould take the first place. It shows to perfection the defects as well\r\nas the excellencies which specially characterize those fine decorative\r\nmodels which we are accustomed to group under the family name.\r\n\r\n1 In. g\u00e9n. Mon. civ. Paris, t. i., p. 121.\r\n\r\n2 \"Les Caffieri,\" pp. 96, 97.\r\n\r\n3 M. de Champeaux mentions another of similar character also signed, and\r\nseveral other works of no great importance. \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 144. See also\r\nMolinier, \"Le Mobilier au XVII et XVIII Si\u00e8cle,\" p. 134, note 1.

  "242.png": "\r\nIn all work executed by the father, as in that executed by him in\r\nconjunction with his son, we find the same amazing preponderance\r\ngiven to bronze mounts which should properly be but ornaments.\r\nWhen one looks at the famous \"Bureau de lacque noire,\" which\r\nbelongs to the Ministry of Justice, it always occurs to me that the\r\nwood plays but the humble part of the blue glass basin which the\r\nsilversmith slips into a filagree basket so that it may hold sifted\r\nsugar. Loss of the sense of construction was the nemesis certain\r\nto overtake men, who, prompted perhaps by their pride of m\u00e9tier,\r\ngave their whole strength to the decorative side of their work.\r\nEven in the lordly commode of the Wallace collection--which\r\nbears on one of the scrolls to the right the inscription, \"Fait par\r\nCaffieri\"--we miss something of that determining quality of\r\nstrength which is exemplified in the similar work by Charles\r\nCressent in the same collection. Exactly where the trained eye\r\nasks for some affirmation of central importance--a point strongly\r\nemphasized by Cressent--it is confused with wreathing branches\r\nand loops of arabesque by Caffieri.\r\n\r\nThe fiery, somewhat boisterous energy with which the splendid\r\nmounting of this great commode is handled makes, however, a\r\nglorious apology for any defects with which it may be reproached.\r\nThe sweep of the curving palm branches has a freedom, if not a\r\nmajesty of movement that is inspired with true Italian animation.\r\nThe \"style rocaille,\" for its adequate expression, requires, it must\r\nbe confessed, that faculty of bravura which is denied to the races\r\nof the north. Vulgar in the hands of a Spaniard, an Italian when\r\nhe handles what he has christened \"le Style J\u00e9suite,\" may even\r\ndeceive us, if but for the moment, as to the truth of the saying,\r\n\"Was die stille nicht wirkt, wirket die rauschende nie.\" He alone\r\ncan make us feel the magic that may lie in simple exuberance of\r\nlife. If we turn from the works of the Caffieri, to an example\r\nsuch as the famous \"M\u00e9dailler\" executed for Louis XV. on the\r\ndesigns of the brothers Slodtz,[1] which is now in the Cabinet des\r\nM\u00e9dailles, at the Bibioth\u00e8que Nationale, we see at once how\r\nblundering and heavy, in the application of this essentially Italian\r\n\r\n1 The post of dessinateur de la chambre et cabinet du roi was filled on the death of\r\nMeissonnier (1750), by Antoine-S\u00e9bastian Slodtz (1694-1754). He had a dash of\r\nItalian blood, being one of the thirteen children of S\u00e9bastian Slodtz--a sculptor from\r\nAntwerp, who was employed at Versailles--by the daughter of Domenico Cucci (see\r\nchap. iv., p. 71). The brother of Antoine-S\u00e9bastian, Paul-Ambroise, succeeded him\r\nin his official post, and was in turn succeeded by Ren\u00e9-Michel or Michel-Ange\r\nSlodtz (1705-1764). As S\u00e9bastian and Paul are usually coupled together and alluded\r\nto as \"les fr\u00e8res Slodtz\" (see M\u00e9m. Cochin, pp. 113-121), it is to be supposed that\r\nthey worked together. Examples of this kind of family collaboration were extremely",

It is indeed supposed that the design for the Wallace\r\ncommode had the same origin, as it presents close resemblance to\r\na sketch by one of the Slodtz reproduced by M. de Champeaux,\r\nin his \"Portefeuille des Arts D\u00e9coratifs;\"[1] but if so, then Jacques\r\nCaffieri used to the full that liberty of interpretation which enabled\r\nhim--like other great executants--to appropriate only such elements\r\nas those which lent themselves to treatment in his own sense. As\r\nthis commode is conspicuous--amongst furniture--for the rare distinction\r\nof his signature, one is led to suppose that the unsigned\r\nmounts of the various other works of a similar character--some\r\nof which bear the stamps of well-known cabinet makers--are in\r\nmany instances due to the skill of other ciseleurs-fondeurs, happy\r\nenough to be the successful imitators of their model.\r\n\r\nThe collection at Hertford House is exceptionally fortunate in\r\nthe possession of a second work on which the signature of Caffieri\r\ncan be read in full. This is the magnificent lustre bought by\r\nBaron Davillier at Modena. It had, it is said, been given by\r\nLouis XV., on the marriage of the Infant, Don Philip of Spain, to\r\nLouise-Elizabeth of France, and has a companion unsigned but\r\nscarcely less fine in sweep of line, though of more broken detail.\r\nBoth undoubtedly present features in common with those of a\r\nsmaller pair in the Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine, which have long been\r\nassigned to the same master. At Hertford House, also, may be\r\nnoticed the mounts of two Dresden vases, which are works typical\r\nof the best style of this date. The griffin heads of the handles\r\nrecall designs by Nicolas Pineau, or by Cressent, but they are quite\r\npossibly due to Jacques Caffieri.[2]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered, in dealing with unsigned\r\n\r\ncommon. A collection of their drawings, \"Recueil de dessins pour meubles et pour\r\nornements ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s en partie le surplus projett\u00e9,\" will be found in the Biblioth\u00e8que\r\nNationale. (Cabinet des Estampes.) Amongst these is a spirited mount for a\r\nvase signed \"Slodtz,\" in some ways absurd, but the dogs at the base well felt.\r\n\r\n1 M. de Champeaux also instances a smaller \"commode en laque,\" the mounts\r\nof which, closely resembling those of the Wallace commode, are signed. \"Le Meuble,\"\r\nt. ii., pp. 143, 144.\r\n\r\n2 Amongst unsigned mounts of fine character, attributed to \"Caffieri,\" we may\r\nreckon those--unfortunately regilt--of a commode stamped \"Joseph\" (No. 133), in the\r\nJones collection; those of a pair of commodes also stamped \"Joseph\"--the property of\r\nthe Duke of Leeds--sold at Christie's, for \u00a315,000, on June 28th, 1901. Those of\r\none of two commodes, in the collection of Mr. Massey-Mainwaring (No. 3144, Bethnal\r\nGreen), are said to be signed. M. Molinier accepts as \"le type le plus parfait du\r\ngenre\" (p. 134), the \"Grand Bureau et Serre-papiers\" of the Metternich collection.\r\nIt is certainly a matchless model of excess. It is reproduced by M. Molinier and also\r\nby M. de Champeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., pl. 43.",
  "246.png": "work, that the greatest caution is necessary. It was not the habit\r\nof these men to set their names on the marvels they created. Style,\r\ntoo, is no sure guide, for when there is a marked and ruling style\r\neveryone gets some touch of it, which masks personal style, so if\r\nwe begin to make attributions to this or that great name because\r\ncertain works present similarities of character, we run the risk at\r\nevery turn of being perplexed by difficulties of our own creation.\r\nWhen we come to the production by Oeben and Riesener of the\r\nfamous \"bureau du roi,\" we shall find how even the immense\r\nexperience of M. Guiffrey was betrayed into the conjecture that\r\nthe mounts were the work of Philippe Caffieri. It seemed clear\r\nthat there was no other than he just then capable of modelling and\r\nchiselling in equal perfection these noble \"sculptures en bronze,\"\r\nbut M. Sen\u00e9 finds, in family papers, accounts which show that their\r\nauthor was not Philippe Caffieri, but Duplessis, the \"fondeur du\r\nroi,\" who, in 1742, had executed the great braziers of gilt bronze\r\ngiven by Louis XV. to the Turkish ambassador.[1]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the fame of Philippe Caffieri we can appeal to\r\nsome few works which are incontestibly his, and amongst these\r\nthere are some which he has signed. It has been suggested that he\r\nremained to the last faithful to the traditions of his father's school:\r\nthis theory, which has found supporters,[2] cannot, I think, be maintained.\r\nThe girandoles, the flambeaux and branch-lights, \"par\r\nM. Caffieri,\" and the cabinet for shells which Philippe undoubtedly\r\nmounted for Oeben,[3] cannot be traced; the works\r\nwhich he executed, in 1760, for the High Altar of N\u00f4tre-Dame\r\ndisappeared during the Revolution,[4] but the Cross and Candlesticks,\r\nwhich were ordered of him in 1771 for Bayeux Cathedral,\r\n\r\n1 A bronze eagle for N\u00f4tre-Dame was also his work. (G. B. A., 1861, t. ii.,\r\np. 128.) Duplessis was attached (1745) to the manufactory of S\u00e8vres, gave his name\r\nto the \"Vase Duplessis,\" and became director about 1753. Wille writes (25th July,\r\n1759): \"M. Duplessis, directeur de la fabrique de porcelaines de S\u00e8vres m'a apport\u00e9\r\nune lettre de Vienne.\" A certain confusion has long existed--and is shared amongst\r\nothers by M. Davillier (\"Cab. du duc d'Aumont,\" pp. xxvi, xxvii)--between this\r\nDuplessis who was \"Sculpteur, Fondeur, Ciseleur et Doreur du roi,\" and his son\r\nJean-Claude-Thomas Duplessis. It was first suspected by M. E. Garnier (\"Bulletin\r\ndes Mus\u00e9es, t. i., p. 158), and has been but recently cleared up. (See Richard\r\nStettiner, \"Vincennes und S\u00e8vres,\" Jahrbuch der K. P. Kunstsammlungen, 1893,\r\np. 141, note 3.) The son is the \"fameux Ciseleur de Paris, bon dessinateur qui\r\ntravaille d'apr\u00e8s ses dessins,\" to whom the \"candelabres de bronze dor\u00e9 qui ornaient les\r\nangles du salon de M. de la Reyni\u00e8re,\" hitherto attributed to the father, must be\r\nrestored. The mounts of an \"Aigui\u00e8re en porcelaine celadon\" (Louvre) are\r\nattributed to the father. (See Molinier, \"Le Mobilier au XVII. et XVIII. Si\u00e8cle,\"\r\np. 135.)

There appears to be in the general treatment\r\na greater breadth of style than was actually popular; the\r\nadmirable modelling of the figures at the foot of the Cross speaks\r\nof most excellent craft, and we recognize in the graceful employment\r\nof the suspended garlands at the base, and even more in the\r\nsubtlety with which the ornament in low relief is treated, the\r\nfacility with which new elements have been absorbed.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Caffieri, although his name frequently figures in the\r\nCrown accounts up to within five years of his death, certainly\r\nworked much for private persons.[1] In the catalogue of the\r\ncollections of La Live de Jully, we find a great group of furniture\r\nby him, \"\u00e0 l'imitation des ouvrages du fameux Boule,\" and in the\r\nCabinet of the Duke d'Aumont were girandoles and branch lights,\r\n\r\nCaffieri to replace the magnificent set made in silver by Claude Ballin. The silver\r\nset were taken to the mint, in answer to an appeal from the King, in 1759, when the\r\nSeven Years' War had emptied the Treasury and reduced the government to bankruptcy.\r\nThe set made by Caffieri are mentioned by Gueffier (\"Curiosit\u00e9s de l'Eglise\r\nde Paris,\" 1763): \"Une grande croix de sept pieds trois pouces et six chandeliers de\r\nquatre pieds trois pouces, de bronze dor\u00e9, d'un travail admirable, faits par Philippe\r\nCaffi\u00e9ry, fameux sculpteur-ciseleur en 1760.\" All the documents connected with\r\nthe circumstances of the execution of the work have been published by M.

In every collection we are confronted by groups\r\nof work--such as the fine series of \"chenets\" exhibited by Sir\r\nRichard Wallace, in 1888, which may be his, but may with equal\r\nprobability be attributed to Forestier, to Gouthi\u00e8re's master,\r\nMartincourt,[1] or to Gouthi\u00e8re himself. Their character and beauty\r\nsuggest great names, but they bear none. Documents fail us when\r\nwe have the works; if we have the documents, the works are lost.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many lost works which we know to have been\r\nexecuted from the designs of Philippe Caffieri, special mention is\r\ndemanded by that costly \"toilette de Vermeil\" ordered for\r\n\"Madame la princesse des Asturies,\" on the 8th July, 1765.[2] In\r\nH\u00e9bert's \"Almanach pittoresque\" for 1780, this toilette is\r\nreckoned amongst the richest treasures of Paris, and is said to have\r\nbeen made from the designs of \"M.

His failure for the, at that date, enormous sum of\r\n2,400,000 lt., was ascribed to the spendthrift extravagance of his\r\nlife, which he vainly endeavoured to justify by explaining to\r\nMarigny that it was enforced by \"la d\u00e9cence et le respect dus\r\naux Grands que je re\u00e7evais chez moi par \u00e9tat.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIn the \"M\u00e9moire justificatif\" from which I quote, Germain\r\ntakes a very high tone, and reproaches Marigny with permitting\r\nthe destruction of a trade with the foreigner which amounted to\r\nthree millions a year, and had been handed on from father to son.\r\nHe asserts that his style of life was but the necessary result of the\r\n\r\n1 Martincourt was an active member of the Academy of St. Luke.

The mirror-frame from this set--of which a\r\nrepetition in silver made for the Empress Elizabeth exists at St.\r\nPetersburg--was exhibited by M. H. Schneider in 1888[1] and we\r\nthen learnt from M. Germain Bapst that it was chiselled by Leitz\r\nand gilt by Gouthi\u00e8re. The whole character of the design,\r\nespecially the treatment of the doves at the base of the frame in\r\nrelation to the main lines of ornament, shows how completely\r\nPhilippe Caffieri had assimilated novel elements of composition,\r\nand it is plain also that Germain would not have applied to him at\r\nthis date for the design of so important a service had there not been\r\nsome truth in the unfavourable reports concerning the claims he\r\nput forth continually as to his own powers.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, when he made a fresh attempt to regain his lodging\r\nin the Louvre, he seems still to have had some influence at Court,\r\nfor in order to maintain his disgrace, it was found necessary to\r\ndraw up a memorial of unrelenting severity to be placed \"sous les\r\n\r\n1 The entry in the catalogue is as follows: \"130^{ter} Grand cadre de glace en vermeil;\r\n\u00e0 la partie sup\u00e9rieure, les armes de la famille de Bragance avec la couronne\r\nroyale de Portugal, soutenues par deux amours: \u00e0 la partie centrale de la base, un bas-relief\r\nau repouss\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant deux colombes se b\u00e9quetant.

  "254.png": "yeux du roi.\" The advisers of Louis XVI. were more than\r\njustified by the writer of the memorial, who states that the talents\r\nof which Germain boasted were non-existent, that he had never\r\neven won the least little medal at the Academy, and that the pretence\r\nhe had contrived to keep up vanished with the fine collection\r\nof models bequeathed to him by his father, who was a man of real\r\nability.[1] It is, moreover, unkindly suggested that if Germain were\r\ntruly possessed of the sublime talents which he attributes to himself,\r\nthere is nothing to prevent him from turning them to account\r\nin the pay, and under the name of one of his whilom \"confr\u00e8res.\"\r\n\r\nIt so happens that Germain was then actually living with a\r\ngoldsmith named Dapch\u00e9,[2] in the rue de la Vannerie, and this\r\nremarkable name bears great likeness to that of a purchaser at the\r\nsale of the collections of the Duke d'Aumont in 1782, and one\r\nconjectures that Germain, unable to do anything on his own\r\naccount, made purchases, on commission, for his former patrons\r\nthrough the agency of his host Dapch\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThe employment of Philippe Caffieri to design a \"toilette\" of\r\nso costly and so modish a type in 1765 argues the transformation\r\nof his style. It is, I think, certain that had he not readily and\r\nintelligently followed the lines on which what was \"l'Art\r\nnouveau\" of his day developed, he would not have continued to\r\ncarry out even small work in the Royal palaces. The evidence\r\nthat he was so employed is to be found in the accounts of the\r\nBoard of Works. Large sums were already owing to him when,\r\nthree years after his father's death, his urgent appeals drew from\r\nMarigny, the brutal avowal of empty coffers contained in his letter\r\nof October 12th, 1758. \"Je connois,\" he writes, \"vos embarras,\r\nMonsieur, et je voudrois qu'il f\u00fbt possible de vous secourir....\r\nFaites de votre mieux ou ne faites point. Je ne pouray vous faire\r\ndes reproches sur des retardements dont la source est le deffaut\r\nd'argent, puisqu' [**del space?]encore je ne puis vous en faire donner.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt must be supposed that Philippe Caffieri did not dare to take\r\nthe angry injunction \"to do his best or let it alone\" literally--for\r\nthe work in question regarded \"un feu de bronze dor\u00e9 d'or moulu\"\r\nfor the h\u00f4tel of Marigny himself--but he continued to press for\r\nmoney, representing that he could not deliver \"les bras et le feu\r\n\r\n1 A. de l'A. fr., t. i., pp. 255, 256.\r\n\r\n2 In the illegible notes made by Gabriel de St. Aubin on the copy of the catalogue\r\nlent by Baron J\u00e9rome Pichon to Baron Davillier, the name is written \"Lachez.\"\r\nOrthography was not a strong point with St. Aubin, and M.

These were, as may be expected,\r\nonly obtained by his heirs after incessant solicitation.

As soon as the constraint of the days of Louis XIV. was\r\nrelaxed, men sought pleasure divested of pomp. Physical ease was\r\nthe first condition of enjoyment. Change in the shape of all furniture\r\nwas a necessity, and infinite was the variety of invention\r\ndisplayed in the making of fauteuils to receive the feather pillows\r\nwhich made the chair a seat of soft repose, and in the more convenient\r\narrangement of bureaux and desks and tables. The task of the\r\nartist was to give expression to these desires, and to find the lines\r\non which he could best follow out the luxurious leanings of the\r\nday. Just as the death of Le Brun ultimately set free the workers\r\nof Versailles to follow divergent and personal aims, even so the\r\nbreakdown of the system of royal workshops which had been\r\nerected by Colbert, tended to widen the play of individual fancy.\r\nThrough the failure of stringent direction, the field was left open\r\nto the action of competition, checked only by the continued pressure\r\nof tradition, but in certain cases that pressure maintained itself with\r\na force and continuity which bears irrefragable testimony to the\r\nvigour and sagacity of the original direction. In no case is this\r\nmore conspicuous than in the splendid work of Andr\u00e9-Charles\r\nBoulle.\r\n\r\nAt half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 30th of August,\r\n1720, the youngest son of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle[2] was roused from\r\nsleep by the voices of men shouting. He and his two brothers,\r\nstarting from their beds, looked out and saw tongues of flame,\r\nwhich, issuing from the workshops of Marteau,[3] \"entrepreneur de\r\nmenuiserie des b\u00e2timents du roi,\" had set fire to one of their\r\nfather's ateliers.\r\n\r\nThese ateliers were of vast extent.

Warehouses were packed with precious woods; in a\r\nlittle gallery near by were stored models in wax and clay and those\r\nplaster casts from the works of great masters which were constantly\r\nconsulted by Boulle and his assistants. There were also many\r\nthat were of their own design. In other warehouses stood all\r\nkinds of magnificent furniture, finished and unfinished, whilst\r\nin the rooms occupied by Boulle himself were his priceless collections:\r\ndrawings, medals, gems, engravings and other works of art,\r\namongst which were forty-eight drawings by Raphael, and that\r\nmanuscript journal kept by Rubens, during his travels in Italy\r\nand elsewhere, which contained his notes and studies on paintings\r\nand sculpture, copiously illustrated by pen-and-ink sketches.[1]\r\n\r\n\"All that could be done,\" says Boulle--in the memorial which\r\nhe drew up probably in the hope of obtaining some compensation\r\nfrom the King--\"was to bear away a few things near to hand, and--closely\r\nattacked by a violent and raging fire--one was forced to\r\nleave all else to the flames.\"[2] It may, indeed, be said without\r\nexaggeration that the fire which destroyed the ateliers and collections\r\nof Boulle was an irreparable calamity, not only to the man\r\nhimself, but to the whole civilised world. \"Nothing,\" writes\r\nMariette, \"was saved, in comparison with what was lost, and that\r\nwhich was saved was in itself prodigious.\" A sale took place,\r\nwhich lasted a long time (it began in March, 1732) at which the\r\n\"pitiful remains were exhibited of one of the finest collections that\r\nhas ever been made.\"\r\n\r\nAll his life long Boulle had sacrificed everything to his art and\r\nto his love of art.

By embarrassments\r\nthus created he was led into sordid disputes with tavern-keepers\r\nover the money due for the keep of those whom he employed--men\r\nfor whom he had been guarantee and from whose wages, it\r\nwas said, he had deducted the sums which he afterwards declined\r\nto pay.[2] His own workmen had to go to law with him to get\r\ntheir just due.[3] Even his wealthiest patrons were not exempt\r\nfrom the like vexations. Crozat le jeune, having ordered certain\r\npedestals for his Cabinet, advanced the money, but knowing\r\nBoulle's ways, took other furniture of him in pledge of the fulfilment\r\nof their agreement: the pedestals were not forthcoming on\r\nthe date agreed, neither were they of the dimensions agreed, but\r\nas soon as Crozat insisted on his rights Boulle set up a counter-*claim,\r\n\"dans lequel il prit plaisir de confondre et de demander le\r\npayement des ouvrages qu'il avoit donnez en nantissement au sieur\r\nCrozat pour l'argent qu'il luy a prest\u00e9.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIn the course of his \"M\u00e9moire,\" Crozat declares that he was\r\nresolved \"not to depend on the caprice of a workman who would\r\nnot deliver the work which had been ordered of him except at his\r\nown good pleasure\";--words which if they complete our knowledge\r\nof Boulle's character also remind us how much he had in\r\ncommon with a certain type of artist of whom there have been not\r\nundistinguished examples even in our own day. Of course on\r\nthis, as on other occasions, Boulle was condemned \"en tous ses\r\ndepens\"; his situation became more and more difficult; his\r\ncreditors more and more pressing, they even sought authority to\r\n\r\n1 A B C Dario, Mariette.\r\n\r\n2 See Henry Havard. \"Les Boulle,\" p. 71.\r\n\r\n3 See \"Sentence et arr\u00eat rendus contre Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle au profit de ses\r\nouvriers (1685).\" Documents communiqu\u00e9s et annot\u00e9s par M.

The patience of the King was, however, all\r\nbut exhausted, and we learn finally from a letter in the hand-*writing\r\nof Mansart--which should probably be dated 1704--that\r\nonce more the King has granted Boulle \"un arrest de surs\u00e9ance,\r\npour six mois, pour luy donner lieu d'acquitter le reste de ses\r\ncr\u00e9anciers, \u00e0 condition que ce sera la derni\u00e8re gr\u00e2ce que Sa Majest\u00e9\r\nluy fera l\u00e0 dessus.\"\r\n\r\nIt may seem out of place to write of Boulle in a volume\r\ndevoted to the work of the eighteenth century. The most splendid\r\nspecimens of his work are, it is true, associated with the days of\r\nLouis XIV., and their superb solidity of aspect and monumental\r\ncharacter are closely allied in style to the Versailles of Le Brun,\r\nbut there was no great and immediate change of style marked by\r\nthe close of the Grand Si\u00e8cle. The divisions by which we mark\r\noff lapses of time into centuries are highly artificial, and the\r\nchanges which took place at the close of the seventeenth century\r\nwere carried on gradually through the earlier years of the\r\neighteenth.\r\n\r\n\"Depuis Louis XIV.,\" as M. Molinier says, \"nous n'avons\r\npoint chang\u00e9 de meubles.\"[2] The evolution of our chests of drawers,\r\nour writing-tables and the somewhat later \"Cabinet\"--formed by\r\ningenious combinations of the chest and the trestles upon which\r\nit rested--was then accomplished: their construction has ever\r\nsince remained the same. The Court, and the world by which it\r\nwas surrounded, demanded incessant modifications of shape and\r\nornament, but whilst Paris required a change of style to match\r\nevery change of fashion, wealthy families in the provinces were\r\ncontent to repeat the models left them by previous generations.\r\nThis alone may lead us into frequent slips, for it is quite possible\r\nthat a work bearing every characteristic of the sculptural proportions\r\nand treatment of pure Louis XIV. style, may be, in reality,\r\nthe product of provincial artists, working for provincial patrons in\r\na later reign.\r\n\r\nEven as regards work executed in Paris, it is not always easy\r\nto speak with decision as to its exact date, nor can one say that\r\nBoulle, or any other of the admirable artists whose names have\r\ncome down to us, had a fixed and personal style. If they occasionally\r\ncarried out their own designs, they worked perhaps even\r\n\r\n1 \"Lettres relatives \u00e0 la Saisie pratiqu\u00e9e sur Boulle par ses cr\u00e9anciers.\" A. de\r\nl'A. fr., t. iv., pp. 332-333.\r\n\r\n2 \"Le Mobilier fran\u00e7ais au XVII. et XVIII.

Boulle certainly did not\r\nrestrict himself to his own inventions,[1] and his successors used a\r\nsimilar or even larger liberty.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the famous and magnificent type\r\nof furniture which was perfected by Boulle,[2] and to which he gave\r\nhis name, continued to be made throughout the eighteenth century\r\nby his sons and successors, and has never lost its high renown and\r\npopularity. \"After a hundred years,\" wrote Mariette, \"his\r\nbeautiful furniture is as perfect as when it left his hands.\" We\r\ncan scarcely endorse that handsome eulogy. Nothing was ever\r\nimagined less fit to stand the wear and tear of daily usage. The\r\ndivers materials of which the marquetry is composed do not easily\r\nresist the disintegrating effect of varying atmospheric conditions,\r\nand hardly a single piece has come down to us absolutely intact,\r\nthough many have preserved the magnificent appearance which\r\njustifies the great and persistent reputation of their maker.\r\n\r\nIf the main features of the art of the eighteenth century were\r\nits diversity and the extraordinary assemblage which it presents\r\nof varying tendencies and styles, there is, on the other hand, a\r\ncertain relation to be observed between works that are nearly of a\r\ndate. This helps us to bring some sort of sequence into the development\r\nof successive phases. The great \"Armoire\" in the\r\nLouvre, which is decorated with emblems of hunting and fishing;\r\nthe superb clock at the Imprimerie Nationale, or the noble commodes\r\nof the Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine, might be placed with admirable\r\npropriety in the \"Galerie dor\u00e9e\" of de Cotte, or in the\r\n\"Grand Salon\" of the Chancellerie d'Orl\u00e9ans, as created by\r\nBoffrand. In all these works, the fine ornaments in relief by\r\nwhich they are accompanied recall the school of Le Brun, and\r\nthe proud freedom of their character is not more remarkable than\r\ntheir perfect incorporation with the general aspect of the decoration.\r\n\r\n1 In the little gallery--which is supposed by M. Havard to have connected the\r\nworkshops with the lodgings occupied by Boulle--were \"toutes sortes de models de\r\nterre, cire, plastre, de la main des meilleurs sculpteurs: Michel Ange, Fran\u00e7ois\r\nFlamand, Girardon, Le Comte et autres; tous les models de cire et terre que le S^r\r\nBoulle a fait faire, depuis qu'il exerce la profession, lui et ses enfants;--Toutes les figures\r\nantiques en petit.\" A. de l'A. fr., t. iv., pp. 347, 348.\r\n\r\n2 The exact genealogy of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle is unknown, but he was probably\r\na relative of Pierre Boulle, \"tourneur et menuisier du roi,\" who had lodging in the\r\nLouvre and died about 1636. N. A., 1872, pp., 12, 13. In the marriage contract\r\nof Pierre Boulle with Marie Bahuche made at Lyons, he is said to be the\r\nson of the late \"David Boulle, en son vivant habitant et bourgeois de Verri\u00e8re, au\r\ncomt\u00e9 de Neufch\u00e2tel en Suisse.\" (See H. Stein, \"L'Eb\u00e9niste Boulle et les origines\r\nde sa famille.\" M\u00e9m. des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s des Beaux-Arts des d\u00e9partements, 1890). The\r\nfamily were protestant.

In the noble\r\nand most graceful writing-table, with its \"serre-papier,\" which is\r\nin the collection of M. Foulc, we find a lighter movement in the\r\noutline which demands a corresponding alleviation of weight in\r\nstructural surroundings. The beauty and grace of this charming\r\nwork--to which M. Foulc assigns the date of 1735, but which\r\nmight well be earlier--would find its fitting accompaniment in\r\nthe neighbourhood of such decoration as that of which we acknowledge\r\nthe supreme elegance in the rooms created by Boffrand at\r\nthe h\u00f4tel de Soubise.\r\n\r\nIf the quality of the sculptural ornament in this table recalls\r\nthe finest work of the \"Style R\u00e9gence,\" the inlaid patterns on the\r\ndrawers remind us how often the designs of Jean Berain were used,\r\nin late examples of Boulle, on the smaller scale to which they were\r\nbest adapted, as in the chest of drawers in the Morrison collection,\r\nof which I give an illustration. This class of work was, however,\r\nproduced not only by Boulle and by his sons, but also by his imitators.\r\n\r\nBoulle, it should be remembered, neither invented,[4] nor did he\r\nconfine himself to the production of the special class of marquetry\r\n\r\n1 Most of the works executed by Charles-Andr\u00e9 Boulle at Versailles, of which the\r\nmost noteworthy was the \"Cabinet du Dauphin,\" and its \"mobilier,\" and his works\r\nfor foreign princes: the King of Siam, Duke of Savoy, Duke of Lorraine, and others,\r\nhave disappeared.

In the \"Etat d'ouvrages de commande brusl\u00e9s et\r\np\u00e9ris,\" drawn up after the fire of August, 1720, we find mention\r\nof works \"en marquetterie de bois violet et autres couleurs, orn\u00e9es\r\nde bronzes,\" as of those \"en marquetterie d'\u00e9caille de tort\u00fce et de\r\ncuivre,\"[2] to which he owes his world-wide fame.[3]\r\n\r\nThere is, unfortunately, infinite doubt as to how much of the\r\nwork that goes by his name is really his. The task of separating\r\nthat which is really by Boulle from that which was produced by\r\nhis contemporaries and from the imitations of a later date, is\r\nrendered all the more difficult because the most celebrated of his\r\nachievements have disappeared, and because the imitations are\r\nsometimes so excellent. The popularity of his magnificent marquetry\r\nbrought forth many skilful imitators. When those whom\r\nhe had himself trained, had passed away, their place was occupied\r\nin the later years of the century by Levasseur, Montigny and Jacob.\r\nLouis XVI. himself ordered repetitions by the two last of the\r\n\"m\u00e9daillers de Louis XIV.,\" and if these works, most of which\r\nare now in the Garde-Meuble, did not actually bear the stamps of\r\ntheir makers, they would probably be passing--as does similar\r\nwork in the collections at Windsor--as by the great Boulle.[4] It\r\nwill only be by the exercise of the utmost severity, by rejecting\r\nall works except those whose history is known, and by the help of\r\ncertain descriptions which may enable us to identify existing\r\nexamples, that we can hope to realize what a set of furniture, such\r\nas that executed by this famous cabinet-maker for the Dauphin, was\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nThe sons of Boulle imitated only too closely their father's life\r\nof embarrassment ending in a miserable death.

This done, when the sheets\r\nare detached, one has in hand--should copper and inlaying tortoiseshell have been\r\nemployed--two decorative patterns and two grounds for inlaying--that is to say the\r\nsheets of shell or copper out of which the patterns have been cut. The next step is\r\nto insert the copper pattern in the shell ground, and the shell pattern in the copper\r\nground. Two panels are thus obtained, totally different in aspect, but absolutely alike\r\nin pattern.

Molinier, \"before 1690, was dead before 1741, his affairs\r\nbeing in a bad state.\"[2] That his affairs were in a bad state there\r\nis no manner of doubt, but he was certainly alive in 1741, for he\r\nthen figured with his brothers, Andr\u00e9-Charles and Charles-Joseph,\r\nas the heir of Pierre-Beno\u00eet, then lying dead in a room on the fifth\r\nfloor of the house of a S^r. Moreau, \"marchand de bois,\" in the\r\n\"grande rue du Faubourg St. Antoine.\" Four years later when\r\nthe same ceremony was repeated on the death of Andr\u00e9-Charles\r\nBoulle de S\u00e8ve, Jean-Philippe does not appear,--he must, therefore,\r\nhave died at some time between 1741 and 1745.\r\n\r\nNo tragic element is wanting to the last hours of Andr\u00e9-Charles,\r\nwho is supposed to have inherited with his name something\r\nmore of his father's talent than passed to either of his\r\nbrothers. As, however, it is quite impossible to distinguish his\r\nwork from theirs, this more excellent reputation is probably due\r\nto the fact that the few details of which we are in possession as to\r\nhis life are of a less sordid character than those handed down to us\r\nabout his brothers. The most we know of Jean-Philippe is that\r\nhe lay in prison for debt at Fontainebleau and was released on the\r\nmarriage of Louis XV. and Marie-Leczinska;[3] Pierre-Beno\u00eet\r\nmarried a woman who could not even sign her name, but was\r\ncareful to exclude \"communaut\u00e9 de biens\" from her marriage-contract;[4]\r\nCharles-Joseph was the object of the most scandalous\r\naccusations on the part of the \"traiteur\" in the rue Fromenteau\r\nover a disputed account for food.[5] Andr\u00e9-Charles, on the other\r\n\r\n1 The \"Brevet de logement aux galeries du Louvre pour Jean-Philippe et Charles-Joseph\r\nBoulle fr\u00e8res, \u00e9benistes[** \u00e9b\u00e9nistes above], cizeleurs et doreurs pour Sa Majest\u00e9, en survivance de\r\nAndr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, leur p\u00e8re avec qui ils habitent,\" bears date 29 May, 1725.\r\nN.

As to himself, he says that his\r\ntalent \"pour les mod\u00e8les\" soon attracted the attention of all good\r\njudges, even of S. A. R. M. the late Duke of Orleans, who\r\nappointed him his \"\u00e9beniste\" in order to secure his services.\r\n\r\nThe pretensions of Cressent were not limited to his own art,\r\nfor he goes on to claim the credit of an expert advising the\r\nRegent, over and over again, as to the purchase of the valuable\r\npaintings submitted to him by \"MM. Crozat et de la Chateigneraye.\"[2]\r\nIf he were somewhat vain-glorious, Cressent could at\r\nleast point to his work as justifying by its excellence any praise\r\nwhich he might choose to give it, for though the epithet \"modeste\"\r\nkindly applied to him by M. Guiffrey is not precisely that which\r\nappears to have been deserved, he undoubtedly is one of those\r\nwhose names have been too long overlooked and who exercised\r\non the taste and art of his day \"the happiest and most direct\r\ninfluence.\" Nor should it be forgotten that his age, even when\r\nhe made his first sale, gave him the right to speak with authority.\r\nIn 1749, when the catalogue was issued in which he asserts his\r\nown claims and those of his father, the old sculpteur du roy,[3] to\r\nmore than honourable consideration, Cressent himself was considerably\r\nover sixty, and his father, in common with whom he\r\nhad, two years earlier, taken the lease of two houses in the rue\r\nJoquelet,[4] must have been--if then alive--aged eighty-five. These\r\ncircumstances are the apology both for the proud tenderness with\r\nwhich Cressent acknowledges his debt to his father and for the\r\nconfidence with which he points to his own achievements.\r\n\r\n1 His father, Fran\u00e7ois Cressent, was a \"Sculpteur du roi,\" and son of Charles Cressent,\r\nma\u00eetre-menuisier, at Amiens, who became a sculptor. Work by him is still\r\nextant in the \"h\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" at Amiens and in the Cathedral of Abbeville. By his\r\nwife, Marie-Madeleine Bocquet, he had two sons, of whom Charles Cressent was the\r\nsecond; the elder Fran\u00e7ois was born in 1684. See documents collected at Amiens by\r\nM. Dubois, furnished to M. de Champeaux by M. Duthuit, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 123.\r\nSee also Paul Mantz, \"Revue des Arts d\u00e9coratifs,\" April, 1884.\r\n\r\n2 N.A., 1884, pp. 413, 414, and Molinier, p. 102.\r\n\r\n3 N.A., 1884, p. 423.\r\n\r\n4 The details of the lease point to the acquisition of a \"site\" such as that occupied\r\nby Verberckt, in the rue Basse du Rempart, which would admit of the separate dwelling-house\r\naffording free access to the business premises. The owners declare that they\r\nhave \"solidairement baill\u00e9 et d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de bail \u00e0 vie aud. feu s. Charles Cressent,\r\net au s.

  "274.png": "\r\nHis qualification as an \"\u00e9b\u00e9niste,\" even when attached to a\r\nRoyal Household, was insufficient to cover the activity of a man\r\nso highly trained and variously endowed. From his sale catalogues\r\nwe learn that he was the author of important works of\r\nsculpture. He had not only repaired works by Girardon, by one\r\nof the Anguier and by Le Lorrain, but twelve great bronze\r\nmedallions of the C\u00e6sars figure in his last sale, and he executed\r\na bronze bust of Louis, duke of Orl\u00e9ans, the son of the Regent,\r\nwho died at the Abbey of Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve in 1752, leaving there\r\nthe noble m\u00e9dailler made for him by Cressent--a miracle of\r\ncabinet-making, carried out in most beautiful proportions,\r\nwhich now belongs to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. It was exhibited\r\nlast year at the Petit Palais,[1] minus the bust by which it\r\nshould have been crowned, and which has been, it is to be feared,\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence of his early training, Cressent was\r\ninclined to give considerable importance to the bronze appliques\r\non his cabinets and tables, but he nearly always employs them\r\nwith a discretion which leaves nothing to be desired. If he may\r\nbe said to have continued the \"Style Louis XIV.,\" he must also\r\nbe allowed to have developed it on lines of moderation and refinement,[2]\r\nwhich gave an unknown distinction to forms and details\r\nwhich, in themselves, were nothing new. The flat gravity of the\r\nsurface of his cabinets and the challenge to a more lively accent\r\nin the forms of his chests and his tables, recall precisely the habit\r\nof Boulle. The construction of the tables is invariably marked by\r\na feature which slowly disappears as the years pass, I mean the\r\nprojection of the two sides beyond the centre, so that the middle\r\ndrawer is, as it were, slightly recessed. Sometimes, as in tables\r\nof the \"Epoque de la R\u00e9gence,\" such as that exhibited by M.\r\nChappey at the Petit Palais, this projection is emphatically outlined\r\nby powerful whorls of acanthus leaves in bronze, and then,\r\nas in the very fine table from the Angerstein collection, now at\r\nthe South Kensington Museum, we are reminded of the earlier\r\nconstruction by the upward curve of the line in the centre outlined\r\nonly by a flat ornament which marks the place previously\r\ntaken by the vigorous movement of the high relief.\r\n\r\n1 See the \"Catalogue Illustr\u00e9 Officiel,\" No. 2911.\r\n\r\n2 The \"Cartel\" attributed to him (No. 2925, Petit Palais) and lent to the\r\nExhibition by the Town of Marseilles, appears as a freak amongst his other\r\nwork. There is a repetition of equal excellence at Hertford House. The headlong\r\nfall of Time beneath the menace of the little Love who surmounts the\r\nclock, the rocks, shell-forms, tree-branches, etc., are treated with a monstrous\r\ncleverness.",

  "277.png": "\r\nThe influence of de Cotte and of Oppenord has been often\r\ncited as governing the development of Charles Cressent's choice\r\nin the selection of constructive forms, whilst to Audran, Gillot,\r\nand Watteau is accorded an equal responsibility for his selection\r\nof and treatment of subjects for decoration. In the graceful little\r\nbronze groups of Loves, modelled with rare delicacy and distinction,\r\nwhich are discreetly applied on the panels of two large\r\nrosewood wardrobes,[1] we may trace a certain analogy with the\r\ngroups sculptured by Verberckt on the panels of the Cabinet de\r\nla Pendule, which brings before us the question of the great\r\ncomplexity of Cressent's tendencies. The quiet distinction of\r\nthese two works, which justifies our ranking them with the\r\nbeautiful m\u00e9dailler of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, is not more\r\nforeign to the powerful bravura with which Cressent handled\r\nthe Wallace commode and the \"Cartels\" at Hertford House, and\r\nat the Town Hall of Marseilles,[2] than is this spirit to the grotesque\r\nfancy displayed by him in the decoration of the panels of two\r\ncabinets now, I think, in the possession of Sir John Murray\r\nScott.\r\n\r\nWhen I came across these works at Bagatelle a few years ago,\r\nand saw these panels--which might have been modelled from a\r\nsketch made by Christopher Huet for the \"Petite Singerie\" at\r\nChantilly--I found a singular, if not intentional appropriateness\r\nin their situation. The principal subject, the ape delicately\r\ndancing on the tight-rope to the music of another monkey,\r\nirresistibly recalled the achievements of the prince for whom\r\nBagatelle was built. It seemed as if a delightful irony had\r\npresided at the purchase and installation in the pleasure house\r\nof the Count d'Artois of these cabinets decorated with scenes\r\nwhich might serve as a memorial of the time he devoted to lessons\r\non the tight-rope and of his performances before his sister-in-law,\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\n1 In the \"Catalogue des effets curieux du cabinet de feu M. de Selle, tr\u00e9sorier-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\r\nde la marine, etc., etc., par Pierre Remy, Paris, chez Didot l'ain\u00e9, 1761,\"\r\nthese wardrobes are thus described: \"No. 148.

Chappey.\r\n\r\n2 See Note 2, p. 156.",
  "278.png": "\r\nWith these wardrobes must be grouped, as showing the same\r\ninfluence, the two commodes now the property of Miss Alice de\r\nRothschild, which are decorated with bronzes of children swinging\r\na monkey. These commodes are of unquestioned authenticity, for\r\nthey figured in the Catalogue[1] sent out by Cressent on the occasion\r\nof his first sale. Their connection in point of style with the\r\nwardrobes of M. Chappey is evident, but I confess I cannot detect\r\nthe style of Watteau in the treatment of the figures at the corners\r\nof the writing table formerly at the Ministry of Marine,[2] which\r\nrepresent the four quarters of the globe, and have been repeated\r\nby Cressent on other examples of his work. I am not certain\r\nthat the noble table at the head of the stairs at Hertford House--which\r\nbears no stamp, but which is labelled \"Style R\u00e9gence\" by\r\nMr. Claude Phillips--is not the finest example of what may with\r\nas much propriety be called \"Style Cressent.\" The lines--like\r\nthose of another equally fine bureau in that part of the Wallace\r\ncollection which remains at the rue Lafitte--are simple, and\r\nhave a dignified beauty of which the famous table now at the Elys\u00e9e\r\nis deprived by certain restless curves to right and left of the centre\r\ndrawer. Of the same type too--though less elaborate and lacking\r\nthe heroic heads which give a very noble character to the bronze\r\ndecorations of the table at Hertford House--is that admirable one\r\nto which I have already referred, which is one of the finest\r\nthings in the Jones bequest at South Kensington. It bears the\r\nstamp of \"Petit,\" and although there were at least five \u00e9b\u00e9nistes\r\nof that name during the century, there can be no hesitation in\r\nattributing this fine work to Gilles, who stands first on the list\r\nas received into the corporation of which they were all members,[3]\r\nfor its style is strongly reminiscent of earlier work.\r\n\r\nDetails in the decoration of these various tables--whorls of\r\nacanthus leaves or close-knit curves of the palm--are of course to\r\nbe recognized in other work of the same date even if they have a\r\nrather different accent, but I never go into the H\u00f4tel de Soubise\r\nwithout feeling that the rooms of the prince's apartment, and still\r\nmore those of the apartment of the princess, are the proper home\r\n\r\n1 In No. 7 of the Catalogue of the first sale by Cressent of works by him, these\r\ncommodes are thus described: \"Deux commodes d'un contour extraordinaire \u00e0 toutes\r\ncelles qui se sont faites jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, avec deux portes par les c\u00f4t\u00e9s, enrichies d'ornemens\r\nen bronzes.

  "279.png": "of much of Cressent's most beautiful furniture. If we may trace\r\nthe influence of Oppenord and the decorative elements of the\r\n\"Style rocaille\" in the Wallace commode and in the \"Cartel,\"\r\nwhich has its double at Marseilles, we may none the less surely\r\npoint to the affinity existing between the finest decorations designed\r\nby Boffrand and certain examples of Cressent's most brilliant craft.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, the sentiment of Boffrand's decorations--which\r\nare the finest expression of true French courtly elegance--is\r\nbrutally opposed by the weighty character of the Empire show-*cases\r\nwhich disfigure the bedchamber of the princess and her\r\n\"Salon Ovale.\" Nothing could be less in keeping with the style of\r\neither of these rooms than the construction and ornament of these\r\nworks, the presence of which it is impossible not to resent when\r\nthe eye instinctively demands the sober elegance and distinction\r\nby which we are impressed in the most typical achievements of\r\nCharles Cressent and his imitators in the m\u00e9dailler of the Biblioth\u00e8que\r\nNationale and the wardrobes exhibited by M. Chappey.\r\n\r\nNo finer example of intelligent employment of bronze decoration\r\nwith intentional relation to points of construction can be\r\nfound than is presented by the mounts applied by Cressent to this\r\nm\u00e9dailler and these wardrobes. Their beauty is evidently the\r\nresult of serious studies in every subject connected with his craft.\r\nThe science of the architect is no less conspicuous than the art of\r\nthe sculptor, and looking at the exquisite accord which reigns in\r\nevery instance throughout the work, and the perfect fusion of the\r\ndetails, it is impossible not to sympathize with that reluctance to\r\nallow hands other than his own to interfere between him and his\r\ncreations which brought Cressent more than once into difficulties\r\nwith the guild of \"fondeurs ciseleurs.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe fact that Cressent not only modelled but would fain have\r\ncast and finished his bronzes himself, has led to a persistent legend\r\nwhich connects his name with a stamp that unfortunately is to be\r\nfound not only on work of various styles, but on work of various\r\nepochs. This consists of a double C, crowned by a fleur de lis,\r\nand it offers an irresistible temptation to read into it the name of\r\nCharles Cressent and the mark of his connection with a royal\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n1 Twice over, in 1723 and 1743, Cressent was called to account by the ma\u00eetres-fondeurs\r\nfor breach of their regulations. The \"sentence de police\" of 29 March,\r\n1743, condemns \"Charles Cressent ma\u00eetre-\u00e9b\u00e9niste et Jacques Confesseur ma\u00eetre\r\nfondeur.\" This mention of Confesseur is specially interesting, as he had worked for\r\nBoulle, and we find in the proc\u00e8s-verbal of his scell\u00e9, \"9^e opposition, De Jacques Confesseur,\r\nm^e fondeur, petite rue Taranne.\" (N.A., 1884, p. 84). See also de Champeaux,\r\n\"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 129, and Molinier, \"Le Mobilier, etc.,\" p. 103.",
  "280.png": "\r\nQuite recently, M. Anatole France has given fresh currency to\r\nthis too happy conjecture in his \"M. Bergeret \u00e0 Paris,\" where we\r\nfind the \"Inspecteur des Beaux Arts, Fr\u00e9mont\"--\"qui fr\u00e9quentait\r\nassidument les juifs riches, gardiens des tr\u00e9sors de l'art chr\u00e9tien\"--breakfasting\r\nwith one of these, from whom he solicits contributions\r\nfor the exhibition organized at the Petit Palais, by M. Emile\r\nMolinier.\r\n\r\n\"Envoyez au Petit Palais,\" says Fr\u00e9mont, \"votre meuble de\r\nRiesener, d\u00e9cor\u00e9 de s\u00e8vres en p\u00e2te tendre.

Ce sera \u00e9blouissant!...\" At this point\r\nFr\u00e9mont's attribution to Caffieri is corrected by another guest, the\r\nbaron Davant, himself an expert: \"Ces montures, dit il avec un\r\nton de sagesse attrist\u00e9e, ne sont pas de Philippe Caffieri. Elles\r\nsont marqu\u00e9es d'un C surmont\u00e9 d'une fleur de lis. C'est la marque\r\nde Cressent. On peut l'ignorer. Mais il ne faut pas dire le\r\ncontraire.\"[1]\r\n\r\nOf the C in question--when crowned by the fleur de lis--there\r\nare invariably two, one reversed towards the other. I have,\r\nhowever, seen the same letter applied singly on the back of a\r\nbronze, but then the crown or flower which accompanies the\r\nmonogram was absent. In any case, it seems certain that these\r\nmarks are simply \"poin\u00e7ons\"--trade marks which have nothing\r\nto do with the authorship of the bronzes on which they may be\r\nfound. This is the less to be regretted in the case of Cressent,\r\nsince not only do we possess certain pieces which bear his name,\r\nbut others have been identified through the minute details given\r\nin his catalogue and in that of M. de Selle. The exact accuracy\r\nof these descriptions should facilitate the accomplishment of something\r\nlike a complete classification of all his most important\r\nworks, and should go far toward the vindication of the claims\r\nwhich he put forth on his own account.\r\n\r\nThe odd little personal details revealed by his \"Scell\u00e9\" do not\r\nhelp us much to realize his character or his tastes. We learn that he\r\nloved scarlet and wore fine waistcoats of that colour enriched with\r\ngold embroidery or gold buttons; that his coats were of \"drap\r\nmordor\u00e9,\" and his overcoat was red. He was unmarried, and there\r\nis a certain suggestion of scandal in the fact that the person who\r\nruled his house, and to whose authority debtors and creditors alike\r\n\r\n1 \"M.

He was working probably in\r\nsome connection with Charles-Joseph, since there were in Oeben's\r\napartment many portraits, busts, tools and utensils which were\r\nthe property of his landlord.[2] His name, nevertheless, occurs\r\npretty frequently, at about this date, in the Livre-Journal of\r\nLazare Duvaux, as being employed on more or less delicate work\r\nfor Mme. de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nThe curious \"day ledger\" in which the chief jeweller and\r\ndealer of the day inscribed his orders, enables us to follow from\r\n1748 to 1759 the \"mouvement de la curiosit\u00e9\"--then at its\r\nheight--in the accounts of the great persons who were his\r\ncustomers.

The limit of his tasks, at least in May and\r\nJune, 1752, appears to have been the mending of tables for Cr\u00e9cy\r\nand Bellevue and the framing of various engravings.[2] We are also\r\nreminded that the marquise supplied to her \"\u00e9b\u00e9nistes\" the woods\r\nwhich she especially admired and which she bought \"en grume,\"\r\nby the entry of an order for seven \"bordures ... en bois d'amaranthe\r\nencrust\u00e9 \u00e0 fleurs\"--a class of work in which not only Oeben,\r\nbut Riesener, his pupil and successor, was superlatively excellent.\r\n\r\nIn 1752, when Oeben took these orders, it is to be supposed\r\nthat he was living in the Louvre as pupil or tenant of Charles-Joseph\r\nBoulle. His occupation of the rooms let to him having\r\nbeen terminated by the death of his friend, Oeben was at once\r\nprovided for--most probably through the intervention of the\r\nmarquise--and a \"brevet de logement \u00e0 la manufacture royale\r\ndes Gobelins pour Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Oeben, \u00e9b\u00e9niste, \u00e9l\u00e8ve de Boulle\"\r\nis dated 15th December, 1754.[3] Here, Oeben seems to have\r\ncarried on his business for some years, until, in 1760, he and his\r\nwife received a grant from the King--\"Sa Majest\u00e9, voulant\r\ntraiter favourablement le nomm\u00e9 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Oeben, \u00e9b\u00e9niste\r\nde profession, et son \u00e9pouse\"--of the lodging, consisting of two\r\nbig rooms and an entresol, in the new building at the Paris\r\nArsenal, of which they were actually in possession. In addition\r\nto this concession, which they could, on no pretext, let or grant\r\nto anyone else, they received a grant of ground for a forge.[4] A\r\nfurther grant of ground for \"des angars\" was made in the\r\nfollowing year.[5]\r\n\r\nAlthough established at the Arsenal with forge and \"angars,\"\r\n\r\n1 Courajod, \"Livre-Journal Duvaux,\" t. i., p. v.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., t. ii., Nos. 1119, 1138, 1140, 1161, 1204, 1404.\r\n\r\n3 N.A., 1873, p. 108.\r\n\r\n4 N.A., 1878, pp. 336, 337.

That he had for so long escaped this obligation points\r\nto the fact of his being a foreigner enjoying, on account of his\r\nskill, the exceptional protection of the Crown, and the conjecture\r\nthat the family were of Flemish or of German origin is strengthened\r\nby the pedigree of Oeben's wife, Fran\u00e7oise-Marguerite Van der\r\nCruse, who was the daughter of Roger Van der Cruse, himself an\r\n\u00e9b\u00e9niste of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and most certainly a\r\nFleming bred, if not born.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is more than likely that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Oeben had a brother\r\nor some other member of his family working with or for him\r\nwhom he was able eventually to establish on his own account and\r\nto whom he ceded one of his \"lodgings.\" We find, indeed, as\r\nlate as 1772, when Jean-Fran\u00e7ois had been many years in his\r\ngrave, that there was still an \u00e9b\u00e9niste called \"Hobenne\" inhabiting\r\nthe Gobelins,[2] whilst a \"Veuve Hobenne\" continued to keep\r\nshop at the Arsenal. The latter had for some time past been\r\nmarried to her husband's foreman, Jean-Henri Riesener, but the\r\ncredit of the old name it must be supposed was such that it had\r\nto be kept up for the sake of business. It is at any rate quite\r\ncertain that there were two Oeben, and that little as we know of\r\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois, we know still less of Simon, who has put his stamp\r\non the big bureau of the Jones bequest at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nIn the same collection we find also a pair of corner cupboards,\r\nstamped \"J. F. Oeben,\" which are admirably typical specimens\r\nof the kind of work for which their maker was most famous, and\r\nrepresent his title to popular credit even better than do the two\r\nspecimens (a chiffonier and bureau) equally authentic which are\r\npreserved in the Garde-Meuble. All the woods which were then\r\nmost frequently employed, \"bois d'amaranthe,\" or purple wood,\r\ntulip and rosewood, laburnum and maple, are here to be detected\r\nin the bouquets of flowers by which the centre panels are inlaid,\r\nand the grace of the design--the grouping of the half-blown roses\r\nand sprays of other and lighter blossoms bound together by floating\r\nknots of ribband--is set off by the extreme quiet of the diaper patterns\r\nby which the panels are enframed on either side.[3] The sobriety\r\n\r\n1 De Champeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 155.\r\n\r\n2 See \"Tablettes royales de Renomm\u00e9e, 1772.\" N.A., 1878, pp. 319, 320.\r\n\r\n3 This treatment of the centre panel and sides is often insisted on as specially\r\ncharacteristic of Riesener (see F.

The list of advances shows that considerable sums\r\nhad been paid to Duplessis, who modelled the mounts, and to\r\nHervieu, who cast and chased them, when the contract between\r\nMme. Oeben and Riesener was signed in the second half of 1767.\r\nBoth these men, whose names have been thus fortunately preserved,\r\nare known to us otherwise than in connection with their work on\r\nthe famous bureau. Duplessis, as we have seen,[2] was attached to\r\nthe manufactory of S\u00e8vres, and was much employed by Voyer\r\nd'Argenson and by Marigny; but, though his name constantly\r\noccurs in the \"Livre-Journal\" of Lazare Duvaux, it is invariably\r\nin connection with the mounting of ornamental objects such as\r\nthe vases to which he gave his name.[3] The character of Hervieu's\r\nbrilliant finish is so marked that his hand has been held to be\r\nrecognisable in other work, such as the fine bronze mounts of the\r\ngreat bureau exhibited by the Count Lafond in 1888.[4]\r\n\r\n1 This list runs thus: \"Pay\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

Charles S\u00e9n\u00e9--himself a descendant of the\r\nadmirable \u00e9b\u00e9niste, J. B. S\u00e9n\u00e9--showed that the credit for the\r\nconception of the work was certainly due to Oeben. In brief, his\r\ncontention was that a work so perfect could not have been produced\r\nwithout elaborate calculations and the making of models,\r\nafter the which preliminaries, something like three years must\r\nhave been occupied in the execution: three years were, indeed,\r\nrequired for the completion of the copy made for Lord Hertford\r\nby M. Dasson, which is now at Hertford House, in spite of the\r\nfact that minute division of labour facilitates in our day rapidity of\r\nproduction.[1]\r\n\r\nThe conclusious[** conclusions] deduced by M. S\u00e9n\u00e9 were triumphantly\r\nconfirmed eight years later, when M. Germain Bapst published\r\nin the \"Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Antiquaires\"[2] the \"M\u00e9moire\r\nd\u00e9taill\u00e9 des ouvrages fait pour la perfection du bureau fait pour Sa\r\nMajest\u00e9, sous les ordres de M. le chevalier de Fontanieu, controlleur\r\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ral des garde-meubles de la couronne, par Riesener, \u00e9b\u00e9niste\r\ndu roy \u00e0 l'Arsenal, livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Versailles en may 1769.\"[3] As M. S\u00e9n\u00e9\r\nhad foreseen, a miniature model had first been made, with perfect\r\nwax reproductions of all the bronzes, flowers, figures and other\r\nornament; even the semblance of the marquetry and different\r\npatterns of the wood was elaborately carried out in colour. Drawings\r\nin perspective showing the effect of the bureau from every\r\nside, were followed up by the construction of a \"b\u00e2ty en grand\r\nde bois de Vaulge,\" and even this had to be done with infinite pains\r\nso that it might be set up and taken to pieces, whilst the work of\r\ncompleting the project as regarded the ornaments was carried\r\nthrough. This, indeed, was no light task, for they were all again\r\nmodelled in wax at their full size to be applied exactly as they\r\nwere ultimately intended to be in bronze and in the course of this\r\npart of the work various changes and improvements were undertaken.\r\nIt was not until all these elaborate preparations were\r\ncomplete that the actual execution of the work was taken in hand,\r\nand one cannot be surprised to find that \"ledit secr\u00e9taire ordonn\u00e9,\"\r\nsays the King in his order for payment, \"pour mon service\r\n\r\n1 It is worthy of note that when the bureau was lent by Napoleon III. for this\r\npurpose, the keepers of the Garde-Meuble insisted that no casts should be taken, and\r\nthat even the figures holding the flambeaux should be copied, not cast.\r\n\r\n2 1886, pp. 123-128.

The extraordinary\r\ninterest of this bureau resides not only in the novelty of the form\r\nand the amazing perfection of the workmanship both of the\r\nsliding cover and of every mechanical detail, but in the fusion of\r\nthe \"Style Louis XV.\" with its later development--the development\r\nwhich in its final expression is called the \"Style Louis XVI.\"\r\nWe get here the moment of transition, or rather the dead stop, the\r\npoint at which that which has been ends, and that which is about\r\nto be is not yet clearly affirmed. \"You cannot,\" as M. S\u00e9n\u00e9 has\r\nsaid, \"recognize Cressent or Galet, but you feel as it were the\r\ncoming of Riesener, the proud successor and heir of Oeben.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, the King's bureau has suffered in its\r\ndetails both from the taste of his successor and the class hatreds of\r\nthe Revolution. Under Louis XVI., a helmeted head of Minerva\r\nwas substituted for that of Louis XV., the clock and the vases of\r\nthe balustrade have been rehandled, and the biscuit plaques now\r\nat the sides are supposed to have replaced the initials of the King.\r\nIf we are privileged to take in our hands the key which originally\r\nbore \"le chiffre du roy couronn\u00e9 de laurier et palmes, un m\u00e9daillon\r\ndans le milieu repr\u00e9sentant d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 le portrait du roy et les trois\r\nfleurs de l'ys de l'autre,\" we find that even these miniature details\r\nhave been sacrificed to a finely logical republican sentiment.\r\nFortunately such minor modifications do not interfere with the\r\nnoble impression conveyed by the broad and simple lines of the\r\nwhole construction, heightened to nobility by the splendidly\r\nsculptural aspect of the bronzes by which it is enriched.\r\n\r\n1 In the collections at Chantilly are two other fine works of the same date and style,\r\nthe authorship of which is unknown. These were, it is said, executed for the Count\r\nde Penthi\u00e8vre. The more important--which is accompanied by four cariatides--is, I\r\nthink, not absolutely intact; the second, which is in the Tribune, is decorated by\r\nsheathed busts of women; in the centre of the upper part is a lion-skin; on each side\r\nare figures of children, one bearing a torch, the other a dart. M. de Champeaux\r\nsays (pp. 158, 159) that other works, almost identical, are described in the inventory of\r\nthe furniture of Versailles made during the reign of Louis XVI., and he adds that\r\nJoubert--the \"\u00e9b\u00e9niste ordinaire du roy\" who, in 1759, executed the two corner-cupboards\r\nof the Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles,--is mentioned in the Tablettes de Renomm\u00e9e,\r\nas having carried out \"des meubles tr\u00e8s-pr\u00e9cieux pour Madame la Dauphine\r\net la Comtesse de Provence.\"",
  "300.png": "\r\nThe existence of a second bureau similar in character--which,\r\nas it bears the date \"1769,\" must have been begun long before\r\nthe \"bureau du roi\" was completed--bears witness to the admiration\r\nwhich that work inspired. This bureau is now at Hertford\r\nHouse and can be compared with the copy of the \"bureau du\r\nroi\" in the same gallery. We notice at once that the marquetry\r\ndiffers from that of the \"bureau du roi.\" It is of a more florid\r\ncharacter; on the top figure instruments of music, doves, a cock\r\nand open books, on the leaves of which are two not very legible\r\ninscriptions. To the left is that which has been read by M. de\r\nChampeaux as \"L'an mil sept cent soixante-neuf, le vingti\u00e8me\r\nf\u00e9vrier, furent pre perpetre \u00e0 Paris, ce....[** or ...?] Riesener fecit.\" To\r\nthe right, on leaves turned in the opposite direction, a letter, which\r\nbegins \"Monsieur,\" continues thus:--\"Die mir zum \u00f6fteren von\r\nIhnen erzeugten Liebes dienste,\" a phrase which, like the fragmentary\r\nsentences by which it is followed, may be deciphered with\r\nequal difficulty and disappointment. The only trace of interest in\r\nthe expressions of civility which conclude with the words, \"zu\r\nersuchen sie sich die M\u00fche geben haben,\" is the evidence they\r\nafford that the writer's German was as illiterate as his French.\r\n\r\nThe history of this bureau is involved in obscurity. Legend\r\nhas it that it was ordered for Stanislas Leczinski,[1] but the initials\r\n\"L. R.,\" plainly to be deciphered on the sides, cannot possibly\r\nstand for anything but \"Ludovicus Rex.\" Even if we admit that\r\nit was begun for King Stanislas and, after his death in 1766, was\r\nfinished by order of his daughter, Marie-Leczinska, as suggested\r\nby M. de Champeaux, we must remember that she only survived\r\nher father two years, so that the work must have been taken over\r\non account of the Crown before it was finally completed. On the\r\nother hand, we have to reckon with its mysterious omission from\r\nthe list drawn up in 1767--when the Veuve Oeben married\r\nRiesener--of all the goods finished and unfinished which were in\r\nthe \"Magasin\" that she had inherited from her husband. It is,\r\nhowever, certain that it once was in the \"mobilier de la Couronne\r\nde France;\"[2] that it was, as we shall see, sold in Holland with\r\nother furniture from the same source, and that it was discovered\r\nand bought by Sir Richard Wallace at Naples, whither it had\r\nbeen taken by Sir William Hamilton.\r\n\r\nBoth the mechanism and shape of the bureau, which is sometimes\r\ncalled \"bureau \u00e0 cylindre\" and sometimes \"bureau \u00e0 la\r\n\r\n1 See the arguments adduced in favour of this supposition by M. de Champeaux\r\n(\"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., pp. 218-220) and criticised by M.

The form is still that of the \"secr\u00e9taire,\"\r\nas the \"bureau \u00e0 cylindre\" was sometimes designated, but the\r\ncurves of the legs are less marked, and the general outline approaches\r\nthat of the one in the Petit Trianon carried out by\r\nRiesener in 1777.[3] In this last, we get the shape to which\r\nRiesener remained faithful. It is a work of pure \"Style Louis XVI.\"\r\nand may be taken as the most perfect type of the late form of the\r\n\"bureau \u00e0 cylindre.\" The lozenge-shaped inlay of the sliding\r\ncover is found again in one, of similar form, but executed in\r\nmother-o'-pearl, that used to be at Stafford House, but is now in\r\nthe collection of Mr. Alfred de Rothschild. The material in the\r\nlast instance is more eccentric than beautiful in effect, whereas the\r\ninlay of the bureau at the Petit Trianon has lent itself to the insertion\r\nof decorative motives of rare elegance.\r\n\r\nBefore he arrived at this definite affirmation of a change in\r\nstyle, Riesener had executed other work of a transitional character,\r\nsuch as the famous small, flat writing-table, also at the Petit\r\nTrianon. This work, executed in 1771,[4] still shows the influence\r\n\r\n1 The photograph kindly supplied by my friend, M. Pallain, is, unfortunately, too\r\ndark for the purposes of reproduction.\r\n\r\n2 M. de Champeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 222.\r\n\r\n3 Ibid., p. 228.\r\n\r\n4 Williamson, \"Les Meubles d'art du Mobilier national.\"",

H. Riesener,\" in the Garde-Meuble,[1] we\r\nsee the influence of Oeben disputed by the fashionable tendencies\r\nof the day. In this last, the bronze appliques themselves are of\r\na divided mind. Beneath the marble tablet the beading runs\r\nunobtrusively and the belt or ceinture below, with its reminiscence\r\nof sea-wave pattern volutes, is as strong and large as\r\na Japanese border, but the detached appliques on the panels show\r\nlittle baskets of flowers almost as finikin in their finish as the\r\nwreaths and garlands which were applied at a later date on\r\nwork such as the commode at the \"Minist\u00e8re de la Marine,\" or\r\nthat which bears the initials of Marie-Antoinette at Hertford\r\nHouse.[2]\r\n\r\nThe enormous industrial activity of Riesener has to be taken\r\ninto account as well as his incessant employment on the furniture\r\nof royal palaces.[3] The growth and change of his methods were\r\nremarkably illustrated by the great variety of specimens brought\r\ntogether in Paris at the \"Exposition des Arts d\u00e9coratifs\" in 1882.\r\nOne alone of the works by him then exhibited--a mahogany\r\nbureau with claw feet,[4]--recalled the practice of Oeben, but the\r\ntwo fine commodes from the Queen's bedchamber at Fontainebleau\r\nillustrated with magnificent effect Riesener's first and second\r\nmanner. They show in formidable contrast to a third--not, I think,\r\nexhibited in 1882--which I noted on a visit to the palace. In\r\nthis last the wood dominated, divided into rigidly-framed rectangular\r\npanels, the others, whilst belonging to different periods\r\nof Riesener's style, both showed the same tendency to rely for effect\r\nchiefly on the chased and gilt mounts. In the one the general\r\ncharacter is bold, the outline has a certain freedom, but this aspect\r\nis modified by the garlands of flowers and the ribbands by which\r\nthe uprights of the frame are ended. The second is a specimen of\r\nthe most flowery days of Riesener's work and we may class it with\r\n\r\n1 No. 316.\r\n\r\n2 A commode in the Jones collection (No. 1113) shows the contrast between the\r\ngarlands on the drawers and the bold mounts of the uprights. It is stamped \"J. H.\r\nRiesener\" and is a fine example of the use of diaper not only to enrich flat surfaces\r\nbut by its disposition on curved portions to indicate form.\r\n\r\n3 M. Champeaux says that between 1775 and 1785 Riesener received from\r\nthe Garde-Meuble sums amounting to about 500,000 livres and adds that during these\r\nyears the architect Gondouin (see \"French Architects,\" p. 43) figures in the same\r\naccounts as furnishing the designs for the furniture of the Royal Palaces. \"Le\r\nMeuble,\" t. ii., p. 224.\r\n\r\n4 No. 64.",

They are,\r\nhowever, open to the reproach that they resemble goldsmith's\r\nwork rather than sculpture. This is blame which may indeed be\r\ndistributed universally amongst the \"ciseleurs en bronze\" at the\r\nend of the century. As soon as the inlay of diaper and other\r\npatterns ceases to play an important part, the bronzes become the\r\nobject of first importance, and the finish bestowed upon them could\r\nnot be too minute to satisfy the eye.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics are nowhere more conspicuous than in\r\nthe oblong writing-table which, in 1882, together with a commode\r\nand secr\u00e9taire to match, was amongst the most noticeable of the\r\ntreasures which came to the hammer at the sale of the Hamilton\r\nPalace collections.[2] Both these works, which are amongst the last\r\nproduced by Riesener, had been executed, it is said, for the palace\r\nof Saint-Cloud, where the Court stayed with the Queen during\r\nthe summer of 1790. In the table, which was bought for Baron\r\nFerdinand de Rothschild, and which is now, I believe, the property\r\nof his sister, we get an admirable example, in its most exaggerated\r\nform, of what may be achieved by a brilliant artist in the way of\r\nhanging a piece of furniture with artificial flowers. The same treatment\r\nobtains in the second set, consisting of a secr\u00e9taire, a commode,\r\nand a jewel chest, which was bought at the same sale by Mr. Vanderbilt.\r\nWreaths of flowers in indescribable profusion, chiselled and\r\nundercut with inexhaustible patience, draped the lac panels of which\r\nthe body of these works was composed. The band below the marble\r\nslabs is covered with successive circlets of blossoms, in the centre\r\nof which figure the initials of the Queen.[3] This set also was made\r\nfor Saint-Cloud and sold for a trifle during the Revolution. It\r\n\r\n1 I have a note that an equally fine and elaborate work has been recently removed\r\nfrom the \"Minist\u00e8re de la Guerre\" to the Louvre, which is relatively poor in works\r\nillustrative of Riesener's final manner.\r\n\r\n2 No. 301.

M. de Champeaux\r\ncites a reproduction of the ordinary type of chiffonier, such as\r\nwas sold by Oeben, which he would have attributed to Oeben,\r\nhad it not borne the authentic stamp of Riesener. Only by an\r\nactive commerce of this nature could he have amassed the fortune\r\nwe know him to have acquired. Work for the Crown was not\r\nusually a way to wealth, and on one occasion, at least, we learn--from\r\nthe accounts of the Garde-Meuble, as cited by M. de Champeaux[2]--that\r\nRiesener was forced to accept a sum much inferior to his\r\ndemands. He had asked 4,640 livres for the little writing-table\r\nof the Petit Trianon,[3] but by the order of M. de Fontanieu received\r\nonly 4,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore to the support of the private customer that he\r\nhad to look in the exercise of ordinary prudence, and his reliance\r\non this source was amply justified. He was penniless when he\r\nmarried the widow Oeben. She died in 1776, and, six years later,\r\nRiesener took to wife Anne Grezel, the daughter of a \"bourgeois\r\nde Paris.\" From his marriage contract we find that he then\r\npossessed--reckoning certain sums due from the royal family and\r\nother humbler customers--a fortune of 504,571 livres, and these\r\nfigures do not include the value of the goods in his warehouses, the\r\nmodels of his bronzes, his personal effects and several \"rentes\r\nviag\u00e8res\" of some importance.[4]\r\n\r\nBy the irony of fate, Charles Delacroix, the husband of\r\nRiesener's step-daughter, Victoire Oeben, directed the sale at the\r\npalace of Versailles by order of the National Convention.[5] It\r\nlasted from the 25th August, 1793 till the 11th August, 1794,\r\nand Riesener himself must have seen many of his important works\r\n\r\n1 \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 232.\r\n\r\n2 Ibid., p. 228.\r\n\r\n3 Ibid., p. 225.\r\n\r\n4 Ibid., p. 212.\r\n\r\n5 The Assembl\u00e9e Nat. directed the \"Commission du Mus\u00e9e Central des Arts\" to\r\nopen a \"Mus\u00e9um fran\u00e7ais\" at the Louvre, of all the best things. This project had been\r\nstarted by d'Angiviller and he was on the point of realizing it when the Revolution\r\nbroke out. The Commission was very incapable (see Courajod, \"Le Journal\r\nd'Alex.

  "310.png": "\r\nThe final bitter experience had to be faced when, weary of\r\nwaiting for better times, or ground by poverty, Riesener attempted\r\nto realize the sums which he had invested at the famous auctions\r\nof Versailles. In vain he announced on the \"11 pluvi\u00f4se, an\r\nII.\" the sale of the costly furniture, \"de la fabrique de Riesener,\"\r\na great portion of which came from the private apartments of\r\nVersailles and Trianon, then on view at the Arsenal. In January,\r\n1795, the world of Paris was too unsettled to furnish a fitting\r\npublic for the occasion. Fortune deserted the once prosperous\r\nhouse; forced to quit the Arsenal, Riesener died in 1806, a ruined\r\nman. In the courage and conduct of the son, Henri-Fran\u00e7ois,[1]\r\nwho had been born to him in the first year of his union with\r\nMarguerite van der Cruse, he found some consolation for the\r\nvexations of his second and unfortunate marriage with Anne\r\nGrezel, vexations which seem to have pursued Riesener even after\r\nhe and she had seized on the first opportunity afforded by the new\r\nlaws to obtain their divorce.[2]\r\n\r\nTime has justified Riesener's confidence in his own work.\r\nCuriously representative of the flux and reflux of the conflicting\r\ntendencies of his age, it is therefore all the more interesting as a\r\nmatter of study. Yet, affected as he necessarily was by the caprices\r\nof his employers, his work nevertheless distinguishes itself from\r\nthat of his imitators and rivals by a certain boldness of line and\r\nbreadth of accent, which he retains even when he is condemned,\r\nas in the \"Petit Cabinet-Secr\u00e9taire\" of the Jones collection, to replace\r\nmarquetry--the tones of which he could ally in his work with\r\nsuch masterly sense of colour--by the cold and inharmonious plaques\r\nof S\u00e8vres porcelain. Everyone who approaches the subject is agreed\r\nin regretting that an artist of Riesener's value should have been\r\ncondemned by the false taste of his day to sacrifice his fine inlaid\r\nwork and the beautiful mouldings of his panels in order to decorate\r\nhis furniture with painted china. Although the possession of\r\ncabinets and tables of this class is the passion of a certain order of\r\nwealthy buyers, so impossible has it been found even by Riesener\r\nto bring them into harmony as to colour with the framework of\r\nwood which they accompany, that even his most successful\r\n\r\nis (No. 26) a magnificent \"secr\u00e9taire\" by Riesener. A note to this entry says that,\r\nas there were two others like it in the Garde-Meuble it was decided to keep only\r\none. See p. 170.\r\n\r\n1 He was a pupil of Vincent, but joined the national army after the outbreak of\r\nthe Revolution. The ruin of his family induced him to return to Paris, and turn his\r\nprevious studies to account as a portrait-painter.

  "313.png": "achievements in this line are seen to the greatest advantage in a\r\nblack-and-white reproduction.\r\n\r\nTaking his work as a whole, Riesener stands supreme amongst\r\nhis rivals, and he owes this pre-eminence to that perception of the\r\nvalue of emphasis in the right place which most of his contemporaries\r\nwere on the way to lose. The man who is usually\r\nnamed as one worthy to be compared with Riesener, J. F. Leleu,[1]\r\nhas never, I think, done more than give the impression of a sense\r\nof elegance and finish, coupled with a peculiar tendency to the\r\ncombination of broad, flat bands of gilt ornament with wreaths or\r\narabesques delicately chiselled and undercut. These characteristics\r\ndistinguish the cabinet resting on gilt claws and the commode in\r\nthe Wallace collection and the one recently acquired by Count I.\r\nde Camondo--as fine in its way as the Trianon commode with the\r\ncurved front. At the Petit Trianon, on either side of the fire-*place\r\nin the Salle \u00e0 manger, are two graceful cabinets with single\r\ndoors, the mounts of which--somewhat commonplace in detail--are\r\ncombined with Leleu's usual intention. I know nothing signed\r\nby him having as strong character as the bureau with the \"cartonnier\"\r\nbought by the late Duke d'Aumale at the Hamilton Palace\r\nsale.[2] The eight fluted legs of the table rest on lions' claws; the\r\nmassive frieze and festoons of ormoulu in high relief are repeated\r\non the \"cartonnier,\" and the force and power of the general aspect\r\nis such that although \"J. F. Leleu\" was actually stamped beneath\r\nthe frame, the work was entered in the final illustrated edition of\r\nthe catalogue as of the date of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThis powerful work is greatly beholden to the splendid character\r\nof mounts having all the characteristics of that \"Style Delafosse\"\r\nwhich we recognize in the Abercorn table of the Wallace\r\ncollection. It is an exception in the record of Leleu. As regards\r\nwork of which inlay forms a part Claude-Charles Saunier,[3] by\r\nwhom there is a very fine cabinet at Hertford House,[4] shows himself\r\nthe more original artist. The style of the marquetry (signed\r\n\"Foulet\") in this cabinet and the freedom of the noble sculptural\r\nmounts present a greater resemblance to Oeben than does the later\r\nwork of Riesener himself. The same may be said especially of\r\n\r\n1 R., 1764. Syndic, 1776. Died probably about 1782. The names of various\r\nfamilies by whom he was employed are known.

In this last work there are, moreover, certain\r\nfeatures of the construction plainly reminiscent of those which distinguish\r\nwork executed during the earlier half of the century. The\r\nprofile of the curved legs and the sculptural treatment of the mounts\r\nbear witness to the persistency of the \"Style Louis XV.,\" certain\r\ndetails in the side panels--a vase and drooping wreaths of flowers--are\r\nthe only touches which reveal the true date of its production.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of this bureau marks the treatment of the\r\ncover, which falls and presents to the hand a myriad little receptacles\r\nfor paint and powder and other \"make-up\" requisites.\r\nThis ingenious contrivance and the light colour of the inlay have\r\nbeen responsible for the legend which declares it to have been\r\nordered of David R\u00f6ntgen by his patroness, Queen Marie-Antoinette--a\r\nstory that has not the slightest foundation. At one\r\ntime, the name of \"David\" seems to have been applied indiscriminately\r\nto all cabinet-work inlaid with light woods, when the\r\ninterior contrivances presented a more or less ingenious character.\r\nThis is the only possible explanation of the attribution to R\u00f6ntgen\r\nnot only of the \"bureau-toilette\" but of the noble cabinet[1] at\r\nHertford House, undoubtedly by Saunier, though M. de Champeaux\r\nis mistaken in supposing that the name is on the sides. We\r\nare, indeed, fortunate in the possession of two fine examples of\r\nSaunier at his best. The style of his later productions suffers from\r\nthe meagre quality of forms to which his genius could not easily\r\nadapt itself. Riesener was a more flexible artist, and his work\r\ncontinued to find favour in the eyes of the Court even when\r\nbrought into competition with the most fashionable forms of\r\nelegance as illustrated by the craft of Martin Carlin.\r\n\r\nIn 1785, Martin Carlin received orders at the same time as\r\nRiesener, for the furniture of Saint-Cloud, but although his work\r\nmust be grouped with that specially representative of the period\r\nof Louis XVI., he must have produced a great deal in the previous\r\nreign. A commode with lacquer panels, which comes from\r\nBellevue, is now in the Louvre, and on the sides are seen the\r\nelegant detached balusters, which seem a special feature of Carlin's\r\nwork. These reappear in the work done for Saint-Cloud, a considerable\r\nportion of which is now in the Louvre. The same\r\nbalusters are repeated on a cabinet with S\u00e8vres panels at Windsor,\r\nwhich is decorated by a frieze of great beauty,[2] and this frieze\r\n\r\n1 See No. 1154, Catalogue, Bethnal Green.\r\n\r\n2 See our illustration.

This remarkably\r\nbeautiful detail is one which was possibly in common use,\r\nbut it is of a late character, and all Carlin's work is late in\r\ncharacter. We are struck by this fact whether we look at the\r\nmusic desk and its companion table, which are inlaid with S\u00e8vres\r\nand bear the united signatures of Carlin and Pafrat[2] at South\r\nKensington, or turn to the various other specimens of his work in\r\nthe same collection in which he has mounted panels of black\r\nJapanese lacquer.\r\n\r\nCarlin is not always happy in his choice of mounts, and his\r\npredilection for a tiresome drapery, fringed and tied up with little\r\ntassels, is an irritating feature of much of his work. He reached\r\nhis best in the furniture for Saint-Cloud and for the mounts of\r\nthat work it is almost certain that he, like Riesener, had the\r\nservices of that brilliant servant of the Crown, Thomire.[3]\r\n\r\nMuch of the work hitherto ascribed to Gouthi\u00e8re, certainly\r\nmuch of that at Hertford House, will have ultimately to be returned\r\nto Thomire.[4] Every day it becomes more doubtful that Gouthi\u00e8re\r\never executed mounts for cabinet makers; there is, at any rate, no\r\nevidence to establish his collaboration with Riesener. I should\r\nsuggest that we may begin by taking away from Gouthi\u00e8re all\r\nwork known to have been executed for the Court. He worked\r\nfor Madame Dubarry; he worked for great amateurs, like the\r\nDuchess de Mazarin or the Duke d'Aumont, but he did not work\r\nfor the King and Queen, who bought at the sale of the man who\r\nhad been his constant patron some of his finest creations, and\r\namongst these \"la belle coupe,\" now at Hertford House.\r\n\r\nThe Duke d'Aumont--at a date when the collections of the\r\nDuke de Choiseul-Praslin, the Duke de la Valli\u00e8re and the Duke\r\nde Tallard, were the boast of Paris--surpassed all his peers in the\r\nextraordinary beauty and cost of the works executed by his orders.\r\n\r\ngraceful balusters, and attributes the mounts to Gouthi\u00e8re. They are, I think, more\r\nprobably by Thomire.\r\n\r\n1 See illustration.\r\n\r\n2 The music-desk was at Trianon at the time of the Revolution and this fact\r\ndestroys the legend as to both having been given to Lady Auckland by the Queen.\r\nDe Champeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 246.\r\n\r\n3 1751-1843.

Over fifty pieces\r\nare thus marked and as we turn over the pages in which objects\r\nof the most various character succeed each other, accompanied by\r\nthe all important initial, we are at a loss whether most to admire\r\nthe passion for things beautiful, by which the Duke was distinguished,\r\nor the miraculous art which he was enabled to command\r\nin its service.\r\n\r\nThe strong personal interest taken by the Duke in his beautiful\r\nfurniture is shown in the pressing request which he made for permission\r\nto place two porphyry tables, with mounts by Gouthi\u00e8re,\r\nin the Salon of 1773, a request which Pierre, on behalf of the\r\nAcademy sternly refused.[4] The qualifications, unusual as they\r\nwere, of a craftsman such as Gouthi\u00e8re could be recognised only\r\nby the ma\u00eetrise.

A different judgment was evinced in 1865 when the\r\nMarquis of Hertford carried off the same \"belle coupe de\r\nGouthi\u00e8re,\" at the sale of the Prince de Beauvais for 31,900 fr.,\r\nbut even this price is hardly equal to that paid for it by the Queen\r\nin 1782, since money was then about four times its present value.\r\n\r\nYet the prices reached at the sale on the death of the Duke\r\nd'Aumont were by no means as high as those paid by the Duke\r\nfor his costly collections, and his heirs found that--looked on as an\r\ninvestment--his magnificent furniture was but a \"mauvaise affaire.\"\r\nSeveral things of great value, amongst which we find \"deux\r\ntables jaspe vert, deux vases c\u00e9ladon et un petit vase,\"[1] were still\r\nin Gouthi\u00e8re's hands, he having only received small advances on\r\nthe sums agreed in payment. After some negotiations, the heirs\r\ndecided to accept everything that should be delivered complete\r\nbefore a certain date, at an estimation--only arrived at after some\r\ndiscussion[2]--which, if not as high as Gouthi\u00e8re himself would\r\nhave had it, was far higher than the sums which were actually\r\nbrought in at the sale. In most cases, only the half, or even the\r\nthird of what the Duke had paid or agreed to pay was realized.\r\n\r\nThe cost of workmanship carried to this point of minute\r\nfinish must necessarily be exorbitant, nor is the delicate modelling\r\nand chasing of Gouthi\u00e8re's mounts their only beauty. The gilding\r\nis also of an extraordinary quality and of the beautiful tone of dead\r\ngold which he claims to have invented. The famous cabinet at\r\nWindsor, recently described as the \"Cabinet d'Artois,\"[3] was copied\r\nfor the Marquis of Hertford, about 1858. Years were spent\r\nin bringing the metal work of the reproduction to as delicate a\r\n\r\n1 Nos. 79, (?) 110 and 319.\r\n\r\n3 See Ch\u00e9ret's proc\u00e8s-verbal.

M. de Champeaux,\r\nwho sees in it a certain likeness to the famous jewel-cabinet of\r\nMarie Antoinette, suggests that the work is due to the designs of\r\nCauvet.[2] Although I do not recognize any of the freedom\r\nof Cauvet's hand, it is to me infinitely superior in elegance to the\r\nheavy and elaborate style of the jewel-cabinet made for the\r\nQueen of Louis XVI., and in place of Cauvet, I would suggest\r\nthe probable direction of Dugourc. As for the mounts, which\r\nare a marvel of matchless finish, they are far more likely to have\r\nbeen the work of Thomire than of Gouthi\u00e8re, and do, indeed,\r\npresent certain features of close resemblance to those of the jewel-cabinet,\r\nwhich are almost certainly from his hand.[3]\r\n\r\nOf work certainly by Gouthi\u00e8re, perhaps the finest collection\r\nis that now at Hertford House. There, too, the visitor may not only\r\nsee such indisputably authentic work as the \"belle coupe\" of the\r\nDuke d'Aumont, but he may contrast the work of Gouthi\u00e8re with\r\nthat of his great rivals and predecessors. He can pass from Jacques\r\nCaffieri and Charles Cressent to sculptural mounts of Duplessis, or\r\nstudy the \"Style Delafosse\" in the great table, where broadly\r\ndesigned flat ornament is garlanded with wreaths, massive in\r\ncharacter, yet not without a certain proud beauty. From these\r\nthings he can turn to the miniature excellence of the Dauphin's\r\ncandlesticks, with their admirable combination of flat diaper fleur-de-lis\r\nand full relief, or compare the elaborate series of girandoles,\r\nfestooned with ivy, through which show satyrs' heads accompanied\r\nwith panpipes and cymbals, with the stately reserve and perfection\r\nof the work of Martincourt.[4]\r\n\r\nAmongst the clocks there may be more than one from\r\nGouthi\u00e8re's hand.

Why,\r\none asks, should Oeben, Riesener and Beneman be held to have been\r\nabsorbed by their adopted surroundings, whilst David R\u00f6ntgen, Adam\r\nWeisweiler and Schwerdfeger must be reckoned as \"Germans\"?\r\n\r\nThe arguments by which one may justify the inclusion of\r\nOeben and Riesener in the purely French school do not apply, for\r\nexample, to Guillaume Beneman, who, as far as we can place\r\nhim, came into Paris some time after the middle of the century,\r\nwhen the Faubourg St. Antoine was flooded by workmen of\r\nGerman birth. The character of his monumental productions\r\ndoes not obviously impress the eye as Parisian, and I remember,\r\nyears ago, looking at a great commode by him in the Albertina,\r\ntaking it for granted that it was German work, and wondering\r\nthat a German should have been found at the date of its execution\r\ncapable of such brilliant chiselling and chasing. I did not even\r\nknow Beneman's name then, but I have never lost the impression\r\nthat his work has a character entirely un-French.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the position of a man like Beneman, as contrasted\r\nwith that of Oeben or Riesener, lies, I think, in the fact\r\nthat it took some time--we may, indeed, say many years---before\r\nthe loss of direction, consequent on the suppression of the \"Manufacture\r\ndes Meubles de la Couronne,\"[1] was fully realized.

A few\r\namateurs, as, for example, the Duke d'Aumont, demanded work such\r\nas might satisfy their personal taste; the architects still retained\r\nsome control over that which was specially produced for buildings\r\nunder their charge, but the German workmen who came into\r\nParis, and who were naturally in favour with the Queen, had a\r\ngreat deal to say to the heavier lines and coarser forms which prevail\r\nin much of the furniture produced during the later years of\r\nher reign. Few of them have given us anything at once so elegant\r\nand so noble as the mahogany cabinet signed \"C. Richter,\"[3] which\r\nis now at South Kensington. Even that, fine as it is in general\r\ncharacter, is injured by the commonplace type of portions of the\r\nmounts. The fringed drapery and tassels along the cornice may,\r\nhowever, be forgotten in the pleasure given by the beauty of the\r\nwood which is employed with admirable skill.

Born at Herrenhag in 1743,\r\nhe went with his family to Neuwied to the Moravian settlement,\r\nwhen he was barely ten years old and was wholly his father's pupil.\r\nHe took over the business in 1772 and associated with himself the\r\nclockmaker Kinzing,[3] and, two years later, made his first appearance\r\nin Paris. We find in Wille's journal, under the date\r\n30th August, 1774, \"M.

In 1776, it is said, he appeared at St.\r\nPetersburg with a great quantity of his most important productions.\r\nThe Empress was ready, we are told, to admire and wonder, but\r\ncould not be persuaded to buy, her funds just then being exhausted\r\nby the war with the Turks. In the night preceding the visit\r\nwhich she had promised to pay to R\u00f6ntgen's exhibition, arrived\r\nthe news of a naval victory won by the Russians at Tschesm\u00e9, and\r\nwhen she was received on the following day at the place appointed,\r\nmatters were so arranged that her eyes should fall at once on an\r\nimposing \"secr\u00e9taire,\" which was surmounted by a clock bearing\r\na Genius, whose graver indicated the date of the successful naval\r\nengagement, which R\u00f6ntgen had contrived to add that morning.\r\nCatharine could do no less, in acknowledgment of the courtly\r\ncompliment, than buy the whole collection.\r\n\r\nM.

Goethe,\r\nin \"Wilhelm Meister,\" when telling his enchanting story of the\r\nlittle fairy lady travelling with her mortal lover, compares the box\r\nwhich she inhabits to one of R\u00f6ntgen's desks, in which \"at a pull\r\na multitude of springs and latches are set in motion,\" and a famous\r\nreading-desk of this class, in which every apparent feature was\r\ntransformed at a touch into others, which revealed a variety of dissimilar\r\npurposes, was presented by Catherine the Second to the\r\nMuseum of the Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThis form of ingenuity is usually most conspicuous in cabinets\r\nof a simple exterior, such as that attributed to R\u00f6ntgen in the\r\ncollection of Mr. Massey-Mainwaring, not to be distinguished\r\notherwise from any other bit of good joinery of the same date\r\ncoming from the Rhine provinces. In the execution of his\r\nmarquetry work, R\u00f6ntgen seems to have employed an assistant of\r\ngreat skill named Chr\u00e9tien Krause. His name is given in connection\r\nwith the execution of the great \"secr\u00e9taire\" bought by Louis XVI.\r\nfor 80,000 lt., and placed in his own apartments. It was eleven feet\r\nhigh, and was built on the usual plan of a deep chest of drawers,\r\nby which the upper portion was supported. In front, the decorations\r\nof seven marquetry panels symbolized the seven liberal arts.\r\nSculpture in the centre was in the act of engraving the Queen's\r\nname on a column, to which Minerva was about to attach Her\r\nMajesty's portrait. The three orders were introduced in its construction\r\nwith mouldings and capitals of gilt bronze, and the inhabitants\r\nof Parnassus took refuge on the top of a musical clock\r\n\r\n1 The address at first was \"chez M.

They certainly do not\r\nreflect the taste of his wealthy customers at the date of their\r\nexecution, for he seems to have made them and decorated them\r\nwith mean and common little beadings when his compatriot\r\nRiesener was in his most flowery and elaborate phase. Of a table,\r\nwhich R\u00f6ntgen exhibited in 1779, we are told that the top represented\r\na group of shepherds, in a new kind of marquetry, the\r\nshades and shadows of which were carried out in little pieces of\r\nwood. This sort of marquetry, says the journalist to whom we\r\nowe the description,[2] closely resembles mosaic of marble; it is\r\nexecuted in the same manner so that the shades are neither burnt\r\nin nor engraved, nor smoked, as has been necessary for their\r\nexpression up to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy feature of the marquetry employed by\r\nR\u00f6ntgen is to be found in his occasional treatment of figure subjects\r\nwith great breadth and simplicity. If, as is said, he was indebted\r\nfor the design of these to his friend, Zick, the painter of Coblenz,\r\nby whom he was introduced to Wille, then Zick deserves his share\r\nof the compliments due to R\u00f6ntgen on the success achieved in the\r\ninlay of his \"\u00c6neas saving Anchises,\"[3] which figures on the top of\r\ntwo oval work-tables in the Museum at South Kensington, and on\r\nthe even more remarkable panels which have found a place at\r\neither side on the top of a large flat writing-table, decorated with\r\nS\u00e8vres, in the same Museum.\r\n\r\nOne of these panels on the writing-table is signed \"R.\" It\r\nrepresents a philosopher in his dressing gown, attended by his\r\nservant who is unpacking books, which will form a considerable\r\naddition to his master's library. Above their heads, on the open\r\nleaves of a folio, is inscribed \"Nihil simplici in genere omnibus ex\r\npartibus perfectum natura expolivit.

Molinier as representing \"La G\u00e9ographie\r\net le Commerce maritime.\" If, however, one fails to find these\r\ntitles appropriate one cannot but subscribe to all that may be said\r\nof the freedom and ease of the work, characteristics which are also\r\nmarked in the rendering of the scene from the \u00c6neid, which\r\noccurs oddly enough on two tables from different collections, which\r\nare almost identical in shape.[2] One of these in the Jones bequest\r\npermits us to compare the general effect attained by R\u00f6ntgen with\r\nthe somewhat spotty character of similar work in two tables\r\nstanding near, which are signed by \"G. Jansen.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAs to the third table, which has been attributed to R\u00f6ntgen in\r\nthe same collection, I find some difficulty. It is almost identical\r\nin shape with the other two, but the marquetry is of a wholly\r\ndifferent character. On a dark surface, the inlay is of wood,\r\nchosen evidently for its resemblance in hue to ivory: in this wood\r\ngarlands of flowers, tied with ribbands, are executed \"en cama\u00efeu,\"\r\nand shaded by colouring of a bluish-green tint. Inlay of the same\r\ncharacter appears on two corner cupboards and on a fine upright\r\ncabinet, also bequeathed by Mr. Jones. All these works present\r\nfeatures so similar, that it is probable that they came from the\r\nsame atelier. The mounts--as in the case of the pair of corner\r\ncupboards in Mr. Massey-Mainwaring's collection, one of which is\r\nstamped \"P. Roussel,\"[4] whilst the other bears the name of\r\nJ. H. Riesener--have no distinctive character. They are of the\r\ntype common to the work of Oeben and others of his contemporaries,\r\nand seem to have gone the round of all the workshops.\r\n\r\n1 See Molinier, \"Le Mobilier au XVII et au XVIII Si\u00e8cle,\" p. 213.\r\n\r\n2 One is in the Jones bequest; the other has, for the present, been placed in the\r\nSalon S\u00e9rilly.\r\n\r\n3 The work of Jansen is much earlier than that of R\u00f6ntgen, who, as far as I\r\nknow, uses no ivory in his inlay. Another foreigner, \"Georges Schlichtig,\" has signed\r\na commode of early Louis Seize style, in the collection of Count Isaac de Camondo,\r\nwhich is noticeable for the fanciful delicacy shown in its use.\r\n\r\n4 Bethnal Green, Nos. 3180 and 3129. The panels of these cupboards are of a\r\nstrongly German character, showing odd buildings, odder trees, diminutive figures,\r\nboats, sea, etc. Roussel, like Riesener, was employed by the Garde-Meuble (de\r\nChampeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" pp. 162, 264), and the marquetry may have been given to\r\nthem to mount, but sometimes we get more than one name on a single work, as when\r\nwe read on a table in the Jones collection those of Jansen, Cosson and Deloose.",

It is, however, possible that he has less\r\nhonour than his due at the present day because he so seldom signed\r\nhis work. To find his initials plainly stamped, as they are, on the\r\ncentre drawer of a bureau, belonging to M. Mialhet, is an extraordinary\r\noccurrence.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was free, it is said, as a foreigner from the action of that\r\nrule of the corporation at Paris, which enjoined that all work\r\nshould be stamped on its completion.[2] Such regulations could not\r\nbe enforced on \"goods made in Germany\" and David R\u00f6ntgen\r\nmade his at Neuwied. In this way we must account not only for\r\nthe extreme rarity of his signature but for the touch of the German\r\npeasant, which seems to lie on all his work.\r\n\r\nNative character is a far more conspicuous element in the work\r\nof R\u00f6ntgen than in that of Haupt, the great maker of French furniture\r\nat Stockholm, who has signed a noble commode in the Jones\r\nbequest, adding, \"Kongl. hof. Schatullmak: Stockh: 1779.\"[3]\r\nHaupt, I may say in passing, figures as \"Naupt\" both in the\r\nworks of M. de Champeaux and of M. Molinier, but there is no\r\ndoubt about his name and his furniture, chiefly to be found in\r\nSwedish royal palaces, gives him serious claims to reputation.\r\nThe greater part of it was, I should imagine, designed by Rehn.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the German craftsman--who transferred himself\r\nto Paris in the later years of the century--of the doctrines of the\r\npseudo-classic reaction, was far less happy than the effect of those\r\ninfluences by which it had been preceded. We have seen two\r\nGermans--governed by the best traditions of the French school--endowing\r\nthe century with the matchless \"bureau du roi;\" the\r\npowers of Weisweiler, Beneman, Schwerdfeger and their fellows--all\r\ninclined from birth towards that logical dryness which has\r\nfrequently afflicted the German artist--developed under less\r\n\r\n1 See de Champeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 276. The bureau is, he says,\r\ndecorated with \"un superbe sujet en marqueterie repr\u00e9sentant une sc\u00e8ne chinoise.\"\r\n\r\n2 This rule might lead us to expect to find everything stamped, but few pieces of\r\nfurniture have had the good fortune to come down to us intact. When repaired by\r\nthe cabinet maker the plane has too often destroyed the certificate of origin given by\r\nthe initials of the maker.\r\n\r\n3 See illustration.

His furniture\r\nhas often a toylike aspect and it is scarcely possible to watch\r\nwithout a smile the efforts of the average, well-developed Briton\r\nto make aquaintance[**typo 'acquaintance'?] with the diminutive cabinets by which he is\r\nadmirably represented at Hertford House. These are seen to\r\ntheir advantage in the photograph from which our illustration is\r\nreproduced, for the S\u00e8vres plaques that form the panels are\r\ncommon in colour, and completely out of harmony with their\r\nsetting. In the little writing-table, at the Louvre,[1] which has a\r\nwaste-paper basket on the cross-bar beneath, Weisweiler has the\r\nhappier luck of mounting pieces of fine old Japanese lacquer. The\r\nband beneath is of polished steel, ornamented in the centre with a\r\nstock pattern, which shows two winged sphinx supporting a mask,\r\ntheir tails elegantly foliated to correspond with the wreaths which\r\nfigure right and left. The central motive reappears on the fine\r\ncommode with black lacquer panels, in Mr. Massey-Mainwaring's\r\ncollection, which bears the stamp \"Adam Weisweiler,\" but the\r\nmost characteristic feature of all these works is to be found in the\r\nemployment of extremely elegant figures of cariatides to carry out\r\nthe spindle legs on which both cabinets and table are supported, as\r\nwell as to accompany the sides of the commode--detached in this\r\nlast instance after the fashion in which Martin Carlin detaches the\r\nslight pilasters which are as persistent a feature of his work.\r\n\r\nThe national predilections, which in Weisweiler developed in\r\nthe direction of an elegance too dry and frigid to be gracious, led\r\nGuillaume or Wilhelm Beneman[2] to select forms the ponderous\r\ncharacter of which is enhanced by the elaborate delicacy of their\r\ndecoration.

In the execution of these, he worked\r\nwith the modellers and sculptors, Martin and Boizot, whilst his\r\nmounts were cast by Forestier, chased by Thomire, Bardin or\r\nTournay, and gilt by Feuch\u00e8re or Galle.

All the suggestions of architectural\r\nform in arch and spandril are obtained in the application of ornament,\r\nwhich has really nothing to do in the way of accentuating\r\nor indicating construction.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the assemblage of costly material handled with\r\nlavish skill, the intended effect of magnificence just lacks that air\r\nof easy profusion without which magnificence tends to mere ostentation\r\nor even vulgarity. Yet, somehow, Beneman does stop short\r\nof vulgarity and does achieve magnificence, but he is always a\r\nlittle dull and more than a little heavy. The commode at Fontainbleau[**typo Fontainebleau],\r\nwhich he carried out with the help of Joseph Stockel[3]\r\nand decorated with a military trophy, reminds one of a triumphal\r\narch, so impersonal is it in character.[4] Several of a similar style\r\n\r\n1 \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., pp. 254, 256.\r\n\r\n2 The Exhibition of \"L'Art r\u00e9trospectif,\" held in that year, did enormous service\r\nto the history of French art by permitting the comparison of the works of various\r\nmasters. The works of Beneman had previously been laid to the account of Riesener,\r\nbut the stamp of Beneman on furniture then shown established his claims and we\r\nhave now no monstrous evolution to account for in tracing the development of\r\nRiesener's talent.\r\n\r\n3 R. 1775.\r\n\r\n4 Reproduced by M. de Champeaux, p. 253.

No such trivial details\r\ncan, however, modify in any serious degree the monumental aspect\r\nproper to Beneman's work, which most certainly recalls rather the\r\nimposing features of Gondouin's architecture than the hand of\r\nDugourc, to whose design their composition has, I believe\r\nerroneously, been attributed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's patronage of her countrymen probably caused the\r\norder for one of her great jewel-cabinets to be given to Jean-Ferdinand\r\nSchwerdfeger.[1] One ordered for her of Gouthi\u00e8re--probably\r\nby the Duke d'Aumont--at the time of her marriage, was decorated\r\nby gilt reliefs on steel modelled by Boizot. It is said to have been\r\na marvel of workmanship, but disappeared during the Revolution.\r\nProbably it was too small for the treasures it was intended to hold,\r\nfor amongst Bellanger's papers at the Cabinet des Estampes, I found\r\na \"Projet de meuble destin\u00e9 \u00e0 serrer les Bijoux de Mme. la Dauphine\r\nex\u00e9cut\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s les dessins de M. Belanger, architecte, dessinateur\r\ndes Menus Plaisirs du Roy. Approuv\u00e9 pour estre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\r\nLe duc d'Aumont.\" This design, in which very likely Dugourc\r\nco-operated, is of the most decided Empire type, but up to the\r\npresent time I have not come across it or any trace of its existence.\r\n\r\nEven if the Cabinet designed by Bellanger was executed prior\r\nto 1774, it had probably become far too small to contain the jewels\r\nbelonging to the Queen in 1787, when, as we learn from the\r\nMemoirs of Mme. Campan,[2] the one--which (after a stay in the\r\nPetit Palais[3]) has now been removed to Versailles--was completed\r\nunder the orders of Bonnefoy-Duplan, the \"garde-meuble-concierge\"\r\nof the Queen at Trianon. The work of Schwerdfeger\r\nwas--like that of Beneman--the work of the cabinet-maker, and\r\nhe has shown himself in this example an equal master of his craft.\r\nAs for the bronzes, they are probably not, as has been supposed,\r\nby Gouthi\u00e8re,[4] but by those who were regularly employed by\r\nthe Garde-Meuble:--Forestier, Thomire or Feuch\u00e8re.[5] The\r\ndetails may be seen fairly well in our illustration, but I must call\r\nattention to the delicate paintings under glass framed in mother-o'pearl\r\nwhich were executed by the miniature-painter, Degault,\r\n\r\n1 R. 1786.\r\n\r\n2 T. i., p. 304.\r\n\r\n3 It was for a long while at the Tuileries. After having figured in the Mus\u00e9e des\r\nSouverains, it appears to have been at St. Cloud during the Restoration; then it was\r\ntransferred to the Trianon, whence it was brought to Paris for the Exhibition of\r\n1900.\r\n\r\n4 Davillier, \"Cabinet du duc d'Aumont,\" p. xxii.\r\n\r\n5 De Champeaux, \"Le Meuble,\" t. ii., p. 282.",

Degault is, in fact, usually\r\ndescribed as \"peintre de cam\u00e9es,\" and this class of work was often--as\r\nshown in the panels of a small sideboard in the collection of\r\nCount I. de Camondo--employed on designs in themselves of\r\nexceeding grace and beauty.[1] The possibilities which it presented\r\nof excessive elegance and minuteness of detail recommended its\r\nuse to men who sought a compensation for the heaviness of their\r\nconstructions in covering them with the utmost elaboration of\r\nminiature ornament,[2] but miniature ornament cannot lighten heavy\r\nwork if the proportions are not in themselves good.\r\n\r\nNow, if the jewel-cabinet of Marie-Antoinette be compared\r\nwith the Windsor cabinet, it will be seen at once that its proportions\r\nare not only less elegant, but are infinitely poorer in character.\r\nThe weight of the oblong coffer itself is rendered all the more\r\ntrying to the eye by its horizontal position and by the pyramidal\r\nshape of the group of figures resting, in the centre, on the dead\r\nlevel of the upper line. In the Windsor cabinet far narrower\r\nproportions are carried skilfully upwards by crowning ornament,\r\nin which anything like a pyramidal effect is most skilfully avoided\r\nboth in the centre group itself and in the flower-filled vases by\r\nwhich it is accompanied on either side. If we examine the base\r\nof either of these cabinets, we find that both rest on the same\r\neight eccentric quiversful of arrows, which were then popular as\r\nsupports for tables, beds, and every sort of furniture; they are,\r\nhowever, employed with a difference. In the Windsor cabinet\r\nthey are brought into two groups of four, each united by cross-*bars\r\non which stand vases out of the mouths of which are issuing\r\nflames; in the jewel-cabinet of the Queen there are no such\r\nalleviations, but the eight straight quivers stand in uncompromising\r\nand ungracious freedom. It is impossible to look at them in their\r\nnaked simplicity, and not remember that we are on the verge of\r\nthose changes which will bring us to the square ungainly stumps\r\nwith which Jacob Desmalter supported the jewel-cabinet of Marie-Louise.[3]\r\n\r\n1 The rage for novelty and the love of very brilliant, if delicate colour, led to the\r\nexecution of similar decoration under glass, in the feathers of humming-birds and\r\nother birds of bright plumage. M. Molinier cites (p. 210) the m\u00e9dailler of the\r\nch\u00e2teau de Versailles, now in the collection of M. Alphonse de Rothschild, as thus\r\ndecorated.

Delisle, \"un carosse[** carrosse]\r\nmagnifique de pi\u00e8ces de la Chine.\" In the following year (1724)\r\nthe advertisement of Martin l'ain\u00e9[** l'a\u00een\u00e9] appeared in the \"Mercure.\" He\r\nand his brother lost no time in pushing forward their claims, and\r\nin 1730 an arr\u00eat du conseil--renewed in 1744--gave to Simon-Etienne\r\nle cadet, the right of making \"toutes sortes d'ouvrages en\r\nrelief de la Chine et du Japon\" for twenty years, to the exclusion\r\nof all other workers, with the exception of his brother Guillaume\r\nl'ain\u00e9[** l'a\u00een\u00e9]. The two younger brothers, Julien and Robert, seem to\r\nhave lived and worked in a subordinate position to that occupied\r\nby their elders. Guillaume's name alone is mentioned in 1738 as\r\nemployed on the \"berline\" for the cort\u00e8ge of the Prince de\r\nLichtenstein, whilst Simon-Etienne prepared a \"cal\u00e8che\" for the\r\nsame purpose.[1]\r\n\r\nTheir success in the execution of these commissions appears to\r\nhave brought them the final consecration of their ingenious art\r\nwhen, in 1748, all their various establishments were declared\r\n\"Manufacture Nationale.\" Six years earlier (1742), we get the\r\nfirst mention of the famous green varnish in the list of presents\r\nsent by Louis XV. to the Grand Seigneur: \"Un grand jeu d'orgue,\r\navec son buffet verni en vert par le sieur Martin.\" For pure\r\ncolour, the small \"chaise \u00e1[** \u00e0] porteurs\" of the children of the\r\nMontmorency family in the Mus\u00e9e Cluny may be cited in the\r\nfirst rank. The little bouquets of flowers by which it is covered\r\nare not remarkable, the little Love, who supports the coat of arms\r\non the door, is ill drawn, but the work charms by the exceeding\r\nbeauty of the green ground. The beauty of this famous ground,\r\npowdered with gold, is again seen to perfection on the magnificent\r\ncoach, in the Mus\u00e9e Cluny, described as \"ayant servi aux ambassadeurs\r\nde France \u00e0 Vienne sous Louis XV.\" Three of the panels\r\nare painted with groups in the style of Le Moine,[2] and in the\r\n\r\n1 Mantz, \"Exposition r\u00e9trospective,\" G.B.A., 1866.

A similar ground\r\nappears on the four panels in front of a sideboard at South Kensington,[1]\r\nwhich, brought to London from Paris badly damaged, in\r\n1850-60, was not only rebacked and remade, but unfortunately\r\ndecorated by a painter named Christian with inappropriate ornament\r\non the upper portions of the legs.\r\n\r\nThe death of Martin l'ain\u00e9[** l'a\u00een\u00e9] took place, we are told, in 1749,\r\nthe year in which some of his family began to work at Versailles\r\nin the apartments of the Dauphin and the Dauphine, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe\r\nde Saxe.[2] The disappearance of all these decorations, as\r\nwell as of those executed at Bellevue and at other great houses in\r\nFrance;[3] the foreign character of those at Sans-Souci which were\r\ncarried out by Jean-Alexandre Martin with the help of one of the\r\nOppenhaupts,[4] led me to attach the greater importance to a hint\r\ngiven by M. de Champeaux concerning the recent existence in\r\nParis of a Salon decorated by one of the Martin: \"Le dernier,\"\r\nhe says, \"que nous ayons vu avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans l'h\u00f4tel Pontalba,\r\napr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4tel d'Havr\u00e9.\"[5] This decoration,\r\nwhich went by the name of \"Salon de la Chine,\" had been first\r\ninstalled by the Duchess du Maine in the h\u00f4tel built by de Cotte\r\nfor the dowager-duchess de Conti, which stood not far from those\r\nbuilt by Boffrand in the Quartier St. Germain for the marquis\r\nde Torcy and the marquis de Seignelay.[6] A little inquiry showed\r\nthat from the H\u00f4tel Pontalba, the \"Salon de la Chine\" had\r\npassed into the possession of M. Edmond de Rothschild, and it\r\nwas with some sense of disappointment that having followed it\r\nso far, I found it to be impossible to go further on account of the\r\nworks still in progress in his h\u00f4tel.\r\n\r\nDisappointment, however, awaited me had I been able to visit\r\nthe famous Salon, for it is not a \"d\u00e9coration peinte par les\r\nMartin.\" My friend, M. Gustave Dreyfus, writes, \"Le Salon\r\nChinois de l'h\u00f4tel Pontalba est en laque de Chine et non en\r\n\r\nwhich was bought at Milan, he says: \"Il est \u00e0 craindre que son exposition dans une\r\nsalle humide n'occasionne des d\u00e9gradations qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 sensibles et qui iront sans cesse\r\nen s'aggravant.\"\r\n\r\n1 Bought at the sale of the Hamilton Palace collections.

It is seen in perfection on fans, such as the very pretty one\r\nrepresenting Alexander and Porus, after Le Brun, exhibited by\r\nM. Boucheron in 1888, or on small boxes, like the round box once\r\nin the Spitzer collection, the gold ground of which was decorated\r\nwith figures of Diana and an attendant nymph. Such work was\r\nconsidered worthy of the most costly mounts, and we read of a\r\n\"bo\u00eete en or ... en vernis martin toute cisel\u00e9e et ouvrag\u00e9e en or\r\npar le fameux Pierre Germain,\" which was in the collection of\r\nM. Leopold Double. In these lovely toys we can look into the\r\nfine work upon the gold--the waves and stripes and powderings\r\nwhich gleam through the transparent varnish finally applied.\r\nThe ground of a little needlecase in my possession--wholly of gold\r\nleaf--is festooned with ribbed lines and stripes, on which are\r\nsprinkled crown-imperial lilies and other flowers, and little butterflies\r\npainted in colour, but work so fine as this is absolutely ineffective\r\nexcept when employed on this small scale.\r\n\r\nThe passion for the green tint was actually so keen that any\r\ndecoration of its surface was felt to be unnecessary. It was sufficient\r\nthat colour and varnish should receive--as in the famous\r\ntable by I. Dubois at Hertford House--the support of richly\r\nchased mounts. The style of these mounts has a splendid vigour,\r\nthat of the trophies on the base of the \"serre-papier\" which\r\naccompanies the table is less good, and the gilt group--containing,\r\namongst others, figures of Cupid and Psyche, Peace and War--presents\r\na somewhat gingerbread aspect. This character is marked\r\nin the boat-shaped inkstand with mermaids at the prow and stern,\r\nand the whole group of works has that slightly vulgar air which\r\ndenotes the intention of \"l'exportation.\" In this case, \"l'exportation\r\npour la Russie\" was in view, for these costly toys were a\r\npresent from Louis XV. to Catharine of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this rather brazen magnificence stands that class\r\nof subjects usually attributed to the youngest brother of Martin\r\nl'ain\u00e9[** l'a\u00een\u00e9], Robert Martin.[1] He it is who, not content to imitate the\r\n\r\n1 1706-1765.

The fanciful figures on the panels of his chairs and his\r\nchariots: the courtly shepherds and shepherdesses, the Loves and\r\nGraces, have often a wonderful delicacy of charm. Their bright\r\nhues, and the brighter hues of the flowers by which they are\r\naccompanied, receive an all subduing glow from the skilled use of\r\ngold, whether it covers wholly or but partially the ground on\r\nwhich they lie. After the death of Robert Martin the art which\r\nhe so brilliantly illustrated appears to have dropped to the level of\r\na common industry.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to here repeat the criticisms by which\r\nI have continuously tried to classify the various groups of work\r\ndealt with in this volume. Again and again I have attempted to\r\nmake it evident that their relative excellence must be determined\r\nby the measure in which they possess the pre-eminent quality of\r\n\"style.\" At the present time the chronicles of the auction room\r\nshow that the arts of the eighteenth century inspire the keenest\r\ncompetition amongst those who look on the possession of costly\r\nfurniture as one of the most expressive signs of wealth. It is,\r\nhowever, impossible not to observe how small an element of just\r\nappreciation mingles with the passion which devotes to their\r\npurchase the vast fortunes of our day. In this and in other\r\nrespects the millionaires who now seek after these things present\r\na strong contrast to those for whom they were originally designed.\r\n\r\nThe French financier, that great figure of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was one whose tastes had been moulded not only by the\r\npressure of tradition but by the surroundings in which he had\r\nbeen born. By a list of the names of the \"Fermiers-g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\"\r\nwe can follow up all the improvements of Paris. For them were\r\nraised those marvellous h\u00f4tels which amaze us even now as we\r\ncome across them in some narrow and dirty street. They were\r\nfit to co-operate, as they did co-operate, in the fulfilment of what\r\nhas been described as the \"mission\" of the French aristocracy of\r\nthat day, by directing the arts of the nation. Not content simply\r\nto run up prices at sales under the guidance of dealers, these men\r\nunderstood that it lay in their hands to develop \"les \u00e9l\u00e9mens du\r\ntravail contemporain, d'alimenter l'art du pr\u00e9sent et de pr\u00e9parer\r\nl'art de l'avenir.\" In this exercise of their taste and their intelligence\r\nis to be found the apology for their reckless prodigality,\r\nbut the combination of circumstances by which individual luxury\r\nrendered service to the State does not seem likely, at least in our\r\ndays, to be repeated.",
