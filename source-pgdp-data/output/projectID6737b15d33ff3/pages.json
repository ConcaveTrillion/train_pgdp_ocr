  "f007.png": "\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe main part of each of these Essays has been printed\r\nat various times during the last ten years. Some of them\r\nare now accessible only with difficulty. Since they are\r\nscattered through various publications and since they\r\nrepresent, in fact, the continuous development of a single\r\nline of thought, it has seemed advisable to collect them\r\ntogether. All the Essays except the first are considerably\r\nmodified from the form in which they originally appeared.\r\n\r\nThe conception that the universe is a rational system,\r\nworking by discoverable laws, seems to have first appeared\r\nas a definite belief among the Ionian Greeks in the sixth\r\ncentury B.C. If we had records sufficient to trace the\r\ninception and early development of this idea, there would\r\nsurely be few topics more fascinating or more worthy of\r\nstudy. Alas! the material is wanting and the history of\r\nIonian philosophy is little but guess-work. Nevertheless, the\r\nprocess by which a rational conception of the world comes\r\ngradually to possess the mind is one which touches us all\r\nnearly, whatever may be our philosophy. Anything that\r\nmay throw light upon it is worthy of consideration. The\r\nonly adequate historical record that we have of the rationalization\r\nof thought, affecting an entire civilization, is to be\r\nfound in the documents which display the passage of the\r\nmedieval into the modern way of thinking. The history\r\nof that process, when it can be written in proper perspective,\r\nshould provide an absorbing theme.\r\n\r\nFor the development of this theme we are far better\r\nplaced than for the study of the Ionian rationalization.\r\nThe material is very abundant and the medieval scholar\r\nhas seldom to regret the scarcity of his documents. Nevertheless,\r\nbut little progress has been made towards the\r\nproper digestion of the available material from the",
  "f008.png": "point of view that we are discussing. The medievalist\r\nis seldom a man of science, not infrequently he has his\r\nown axe to grind, and it is only in recent times that adequately\r\ntrained medieval scholars have given their attention\r\nto the development of rational conceptions of the\r\nmaterial world.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, looking back on the Middle Ages, that\r\nthey represent a process of slow decline from the intellectual\r\nefficiency of classical antiquity, and that this decline is\r\nfollowed by a recovery. The brilliance of the recovery in\r\nsome departments and in some periods, e.g. of Art and\r\nPhilosophy in the thirteenth century, must not blind us\r\nto its extreme slowness in the observational sciences. It is\r\nthe twofold process of decline and recovery in the observational\r\nsciences that the author has set himself to trace.\r\nThese Essays deal, however, only with the earliest and first\r\nsteps in the recovery. They do not claim to trace the\r\nlater steps and the author has here little to say of developments\r\nafter the twelfth century. More detailed\r\ntreatment of the later medieval period must be reserved\r\nfor another volume, though some of these Essays block\r\nout the general line of treatment of the later period.\r\nHere some sort of attempt is made to trace the collapse\r\nof ancient science into the swamp of magic and the first\r\nattempts at recovery from that hideous slough.\r\n\r\nThe first Essay appeared in its present form as the\r\narticle on Science in the volume on The Legacy of Rome\r\nedited for the Clarendon Press by Mr. Cyril Bailey in\r\n1923. This Essay traces the decay of the rational spirit\r\nin the Roman world. It is hardly our purpose here to\r\ndiscuss all the causes of that decay. One important cause\r\nis certainly the failure of the active process of scientific\r\nresearch. The mind, ceasing to be ventilated by new\r\nknowledge, turned inward on itself and we can perceive\r\nearly but very definite symptoms of more complete decay.\r\n\r\nThe second Essay on The Dark Ages and the Dawn of\r\nScience was originally contributed to a volume of essays",
  "f009.png": "entitled Science and Civilisation edited by Mr. F. S. Marvin\r\nand published by the Oxford University Press in 1923.\r\nThe article as there printed has been considerably modified.\r\nIt is an attempt to trace, in barest outline, the entire course\r\nof medieval science, and as such is the key to the volume.\r\nThe author recognizes, however, that it is impossible in\r\nthe short space of such an article to give more than the\r\nmost general sketch of so large a subject, and that on many\r\npoints the present state of our knowledge is really inadequate\r\nfor definitive statement.\r\n\r\nMuch of the material of the third Essay, The Lorica of\r\nGildas the Briton, was contributed to the Transactions of\r\nthe Royal Society of Medicine (Historical Section) in 1920.\r\nThis Essay has been considerably altered from its original\r\nform. In it we touch bottom in our series. The text\r\nwhich is here treated represents the most extreme magical\r\ndegradation of the classical and ecclesiastical traditions.\r\nIn the other Essays no attempt is made to set forth a full\r\ntext, the attention of the reader being directed rather to\r\ngeneral movements and tendencies. Here, however, it\r\nseemed to the author that he was dealing with a type\r\nof material of which few of his readers could have had\r\nany experience. Such magical and superstitious practices\r\nas crop up from time to time in our every-day life we are\r\naccustomed to treat with a smile. They seem to us harmless\r\nfoibles, and few realize the degradation involved when\r\nthe mind becomes saturated with such material and deluded\r\nwith such hopes. The miserable theurgy of the Lorica of\r\nGildas the Briton exhibits to us Science, Theology, and\r\nLiterature in the last stages of decomposition. Though\r\nCeltic in origin, the most ardent Celticist will hardly\r\nclaim that it adds radiance to the Celtic glamour.\r\n\r\nThe Essay on Early English Magic was originally read\r\nbefore the British Academy and was published in the\r\nProceedings of that body in 1920. It has been rearranged\r\nand somewhat abbreviated from its original form. The\r\nmaterial that is discussed is, in many places, little above",
  "f010.png": "the Lorica, which was in fact freely used by the Anglo-Saxons\r\nas a protective charm. The main interest of\r\nAnglo-Saxon magic appears to the author to be the evidence\r\nthat it provides for the mingling of cultures even at a very\r\nearly date, and in a simple state of society. It happens\r\nthat the diverse sources of Anglo-Saxon magic are relatively\r\neasily traced. These sources are set forth, but special\r\nemphasis is laid on the Teutonic element. This is stressed\r\nnot because the Teutonic element is very large--for it is\r\nnot--but because it forms a useful contrast to the classical\r\nand ecclesiastical elements that are more extensively\r\ndiscussed elsewhere in this book.\r\n\r\nThere is a reflexion to which a perusal of these two\r\nEssays, one on a Celtic and the other on an Anglo-Saxon\r\ntheme, may perhaps incline the reader. A type of medieval\r\nenthusiast exists who would have us believe that the world\r\nwould be well lost if we could only return to the intellectual\r\nhabits of our forefathers. Books and articles are\r\nwritten on early Irish learning, on the Carlovingian revival,\r\non the British and early English Churches and on like\r\ntopics, in a tone which would lead undiscerning readers\r\nto believe that the Learning, the Civilization, the Culture,\r\nor the Humanity of those days are comparable to our own.\r\nProgress to these writers is but illusion, and that which has\r\nbeen shall again be. To those disposed to think on these\r\ndespairing lines we may recommend a perusal of the material\r\nwith which we have here to deal. It may be objected\r\nthat we have chosen the lowest and rejected the highest\r\nmanifestations of the medieval spirit, and that these are\r\nbut the products of local ignorance and perversion. But\r\nthe manuscripts from which we have taken this material\r\nare, in fact, for the most part of exquisite monastic\r\nworkmanship. They were valuable and valued possessions,\r\nwritten by highly skilled scribes among a people\r\nwith whom even literacy was rare. If we were really\r\nto exhibit the lowest manifestations of the medieval spirit\r\nwe should have to go beyond the written page with",
  "f011.png": "which these Essays deal, and should be exhibiting customs\r\ncomparable to those of West African savages. But all ages\r\nand all civilizations have their savage as well as their saintly\r\nside. To gain a true view of what Europe was thinking and\r\nfeeling during the Middle Ages, the reader would be well\r\nadvised to refuse to fix his gaze either on St. Francis, St.\r\nThomas, and Dante on the one hand or on the bestial\r\npractices of the medieval peasantry or on the cruelty and\r\nwrong wrought by the Inquisition on the other hand.\r\nIn placing the Lorica of Gildas, the history of the herbal\r\nand the Anglo-Saxon magical material by the side of St.\r\nHildegard and the School of Salerno, it seems to the author\r\nthat he has presented a favourable and not an unfavourable\r\npicture of the medieval mind.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of the Middle Ages it is always necessary to\r\nremember that the knowledge of the day was not only\r\nperverted and corrupted in quality but that it was also\r\nextremely small in extent. Indeed, we suspect that this\r\nlatter element has given one of the main interests to\r\nmedieval literary studies. Our civilization is nowadays\r\nso complex and all parts of our world are so interdependent\r\nthat it would be extremely difficult to trace\r\nthe sources of any modern writer and to provide any\r\nexact demonstration of the degree to which he is original.\r\nWith the medieval writer the case is different. Even the\r\nmost learned of medieval writers--even Albertus Magnus\r\nhimself--knew so piteously little compared to a modern\r\nscholar that it is possible, with sufficient application, to\r\ntrace all the sources of his information. Albertus was\r\namong the best, not the worst, of medieval men of science,\r\nand yet, in what is perhaps his most important scientific\r\ncontribution, the De Animalibus, it has been possible to\r\ntrace almost every sentence to its source. It is precisely\r\nthis fact which makes medieval literature such an interesting\r\nmedium for demonstrating cultural movements.\r\n\r\nThe fifth Essay in the volume, that on Early Herbals,\r\nappeared in its original form as an article in the Edinburgh",
  "f012.png": "Review in 1923. The author there expressed those general\r\nviews which he developed in detail--producing the evidence\r\nfor his conclusions--in an elaborately illustrated article\r\nin the Journal of Hellenic Studies in July 1927. The Essay\r\nin this volume contains a number of these illustrations,\r\ntogether with some others. The history of the herbal\r\nis continuous from Greek to modern times. An immense\r\nnumber of manuscripts survives, and the author has examined\r\nscores of them. The herbals provide a peculiarly\r\nfavourable medium for tracing the passage of tradition\r\nfrom people to people. Their texts are simple, their\r\nmotives are obvious, such ideas as they contain are of an\r\neasily comprehensible order, and the tradition of the figures\r\nwith which they are adorned can be traced even more\r\nreadily than the tradition of the texts themselves. The\r\nentry and recession of the magical element can be\r\nclosely watched in these herbals. We have been able to do\r\nno more than touch the fringe of a very large subject, but\r\nwe would recommend the study of the herbal to the young\r\nfolklorist as a little trodden and very attractive field.\r\n\r\nThe sixth Essay, on The Visions of St. Hildegard, appeared\r\noriginally in 1917 in Vol. 1 of the author's Studies in the\r\nHistory and Method of Science. It went out of print very\r\nrapidly and has not since been republished. This particular\r\narticle aroused a good deal of criticism, but the theory of\r\nthe pathological basis of these visions has, we believe, been\r\ngenerally accepted by those who have read it with any\r\nknowledge of the condition known as 'Migraine.' The\r\narticle has been rearranged and largely rewritten. Most\r\nof the criticism directed against the article had to do with\r\nthe author's rejection of the genuineness of certain works\r\nascribed to Hildegard. The matter turns on points that\r\nare not likely to engage the reader of this volume, and\r\ntheir discussion is here omitted. The chief interest of\r\nHildegard's visions are (a) the cosmic theory on which they\r\nare based, (b) the extremely involved presentation of that\r\ntheory, (c) the remarkably close way in which the minia-*",
  "f013.png": "*tures of two manuscripts visualize the text and suggest a\r\nliving tradition arising with the prophetess herself, and (d)\r\nthe pathological basis of the visions. On all these points\r\nthe author's conclusions seem to him to have stood the test\r\nof time and he therefore reproduces them in much their\r\noriginal form.\r\n\r\nIn the scheme of this book Hildegard is of importance as\r\nrepresenting an early attempt at something like a coherent\r\nphilosophy, intended to cover the appearances of the\r\nmaterial universe. As such her work is, in fact, Science,\r\nand with her we have left the Dark Ages and the Dawn\r\nhas begun. In placing this view before the reader we\r\nwould ask him not to be deterred by what is, for us, the\r\nextremely bizarre manner of presentment of her views.\r\nShe is feeling her way to a rational explanation of her\r\nworld, and the fact that her solution is not our solution and\r\nthat she is grotesquely wrong on matters of fact, should\r\nnot blind us to her intellectual merits. The same criticisms\r\ncould, after all, be made of Aristotle or of any other early\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nThere is another point in the history of science of which\r\nHildegard provides an interesting illustration. As is\r\npointed out in more than one place in this volume, the\r\nimportant event in the history of science in the Middle\r\nAges is the arrival of the Arabian learning. It was the\r\nArabian influence that finally set the intellect of Western\r\nEurope on the high road to the Renaissance. This volume\r\ndeals with the earlier medieval period, the pre-Arabian\r\nage, the 'Dark Age' as we may call it, and Hildegard marks\r\nthe parting of the ways. She has had no access to an\r\nArabian writer, even in Latin translation, but she does live\r\nin a world in which indirect Arabian influences are beginning\r\nto make themselves felt. Some of these influences\r\nwe have been able to trace.\r\n\r\nThe volume closes with an Essay on The School of\r\nSalerno and its Legends. This article was contributed by\r\nMrs. Singer, in collaboration with the author, as an 'His-*",
  "f014.png": "*torical Revision' to the issue of History in October 1925.\r\nAt Salerno was the first institution in Europe that had\r\nthe semblance of a University. It was but a semblance.\r\nNevertheless, the small amount of first-hand observation\r\nthat was going on at Salerno as early as the eleventh century\r\nmarks the first upward trend of the human mind from\r\nthe degradation of the Dark Ages. Moreover, the school\r\nof Salerno exhibits the new Arabian influence at an earlier\r\ndate than any other centre of learning. These are facts\r\nwhich can hardly be gainsaid. But the glamour of Salernitan\r\nhistory has proved a centre around which legends\r\nhave clustered. Some of these, which are still widely\r\nspread, have utterly corrupted many accounts of the\r\nhistory of the school. In any event that history is extremely\r\ndim, but it becomes at least a little less dim by the\r\ndispersal of the cloud of legend. The somewhat humorous\r\nelement which seems to cling to Salerno, and to lend the\r\nstories of it a peculiar aroma, make it a not unsuitable\r\ntheme on which to end.\r\n\r\nThe author has to thank first of all Mrs. Singer, whose\r\nname appeared as a collaborator in the last Essay, but who\r\nhas, in fact, been his collaborator in them all. For\r\npermission to reproduce these essays he expresses his thanks\r\nto Mr. Cyril Bailey, Mr. F. S. Marvin, the Clarendon\r\nPress, the Council of the British Academy, the Council\r\nof the Royal Society of Medicine, the editors of the Edinburgh\r\nReview, of the Journal of Hellenic Studies and of\r\nHistory, and to Messrs.

The Roman Attitude to Nature\r\n\r\nThe scientific idea, the conception of a reasonable universe,\r\ncame to the peoples of Central Italy at a much later date\r\nthan that at which it began to influence the Greeks of the\r\nEastern Mediterranean and of Southern Italy. With the\r\nRomans pure science always remained somewhat of an\r\nexotic; it was applied science that attracted them. The\r\ndetermining factor in the development of science within\r\nthe Empire was the absorption of the Kingdom of the\r\nPtolemies, whose capital, Alexandria, was and long remained\r\nthe scientific head-quarters of the world. Yet despite\r\nthe stimulus that followed on the contact with Alexandrian\r\nthought, Rome produced no great creative scientist. It\r\nis in the distribution and dissemination of the Greek\r\nwisdom rather than its development that we see the r\u00f4le\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nYet though Rome cannot be said to rival Greece in pure\r\nscience, it must be allowed that in an allied department her\r\nachievements are remarkable. Among the Greeks art, in\r\nits highest development, excelled in idealistic representation--as\r\ndid science in abstract reasoning. Man, the main",
  "p002.png": "theme of the Greek painter and sculptor, became godlike;\r\nthe lower creation is less often represented, and when it\r\nis, the beauty of the animal is reflected from the nobility\r\nof its master [Fig. 4]. As for plants, they are practically\r\nomitted from Greek art save in connexion with ornament.\r\n\r\nNow this contrasts profoundly with the development of\r\nart at Rome. The character of Augustan art was determined\r\nby the character of the Augustan country gentleman.\r\nThe great Roman landowner, like his representative nearer\r\nhome, was no great hand at philosophizing; least of all\r\nwas he given to what would have seemed to him that useless\r\nspinning of arguments about the essential nature of things\r\nwhich provided a leading motive in Greek scientific literature.\r\nBut if no philosopher, he was a lover of the countryside,\r\nan observer by temper in that field which the Greek\r\nhad taken to investigating because he believed it to lie on\r\nthe road to knowledge. He had it in him to become a\r\nshrewd and close-observing naturalist, one who paid attention\r\nto the habits of plants and animals perhaps more than\r\nto the minute details of their form, but seldom given to\r\ngeneral ideas about them.\r\n\r\nThis Roman spirit, slow to acquire any appreciation of\r\nthe scientific attitude, yielded little in the way of scientific\r\nresults. Yet the art which Rome produced in the Augustan\r\nage is instinct with the study of bird and beast and flower\r\nand tree. Nature is treated as she had never been before.\r\nThe affection of Virgil for his bees, his cattle, and his herbs\r\nrecalls the power and faithfulness with which creatures\r\nand plants are represented in Augustan art. Thus panels\r\nof the tomb of the Haterii in the Lateran Museum [Figs. 2\r\nand 3] render to perfection the habit of a young wind-blown\r\nwild-rose. The buds are particularly natural, but the opened\r\nflowers strangely show four petals instead of five. At the\r\ntop of one of the pillars three bees may be seen drinking\r\nfrom the hollow in the capital, while a fourth has been seized\r\nin the claw of a bird. Two other birds--perhaps 'Bee-*",
  "p003.png": "*eaters,' Merops apiaster--pursue bees among the branches\r\nbelow. The scene might have been prepared to illustrate\r\npassages in Virgil's fourth Georgic.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of the faithful imitation of\r\nnature in Augustan art. It would not be easy to find any\r\nparallel in Greek art of the best period to the treatment\r\nof plants in some of the metal work of Pompeii [Fig. 1].\r\nEven the brutality of a Cato finds reflection in the procession\r\nof fatted sacrificial beasts on the altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus\r\n[Fig. 6]. Compare the ewe and her young of the\r\nwell-head at Vienna [Fig. 5]\r\nwith the noble head of the\r\nParthenon steed [Fig. 4], and\r\nyou have the contrast epigrammatically\r\nset forth. The feeling\r\nof the Augustan artist is that of\r\none studying nature as something\r\nquite outside man; it is\r\nthe sheep herself who tends her\r\nyoung; her love is not a sentiment\r\nreflected from mankind.\r\nThe Augustan artist has produced a nature study. The\r\nGreek has wrought a creature that sets forth the glory of\r\nthe god.\r\n\r\nWhen Hellenism first began to influence Roman thought,\r\nabout the time of the second Punic war (c. 214 B.C.), Latin\r\nliterature had as yet no scientific element. During the\r\nperiod between 200 and 189 B.C. Rome broke the power\r\nof Alexander's successors and established her protectorate\r\nthroughout the Eastern Mediterranean. The influence\r\nof Greek ideas now grew rapidly. With the triumph after\r\nthe battle of Pydna (168 B.C.) numerous Greek hostages,\r\neducated and of good family, came to Rome, and the library\r\nof the Macedonian king which was brought with them\r\nmade a nucleus for the infiltration of Roman society by\r\nGreek wisdom.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Silver bowl ornamented\r\nwith vine-shoots. From Pompeii,\r\nafter Overbeck.",
  "p004.png": "\r\nFor long there were those who struggled against this\r\ndevelopment without being able to stem it. Among them\r\nwas Marcus Porcius Cato (234-149 B.C.). He prepared\r\na sort of encyclopaedia for the use of his son, in which he\r\nendeavoured to show that the old Roman literature could\r\nhold its own against this newfangled material from Greece.\r\nOf that treatise only fragments have survived, but in his\r\nbook De re rustica we possess the oldest Latin prose work\r\nthat has come down to us. Its contents are very miscellaneous,\r\nrelating principally to rural economy, but dealing\r\nalso with cookery recipes, magical formulae, medical\r\nprescriptions, and much other strange material which shows\r\nhow little scientific was the traditional Roman attitude.\r\n\r\nAlthough the relation to science improved as time went\r\non and all educated men learned Greek and were affected\r\nby Hellenic philosophy, it is probable that the general\r\nscientific principles of the Greeks as expressed in the writings\r\nof the Hippocratic, Aristotelian, and Alexandrian schools\r\nwere seldom understood even by educated Romans. The\r\nprevalent attitude towards nature among the Latin-speaking\r\nupper classes, whether Italian or provincial, was expressed\r\nby the Stoic creed. That system, based on a rigid conception\r\nof the interrelation of the different parts of the world,\r\nprovided little stimulus for the acquisition of new knowledge\r\nor for anything in the way of research. Thus, in place\r\nof knowledge accumulating progressively on a basis of a\r\nwide and far-reaching theory, we get either a type of exact\r\nbut intellectually motiveless observation or a rejection of\r\nall knowledge not of practical importance.\r\n\r\nThere have been various attempts to explain why the\r\nRomans did not continue the scientific work of the Greeks.\r\nIt is a strange phenomenon, for the value of the experimental\r\nmethod was still being demonstrated by the achievements\r\nof the Alexandrians. That school continued its\r\nactivities under Roman rule and was the ultimate source of\r\nthe only important Latin medical work that has come down\r\nto us, the De re medica of Celsus. It has been said that the",

  "p005.png": "Roman mind could find no time from conquest and administration\r\nto attend to scientific matters, but this will not explain\r\nthe whole matter, for there were those among the\r\nRomans who were able to answer the no less exacting claims\r\nof philosophy, of literature and, above all, of rhetoric.\r\nMuch too has been made of the view that regards the\r\nscientific pause as due to the lack of instruments of precision.\r\nThis, however, hardly explains the facts, for scientific instruments\r\nare at least as much the result as the cause of the\r\napplication of scientific method. The matter seems\r\nrather to have lain deep in the Roman character. It was\r\nwrapped up in the nature of the favourite Roman philosophy,\r\nStoicism. It needs to be considered in general relation to\r\nthe Roman psychology and is not improbably related to\r\nthe Roman obsession for Rhetoric.\r\n\r\nIn general we may say that Roman science appears at\r\nits best in the department of 'Nature Study' and at its\r\nweakest in 'Pure Mathematics.' The success or failure\r\nof the Romans in any scientific field may be roughly gauged\r\nby its nearness to one or other of these disciplines. The\r\ngauge must be biased, however, by the Roman desire for\r\n'useful studies.' There was for instance, as we shall\r\nsee, a special development in certain departments of\r\nGeography (p. 40).\r\n\r\n\u00a7 2. Latin Works on General Science\r\n\r\nWe have several works by Latins which deal with the\r\nimplications of science in general. These, however, seldom\r\ninvolve any expert knowledge of natural phenomena, and\r\nare concerned rather with the philosophical relations of the\r\nscience of their day than with science itself, as we understand\r\nthat word to-day. Of such works the most striking\r\nand widely read is the De rerum natura of Lucretius\r\n(c. 95-55 B.C.). The man is aflame with his theme and\r\nexhibits a veritable missionary zeal. Yet, however magnificent\r\nas literature may be the work of Lucretius, and how-*",
  "p006.png": "*ever important as our best representative of Epicurean\r\nviews, it is too close an imitation of Greek philosophy to\r\nbe of the highest value for our immediate purpose. It\r\nneither records first-hand observations nor does it represent\r\nan attitude of mind that can be considered as typically\r\nRoman. Lucretius, nevertheless, is interesting for us as\r\nthe only Latin writer who gives us a complete and coherent\r\nscheme of natural knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the scientific reader of Lucretius will\r\nnaturally be drawn to his atomic view of matter. The\r\natomic conception was very ancient and had been taught\r\nby Leucippus (fl. c. 450 B.C.), Democritus (fl. c. 410 B.C.),\r\nand Epicurus (342-270 B.C.) among the Greeks. Lucretius,\r\nfollowing these writers, explains the origin of the world\r\nas due to the interaction of atoms, and this interaction, he\r\nbelieves, is without the intervention of any creative intelligence.\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the position of the\r\ngods in the Lucretian scheme, but we may note that even\r\nmental phenomena are for him of atomic origin and there\r\nis no real existence save atoms and 'the void' (inane).\r\n'Nullam rem e nilo gigni divinitus unquam.' Nothing is\r\never begotten of nothing by divine will. Everything springs\r\nfrom 'semina certa,' determinate units. The genesis of all\r\nthings is typified by the generation of organic beings and\r\nthe species of plants and animals give us models for all processes\r\nand natural laws. This conception of generation\r\nhas its converse. 'Haud igitur possunt ad nilum quaeque\r\nreverti.' Things cannot then ever be turned to naught. Such\r\nan attitude involves that 'indestructibility of matter' which,\r\ndespite modern changes in our conceptions, is the historical\r\nfoundation on which our chemical and physical knowledge\r\nhas been built.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the Lucretian theory to modern\r\natomic views is, however, more apparent than real; not\r\nonly are the atoms of Lucretius of different shapes and sizes\r\nbut also he knows nothing of the definite laws by which they\r\nare held together as molecules, he has no inkling of the real",
  "p007.png": "nature of chemical combination, and he is without that\r\n'doctrine of energy' that is so characteristic a feature in\r\nall modern physical theory. Moreover, his work had little\r\ndirect influence on the development of the modern doctrine.\r\nEpicurean thought has not, in fact, historically been very\r\nfavourable to scientific development. The atomic view of\r\nmatter was practically lost during the Middle Ages, and\r\nAristotelian philosophy, which involved the doctrine of\r\nthe continuity of matter, was paramount for centuries.\r\nAtomic views, it is true, were known to a few 'Arabian'\r\nphilosophers, e.g. Averroes (1126-98) and Maimonides\r\n(1135-1204), but their general standpoint was abhorrent\r\nto the scholastics. Lucretius was rediscovered by the\r\nscholar Poggio in 1418 and deeply affected the philosophy\r\nof the Renaissance. The influence of that philosophy\r\nwaned with the great physical synthesis of the seventeenth\r\ncentury with which the name of Galileo (1564-1642) is\r\nassociated. Atomic views continued to be held by a few\r\nisolated thinkers, but modern scientific atomism arose\r\nalmost independent of the ancient sources. John Dalton\r\n(1766-1844), the father of modern atomism, was probably\r\nnot directly influenced by Lucretius.\r\n\r\nYet there is one scientific department in which the\r\ninfluence of Lucretius on Renaissance philosophy may be\r\nsaid to have borne more direct fruit. Lucretius concludes\r\nhis work with a description of the plague at Athens in 430\r\nB.C., and in describing this visitation he follows very closely\r\nthe account of Thucydides, and the Lucretian version is\r\nof interest as having contributed something to modern\r\nviews of the nature of infection. In discussing the nature of\r\nthe plague Lucretius demands 'What is its cause?' and\r\nhe answers--working out his atomic theory here also--that\r\n'just as there are seeds (semina) of things helpful to our life,\r\nso, for sure, others fly about that cause disease and death.'\r\n\r\nNow in the sixteenth century Lucretius, whose work had\r\nbeen printed as early as 1473, was studied by an eminent\r\nVeronese physician, Girolamo Fracastoro (1483-1553).",
  "p008.png": "That acute investigator had absorbed much from the ancient\r\natomic philosophy. Pondering on the nature of epidemics--of\r\nwhich he was a close and accurate student--Fracastoro\r\ndeveloped a theory that such diseases were due to seminaria,\r\n'seed-stores,' the separate semina or 'seeds' of which\r\nreproduced their like in infected victims to whose bodies\r\nthey were carried by fomites or 'foci of infection.' These\r\n'seeds of disease' of Fracastoro bore some analogy to the\r\nLucretian atoms.\r\n\r\nFracastoro followed Lucretius in denying any essential\r\ndistinction between the living and the non-living. For him\r\nvital phenomena were explained as a product of atomic\r\nactivity. Such views became widely diffused in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, though they were seldom fully understood.\r\nAs a result of misunderstanding 'atom' became a synonym\r\nfor 'living mite' or 'animalcule' and is thus encountered\r\nin the writings of Shakespeare, for instance (see As You\r\nLike It, III. v. 13, and contrast with III. ii. 246). Much of\r\nFracastoro's theory can be read into Lucretius, but the\r\nRenaissance physician developed it with newly acquired\r\nknowledge and with a skill peculiarly his own. The theory\r\nof infection remained much where Fracastoro left it until\r\nquite modern times, when it assumed a new meaning at\r\nthe magic touch of Louis Pasteur (1822-95).\r\n\r\nSome have seen in Lucretius the beginnings of a theory\r\nof evolution. He certainly exhibits a scala naturae, a\r\n'ladder of life' somewhat similar to that which may be\r\ndiscerned in the writings of Aristotle. The earth produces\r\nout of herself first plants and then animals of ever higher\r\nand higher type. 'Even as down and hair and bristles\r\nare first formed on the limbs of beasts ... so the newborn\r\nearth raised up herbage and shrubs first, and thereafter\r\nproduced the races of mortal things.' This idea of 'spontaneous\r\ngeneration' was almost inevitable until the realm\r\nof minute invisible life had been explored by means of the\r\nmicroscope which was not invented until 1608. It is thus\r\nno wonder that Lucretius follows Aristotle and all antiquity",

Moreover, he invoked for the\r\nprocess a mechanism for the clearer explanation of which\r\nthe world had to await the arrival of Darwin. Yet notwithstanding\r\nour familiarity with the idea of 'survival of\r\nthe fittest,' the Lucretian view of the manner in which the\r\nmore perfect creatures reached their present state must\r\nsound very strange to modern ears:--\r\n\r\n'Many monsters earth then essayed to create, born with\r\nstrange faces and strange limbs; the man-woman, between\r\nthe two, yet not either, sundered from both sexes; things\r\nbereft of feet; things without hands; things dumb;\r\nthings blind; things locked together by the clinging of\r\nthe limbs so that they could not move nor avoid calamity\r\nnor take what they needed. Monsters and prodigies she\r\nwould thus create, yet vainly, since nature forbade their\r\nincrease, nor could they reach the bloom of age nor find\r\nfood.... Many races of living creatures then perished\r\nnor could beget nor propagate, for whatever animals now\r\nfeed on the breath of life, either craft or courage or speed\r\nhas preserved their kind from the beginning of their being.'\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the phenomena which Lucretius has\r\nchosen for special description we cannot fail to be struck\r\nwith the fact that he has been drawn to those which present\r\nsomething of the magnificent, dramatic, or cataclysmic.\r\nThere is nothing of the quiet and minute observer about\r\nhim. Thunder and lightning, water-spout, volcano and\r\nthunderbolt, suffocating vapours and great pestilences--these\r\nare the themes he selects for description. Almost\r\nthe sole exception is his account of the magnet. This has\r\na special interest because the passage drew the attention of\r\nWilliam Gilbert (1540-1603), physician to Queen Elizabeth.\r\nGilbert's De magnete, the first important work on experimental\r\nscience to be printed in England, appeared in 1600.",
  "p010.png": "He quotes Lucretius on the magnet and exhibits Lucretian\r\ninfluence (see pp. 109-10).\r\n\r\nThe remarkable composition of Lucretius takes an\r\nisolated place in Latin scientific literature. More characteristic\r\nare the Rerum rusticarum libri III of Varro and\r\ntwo works of the first Christian century, the Naturalis\r\nhistoria of Gaius Plinius Secundus (A.D. 23-79), the most\r\ncomplete and extensive work of its kind that has come down\r\nto us from antiquity, and the Quaestiones naturales of Lucius\r\nAnnaeus Seneca (3 B.C.-A.D. 65).\r\n\r\nMarcus Terentius Varro (116-27 B.C.) was born at Reate\r\nin the Sabine country, where the old Roman qualities are\r\nsupposed to have lingered longest. He was educated by\r\nL. Aelius Stilo, the first systematic Latin philologist and\r\nantiquary. Later he went to Athens and came under\r\nPlatonic influence; he exhibits, however, throughout his\r\nworks some Stoic leanings. Varro wrote encyclopaedically\r\non the sciences and his works were the prototype of the\r\nnumerous mediaeval works on the 'liberal arts.' He\r\ndistinguished nine of these studies, namely, grammar,\r\ndialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music,\r\nmedicine, and architecture. Of these the last two were not\r\nrecognized by Cassiodorus (A.D. 490-585), Martianus\r\nCapella (c. A.D. 500), and Isidore (A.D. 560-636), who handed\r\ndown the tradition to the Middle Ages, and the number\r\nof liberal arts was thus reduced to seven (see pp. 68-9).\r\n\r\nVarro, like Cato, tried to collect Latin learning and set\r\nit over against the Greek. Of the works of Varro unfortunately\r\nonly two have been preserved, the Res rusticae and\r\na part of the De lingua latina. If Varro depends on Cato,\r\nhe develops a surer judgement based on more experience\r\nand knowledge. As a friend of Julius Caesar, whose literary\r\nand scientific tastes he shared, we should expect from him\r\nthis higher and more tolerant standard. He was employed\r\nby Caesar in arranging the great stores of Greek and Latin\r\nliterature for the vast library which he intended to found.",
  "p011.png": "\r\nThe Res rusticae was written by Varro in his eightieth\r\nyear. In the first book he devotes himself to the general\r\ntheme of agriculture, in the second he discusses cattle and\r\nfarm animals, and in the third bees, fish, and a number\r\nof wild creatures. The old scholar records, to some extent,\r\nhis own experience, but he has collected his material mainly\r\nfrom the writings of others. He thus already exhibits the\r\nderivative tendency which is so marked among later Latin\r\nwriters on scientific topics. His interests are wider than\r\nmight perhaps be expected, nor does he confine his discussion\r\nto his own country but makes comparisons with other\r\ndistricts and lands. The presentation is enlivened by\r\nhumour and the scene does not lack animation, though the\r\nmechanism of the dialogue often works stiffly. He uses\r\nevery opportunity to bring in etymology, and he rejoices\r\nin artificial separations and divisions, so that in general the\r\nwork gives one very much the impression conveyed by many\r\ntreatises of mediaeval origin. Yet his style is always lucid\r\nand is sometimes vigorous and racy.\r\n\r\nAmong the more pleasing of the pictures that Varro draws\r\nis that of the life of bees. This, however, is far inferior\r\nin accuracy to that set forth by Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) in\r\nthe Historia animalium, and contains nothing that is not\r\nto be found in the poetic account of Varro's younger contemporary,\r\nVirgil (70-19 B.C.). Among the more remarkable\r\npassages in the work is one in which sanguine observers\r\nhave perceived an anticipation of the modern discovery of\r\nthe nature of malaria. 'In building houses,' he says,\r\n'you must avoid the neighbourhood of marshy places ...\r\nbecause when the marshes begin to dry they engender a\r\nmultitude of invisible insects which are introduced into the\r\nmouth and nostrils with the inhaled air and occasion serious\r\nillnesses.'\r\n\r\nVarro, along with the other Latin agricultural writers,\r\nearly drew the attention of the scholars of the Renaissance.\r\nHis work was transcribed by some unknown Veronese\r\nhumanist as early as 1329. Cato, Columella, and Palladius",
  "p012.png": "were soon added to form a collection Scriptores rei rusticae.\r\nAfter the invention of printing this collection was widely\r\ncirculated. The first edition appeared at Venice in 1472,\r\nand many subsequent issues, bearing the names of distinguished\r\nscholars, poured from the presses during the\r\nhundred years which followed.\r\n\r\nIn the next writer we have to consider, the elder Pliny,\r\nthe Greek leaven has worked further than in Varro. Pliny\r\nwas born at Como in A.D. 23 and was educated by P. Pomponius\r\nSecundus, a poet and military man who inspired him\r\nwith a love of learning. He studied botany in Rome in\r\nthe garden of Antonius Castor. Coming under the influence\r\nof Seneca he studied philosophy and rhetoric, and practised\r\nas an advocate. Pliny saw military service in Germany,\r\nvisited Gaul, and became a procurator in Spain. After\r\na stay in Rome during which he completed his Natural\r\nHistory, dedicating it to Titus, he was appointed by Vespasian\r\nprefect of the fleet at Misenum. He was stationed there\r\nat the time of the eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed\r\nPompeii and Herculaneum in A.D. 79, and he owed his\r\ndeath to his desire to observe that phenomenon more\r\nclosely. Pliny's education, his career, his opinions, and his\r\ncharacter are all typical of the Italian tradition of his day.\r\n\r\nAs a writer this erudite and much travelled man exhibits\r\ngreat industry and an interest in natural phenomena that\r\nis quite uncontrolled by any real scientific standards.\r\nLearned and curious, Pliny is entirely devoid of critical\r\nfaculty. In his Naturalis historia he collected an enormous\r\namount of material, entirely unsifted, and this work his\r\nnephew rightly spoke of as an 'opus diffusum, eruditum,\r\nnec minus varium quam ipsa natura.' By Gibbon it was\r\ndescribed as 'that immense register where Pliny has deposited\r\nthe discoveries, the arts and the errors of mankind.'\r\nIt was drawn from about 2,000 works--most of them now\r\nlost--by 146 Roman and 326 Greek authors. The Natural\r\nHistory of Pliny, to which we shall frequently refer, may",

They are\r\ndistributed thus:\r\n\r\n(1)   Book 1.    Introductory.\r\n(2)   \" 2.       Cosmology.\r\n(3)   \" 3-6.    Geography.\r\n(4)   \" 7.       Anthropology.\r\n(5)   \" 8-11.

Natural objects are hardly described as\r\nsuch but only in relation to man. All things have their\r\n'uses.' 'Nature and the earth,' he says, 'fill us with\r\nadmiration ... as we contemplate the great variety of\r\nplants and find that they are created for the wants or enjoyment\r\nof mankind.' This world of wonder is, however,\r\neffectively without a God and works by rule--though it is\r\na somewhat crazy rule which these disordered, credulous,\r\nwonder-loving volumes set before us. 'It is mere folly to\r\ninquire into the nature of God ... ridiculous to suppose\r\nthat the great head of all things regards human affairs.'\r\nYet in this world in which he lives man himself occupies\r\na quite peculiar and not always enviable position. 'While\r\nother animals,' he says, 'have an instinctive knowledge\r\nof their own powers ... only man is helpless without\r\ninstruction. He alone desires honours and possessions ...\r\nhe alone provides for his grave and even for his future after\r\ndeath.... All other animals live at peace with their kind\r\n... but verily with man, most of his misfortunes are\r\nman's doings,'--Man the beast of prey! Lupus est homo\r\nhomini, non homo quom qualis sit non noscit, 'A man is not\r\nhuman but vermin to a stranger'--so Plautus (died 184 B.C.)\r\nhad written long ago.",
  "p014.png": "\r\nMany of the matters on which Pliny expresses a judgement\r\nwould have been impressed on him in the manifold\r\nlife of Imperial Rome. Many of the animals he discusses\r\nwere brought to the capital from the furthest ends of the\r\nearth, for the arena or for the kitchen. So too with plants.\r\nPliny describes a botanic garden kept by a Roman for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the medical and allied properties\r\nof herbs. In descriptions of living creatures Pliny goes\r\nback to Aristotle and Theophrastus, but there is no systematic\r\nbuilding of the subject and he is scientifically far\r\ninferior to his sources. Medical plants are treated in greatest\r\ndetail and he holds the view that all plants have their own\r\nspecial medical powers. The thought that nature exists\r\nfor man constantly recurs. His philosophy, which accords\r\nin general with the Stoic scheme, is largely drowned\r\nand lost in his love of detail and is often submerged\r\nin rhetoric.\r\n\r\nSeneca (3 B.C.-A.D. 65) has gone over to the Greeks even\r\nmore fully than either Varro or Pliny. Lucius Annaeus\r\nSeneca was born at Cordova and his mother appears to have\r\nbeen a native Spanish lady. At an early age he came to\r\nRome and there he spent practically all his life. He came\r\nunder Stoic influence and made his mark as an advocate.\r\nSeneca became praetor and consul, acted as tutor to Nero,\r\nand is said to have amassed a colossal fortune. After his\r\npupil's accession he showed himself subservient to that\r\nmonster's designs. Nero ultimately turned against him,\r\nand Seneca, having been ordered to prepare for death,\r\nanticipated his sentence. His end is described in a powerful\r\npassage by Tacitus.\r\n\r\nA provincial and a member of one of the newer families,\r\na brilliant rhetorician with a passion for philosophy, of\r\nwhich he was an eloquent but unsystematic exponent,\r\na man whose undoubted balance and judgement had been\r\nearned in affairs rather than in action, with an interest in\r\nnature rather in its cosmical than in its detailed aspects,",
  "p015.png": "Seneca provides in many respects an interesting contrast\r\nto his contemporary Pliny. If inferior in character, Seneca\r\nis the larger-minded of the two. His work is less typical\r\nperhaps of the Roman attitude, but it is the more philosophical\r\nand far more critical. Yet his Quaestiones naturales,\r\neven more than the Naturalis historia of Pliny, is borrowed\r\nmaterial. The number of direct observations that it contains\r\nis small. Seneca is distinctly less credulous than Pliny,\r\nbut just for this reason he fails to preserve so much interesting\r\nmaterial. The chief importance of his work is that it\r\nexhibits the attitude to nature of the more philosophical--and,\r\nwe would add, rhetorical--Romans of his day.\r\n\r\nSeneca is a Stoic, but does not hesitate to criticize the\r\nopinions of the school to which it is evident he is but loosely\r\nattached. The subject of the Quaestiones naturales is a\r\ngeneral account of natural phenomena, but as such it is\r\nill arranged and imperfect. It deals chiefly with Astronomy\r\nand Meteorology together with Physical Geography, exhibiting\r\na special interest in earthquakes and allied phenomena.\r\nSeneca fell into that trap which had caught so many\r\nGreeks before him, the confusion of philosophy with\r\nscience. It was a habit of many ancient writers that they\r\nwould only consider phenomena in relation to their conception\r\nof the world scheme as a whole. Even the medical\r\nsystem of antiquity suffered from this tendency, though\r\nCelsus assures us that it had been his master Hippocrates\r\nhimself 'who first separated medicine from philosophy.'\r\nOur author, who was called by Dante 'Seneca morale,'\r\nwas especially interested in Ethics, a moralist first and physicist\r\nor scientist afterwards. Physics--which for him meant\r\na general description of the Universe--led to a knowledge of\r\nman's destiny and through that to a consideration of man's\r\nduty. 'Some moral significance,' he tells us, 'should\r\nbe attached to all studies and all discussion. Whether we\r\nseek into the secrets of nature or treat of divine things, the\r\nsoul must be delivered from its errors and from time to\r\ntime reassured.'",
  "p016.png": "\r\nAt the end of each book Seneca sums up the moral to\r\nbe derived from the phenomena investigated. This is\r\noften of the most distant and strained character. Thus,\r\nterminating his discussion of the phenomena of light, he\r\nasks, 'What were nature's purposes in providing material\r\ncapable of receiving and reflecting images?' And he\r\nanswers, 'Firstly her motive was to show us the sun with\r\nhis glare dulled, since our eyes are too weak to gaze at him\r\ndirect, and without something to reflect him we should\r\nbe wholly ignorant of his shape.... Secondly we should\r\nbe unable to see or investigate that conjunction of the two\r\nheavenly bodies by which the daylight is wont to be interrupted\r\n[in eclipses], unless we could examine the reflections\r\nof sun and moon in basins on the ground with comparative\r\nfreedom. Thirdly mirrors were discovered in order that\r\nman might know himself.'\r\n\r\nSuch a point of view appealed greatly to the Middle Ages.\r\nIt was a standpoint very acceptable to the mediaeval Church,\r\nby which Seneca was regarded as a Christian. He was\r\nincluded by St. Jerome among the scriptores ecclesiastici,\r\nand is frequently quoted by later Christian writers. But\r\nthis exclusively ethical attitude is inconsistent with the\r\neffective advancement of knowledge and has been one\r\nof the greatest enemies of science. In spite of the\r\nnobility of his sentiments, in spite of his lip-service to\r\nthe advancement of knowledge, in spite of his belief\r\nin human destiny, Seneca's ethical attitude could do\r\nnothing to stay the downfall of ancient wisdom. To\r\nthat downfall and to Seneca's relation to it we shall\r\nlater return.\r\n\r\nThe works of Pliny and Seneca differ from those of most\r\nof the authors that we have to consider in that they were\r\nnot 'discovered' by the Renaissance humanists. Pliny and\r\nSeneca were indeed never lost, and their works formed\r\npart of the reading of the Dark and Middle Ages. For the\r\nunderstanding of mediaeval thought a knowledge of these\r\nauthors is necessary.",
  "p017.png": "\r\n\u00a7 3. Medical and Veterinary Knowledge\r\n\r\nThe original native Roman medical system was quite\r\ndevoid of scientific elements and was that of a people of the\r\nlower culture. Interwoven, as is all primitive medicine,\r\nwith ideas that trespass on the domain of religion, it\r\npossessed that multitude of 'specialist deities' which was\r\nso characteristic of the Roman cults. Thus Fever had\r\nthree temples in Rome, and was supplicated as the goddess\r\nFebris and flatteringly addressed as Febris diva, Febris sancta,\r\nFebris magna. Foul odours were invoked in the name of\r\nMephitis, to whom a temple was erected at a place where\r\nasphyxiating fumes emerged from the earth. Lassitude\r\nwas implored as Fessonia. Uterina guarded the womb,\r\nand Lucina, assisted by a whole group of goddesses, had\r\ncharge of childbirth. The entire pantheon of disease and\r\nphysiological function was presided over by the Dea Salus,\r\nwhose temple was on one of the summits of the Quirinalis.\r\nShe was the deity who took the public health under her\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nSome of the surviving records of the original Roman\r\nmedicine are of even lower material. Cato the Censor\r\nassures us that the ancient Rome, which he lauded, was\r\nsine medicis sed non sine medicina, 'healthy without doctors.'\r\nHe advised that to a sick ox be given three grains of salt,\r\nthree laurel leaves, three rue leaves, and various other threes\r\nfor three consecutive days, both patient and physician\r\nfasting and the drug being given when both were standing\r\nerect. For human patients his panacea was cabbage. He\r\nsought to reduce dislocations by reciting over them the\r\neuphonious formula,\r\n\r\nHuat hanat huat ista pista sista domiabo damnaustra.\r\n\r\nStudents of folk-lore have shown that magical jingles can\r\noften be traced back to a forgotten tongue, but that of Cato\r\nsuggests the expletive lingua franca still used by the victims\r\nof such accidents!\r\n\r\nThe entire external aspect of Roman medicine was grad-*",
  "p018.png": "*ually changed by the advent of Greek science. There is\r\nevidence, however, that the change hardly penetrated below\r\nthe upper classes. Thus in medical works of the fourth\r\nand fifth centuries of the Christian era we still encounter\r\nnumerous survivals of the older material. There are also\r\nmany references in St. Augustine's De civitate dei which\r\nshow that the ancient beliefs were widely current in Italy\r\neven among the well-to-do of his day. After the fall of\r\nthe Empire they lingered among the barbaric peoples that\r\nentered into its heritage. Nor are they yet extinct, for prescriptions\r\nand practices of Pliny, of Marcellus Empiricus,\r\nand of Sextus Placitus Papyriensis may still be traced in the\r\nfolk-customs and folk-beliefs of our own land and in the\r\nsayings and doings of continental peasantry.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large medical field that the Western\r\nEmpire provided, and the wide acceptance of Greek medicine\r\nby the upper classes, it is remarkable that the Latin-speaking\r\npeoples produced no eminent physician. During\r\nthe Republic medical education had been entirely a matter\r\nof private teaching. The relation of pupil and master\r\nexhibited by the Hippocratic oath was evidently that which\r\nprevailed under the early Empire. The initiate declared,\r\n'I will reckon him who taught me this Art as dear to me as\r\nthose who bore me. I will look upon his offspring as my\r\nown brethren and will teach them this art, if they would\r\nlearn it, without fee or stipulation. By precept, lecture,\r\nand every other mode of instruction, I will impart a knowledge\r\nof this art to my own sons, and to those of my teacher,\r\nand to disciples bound by a stipulation and an oath, according\r\nto the Law of Medicine, but to none other' (see p. 22).\r\n\r\nDespite the Ionic Greek dress in which this formula is\r\nknown to us, there is evidence that it is of Imperial date\r\nand of Roman rather than of Greek origin. The very\r\nform of the oath suggests the arrangements which were\r\ngradually made for medical instruction at Rome. The\r\nfirst important teacher there was the Greek Asclepiades",
  "p019.png": "of Bithynia (died c. 40 B.C.), a contemporary of Lucretius\r\nand like him an Epicurean. Asclepiades introduced the\r\natomic view of Democritus into medicine. He deeply\r\ninfluenced the course of later medical thought, ridiculed the\r\nHippocratic attitude of relying on the vis medicatrix naturae,\r\n'the healing power of nature' which he regarded as a mere\r\n'meditation on death,' and urged that active measures\r\nwere needed for the process of cure to be cito, tuto, iucunde,\r\n'seemly, swift, and sure.' He founded a regular school at\r\nRome which continued after him.\r\n\r\nAn outline of the history of this school and of others\r\nformed in Rome can be made out with some approach to\r\nclearness. At first the school was the mere personal following\r\nof the physician, who took his pupils and apprentices\r\nround with him on his visits. At a later stage such groups\r\ncombined to form societies or colleges, where questions of\r\nthe art were debated. Towards the end of the reign of\r\nAugustus or the beginning of that of Tiberius, these societies\r\nconstructed for themselves a meeting-place on the Esquiline,\r\nthe so-called Schola medicorum. It had a president with the\r\ntitle of archiatrus and a secretary known as the tabularius\r\nor scriba. Finally the emperors built halls or auditoria\r\nfor the teaching of medicine. The professors at first\r\nreceived only the pupils' fees. It was not until the time of\r\nVespasian (emperor A.D. 70-9) that medical teachers were\r\ngiven a salary at the public expense. The system was\r\nextended by Hadrian (117-38) and Alexander Severus\r\n(222-35).\r\n\r\nThus Rome became a centre of medical instruction.\r\nAfter a time subsidiary centres were established in other\r\nItalian towns. From Italy the custom spread and we meet\r\ntraces of such schools at the half Greek Marseilles, as well\r\nas at Bordeaux, Arles, N\u00eemes, Lyons, and Saragossa. From\r\nMarseilles, which had been the home of the geographers\r\nand astronomers Pytheas and Euthymenes, came the\r\nphysicians Crinas and Charmis. The latter, though accustomed\r\nto bathe his patients in ice-cold water in the depth",
  "p020.png": "of winter, received one of the highest medical fees mentioned\r\nin antiquity. Marseilles too was the home of Demosthenes,\r\nthe most renowned of ancient oculists, who lived under\r\nNero, and whose works were much sought after and survived\r\nat least as late as the fourteenth century. Bordeaux\r\ndid itself no great honour in giving to the world Marcellus\r\nEmpiricus, who had high office under Theodosius I (379-395)\r\nand Arcadius (396-408), and has left us a book which\r\nrepresents wellnigh the low water-mark of superstitious\r\nfolly. For the most part, however, these provincial schools\r\nproduced workaday medical men, few of whose writings\r\nhave come down to us. They were perhaps largely training\r\nplaces for the army surgeons. That class seldom had\r\nliterary interests, though Dioscorides, one of the most\r\nprominent physicians of antiquity and one who earned the\r\nrespect of Galen and has deeply influenced the modern\r\npharmacopoeia, served in the army under Nero. Dioscorides,\r\nhowever, wrote in Greek, and his work was probably\r\nnot translated until the sixth century.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the topic of medical instruction it will\r\nbe in place to say a word concerning the study of anatomy.\r\nThe practical study of that subject had been carried on at\r\nAlexandria, beginning with Herophilus and Erasistratus\r\nabout 300 B.C. Physiology had been experimentally studied,\r\nand the terrible charge of vivisection of human beings is\r\nmade against the school of Alexandria by Tertullian\r\n(c. 155-c. 222) and Augustine (354-430), who are supported\r\nby the very damning evidence of Celsus. Dissection of the\r\ndead body was still practised at Alexandria towards the end\r\nof the first century B.C., but it is probable that it had ceased\r\nby the middle of the second century A.D. It is clear that it\r\nwas on the bodies of animals that Galen (A.D. 130-200), for\r\ninstance, relied for his anatomical knowledge. Considering\r\nthe indifference to human life which the Romans often\r\nexhibited, considering their brutality to slaves and the\r\nopportunities offered by gladiatorial combats, considering",
  "p021.png": "the obvious value of anatomical knowledge for surgical\r\npractice and the organization of the military medical service\r\nof the Empire, it is truly remarkable that the anatomical\r\nknowledge of antiquity was thus allowed to lapse. It did\r\nnot revive until the rise of the mediaeval universities (p. 94).\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to the literature of medicine. The\r\nearliest scientific medical work in Latin is the De re medica\r\nof Celsus which was prepared about A.D. 30. It is of great\r\ninterest as our one adequate representative of the surgery\r\nof the Alexandrian period. Written in excellent Latin,\r\nit is in many ways the most readable and well-arranged\r\nancient medical work that we have. All the evidence,\r\nhowever, points to this work of Celsus having been a compilation\r\nif not a translation from the Greek, and the sole\r\nsurviving part of a complete encyclopaedia of knowledge.\r\nMany of its phrases are closely reminiscent of the 'Hippocratic\r\nCollection.' The ethical tone is high and the general\r\nline of treatment sensible and humane. Celsus, though\r\nalmost unknown to the Middle Ages, was the first classical\r\nmedical writer to be printed, his work appearing at Florence\r\nin 1478.\r\n\r\nThe treatise of Celsus is divided into eight books. It\r\nopens with an interesting account of the history of medicine\r\ncontaining a comparison of the rival sects of the so-called\r\n'Dogmatic' and 'Empiric' physicians. The first two\r\nbooks deal with diet and the general principles of therapeutics\r\nand pathology, the third and fourth discuss internal\r\ndiseases, the fifth and sixth external diseases. The seventh\r\nand eighth books, devoted to surgery, are perhaps the\r\nmost valuable. Celsus professes himself a follower of\r\nAsclepiades of Bithynia (died c. 40 B.C.), but, unlike his\r\nmaster, he by no means despises the Hippocratic expectant\r\nmethod of 'waiting on the disease.' In many matters his\r\ncomparative boldness as a surgeon will draw the attention\r\nof the modern medical reader. Thus he describes plastic\r\noperations on the face and mouth, and the removal of",
  "p022.png": "polypus from the nose. He tells too of the very dangerous\r\noperations for extirpating a goitre and of cutting for stone.\r\nHe gives an excellent account of what might be thought\r\nthe modern operation for removal of tonsils. Noteworthy\r\nalso is his description of dental practice, which includes\r\nthe wiring of loose teeth and an account of what appears\r\nto have been a dental mirror. An idea of the surgical instruments\r\nin use in his time can be obtained from those which\r\nhave been recovered from Pompeii, some of which are displayed\r\nin Fig. 7. At the top is shown a pair of forceps of\r\na form used in removing a long uvula. Below, from left\r\nto right, are arranged a long forceps with pointed ends, a\r\nsmall pair of scissors, a pair of dental forceps, and a small\r\npair of tweezers. To the right there is placed a pair of blunt\r\nforceps above and an instrument for scarification below.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Latin medical writings that we possess\r\nare not of high scientific value. Surviving works are ascribed\r\nto Antonius Musa, the medical attendant of Augustus.\r\nThe attribution, however, is spurious, and, after Celsus,\r\nthe first Latin medical author whose writings have survived\r\nis probably Scribonius Largus, a physician of the so-called\r\n'Empiric' school. He practised at Rome under Claudius,\r\nwhom he accompanied in A.D. 43 on his expedition to\r\nBritain, and he was physician to the Empress Messalina.\r\nHis receipt book is derived entirely from Greek sources\r\nof the lower type. He follows the unscientific method,\r\nwhich became very popular in the Middle Ages, of beginning\r\nwith the head and working down to the feet, entirely disregarding\r\nthe relations and functions of the organs. This\r\nmethod of classifying diseases by their position in the body\r\nis very ancient and is encountered in an Egyptian medical\r\npapyrus of about 1700 B.C. Scribonius is the earliest\r\nwriter who makes mention of the so-called Hippocratic oath,\r\nand has been praised because some of the unguents that he\r\nemployed for wounds had antiseptic qualities.\r\n\r\nAfter Scribonius Largus the most ancient Latin medical\r\nwork is that of Pliny. He was a scorner of medical science",

'Medicine,\r\nin spite of its lucrativeness,' says Pliny, 'is the one art of\r\nGreeks that the serious Roman has so far refused to cultivate.\r\nFew of our fellow-citizens have been willing even to\r\ntouch it, and if they do so they desert at once to the Greeks....\r\nUnfortunately there is no law to punish ignorant\r\nphysicians, and capital punishment is never inflicted on\r\nthem. Yet they learn by our suffering and experiment by\r\nputting us to death.' The collection of Pliny, which was to\r\nbe a substitute for the works of these wretched Greeks, consists\r\nof a vast series of remedies built on the supposedly\r\nfirm ground of 'experience.' It is based on no theory, it\r\nis supported by no doctrine, it is founded on no experiment.\r\nYet it is the prototype of the medical output of\r\nthe next fifteen hundred years. The cry of Pliny for\r\n'experience' as against 'theory' has been plaintively\r\nechoed by the 'practical' man down the ages. Yet there\r\nare subjects and there are conditions in which the man\r\nwithout a theory may be the most unpractical of all.\r\nMedicine is such a subject and disease is such a condition.\r\n\r\nWhen 'experience' is invoked in medical matters by\r\nPliny and by later writers, the absence of the parallel to\r\nthe 'experience' of many other affairs of life is often missed.\r\nIn other matters the so-called experience is usually under\r\nsome sort of control, and therefore in fact approaches the\r\ncharacter of 'experiment.' Experience is thus frequently\r\nbut the result of a series of observations provoqu\u00e9es. With\r\nclinical medicine, so long as it is uncontrolled by the ancillary\r\nsciences, this can seldom be the case. A single instance\r\nfrom Pliny will suffice. 'The herb dittany,' he says, 'has\r\nthe power to extract arrows. This was proved by stags\r\nwho had been struck by these missiles which were loosened\r\nwhen they fed on this plant.' Had Pliny made any effort to\r\nverify such a statement? He had take his 'experience,' in\r\nfact, from an interpolated and spurious passage of a work\r\nby Theophrastus, and he omits to mention his source. Pre-*possession\r\nwith the idea of the value of such experience",
  "p024.png": "led Pliny and the ages which followed him into innumerable\r\nabsurdities into which it would be profitless to follow them.\r\nBut if the multitudinous remedies of Pliny are always\r\nuseless and often disgusting, yet his book contains some\r\nvaluable material for the history of medicine, culled from\r\nmany sources now lost. His very discursiveness and love\r\nof gossip are our gain, and though he can do nothing to\r\nadvance medical knowledge he gives us much insight into\r\nmedical practice in antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe latter medical writings in the Latin language are\r\nhardly worth notice here. Some, such as those of Priscianus\r\n(c. 380), Marcellus (c. 400), and (pseudo-)Apuleius Barbarus\r\n(? c. 400), contemptible in themselves, are of interest for the\r\ninfluence they had on after ages. One writer, Quintus\r\nSerenus Sammonicus (c. 250), is remarkable for having\r\nintroduced into Latin the foolish custom of writing medical\r\nworks in verse. He is also the first to record the famous\r\ndevice or charm known as the Abracadabra. Another late\r\nLatin medical writer, Vindicianus (c. 400), less futile than\r\nmost, was the friend of St. Augustine. Important for a\r\nspecial reason is Caelius Aurelianus, a Numidian physician\r\nof the fifth century. His work is of philological interest\r\nand is also noticeable as one of the few remnants of the so-called\r\n'Methodist' school. It is, however, a translation\r\nfrom the Greek Soranus and not a native work. The last\r\nLatin medical writer of antiquity is probably Cassius Felix,\r\nan African, whose language is interesting but whose work,\r\nwritten in 447, consists only of extracts from earlier writers.\r\n\r\nVeterinary medicine was a topic on which the Roman\r\nagricultural interests concentrated considerable attention.\r\nAn important source for much of their material was a work\r\nby the Carthaginian Mago (c. 200 B.C.), which was translated\r\ninto both Latin and Greek. The earlier Latin works\r\non agriculture--Cato, Varro, Columella--naturally include\r\nmany passages which discuss the treatment of sick animals,\r\nand there is evidence that they draw largely on Mago.",
  "p025.png": "The Georgics of Virgil (written 31 B.C.) is really a manual\r\nof agriculture in verse. In the third book of the Georgics\r\nVirgil deals with the care and breeding of animals, and he\r\nspeaks of epizootic diseases such as scabies in sheep, foot-rot,\r\nanthrax, rabies, and sheep-rot. Much veterinary\r\ninformation may be gleaned from the works of Pliny. A\r\ncurious collection of remedies for diseases of cattle has come\r\ndown to us under the name of Gargilius Martialis\r\n(c. A.D. 200); it is interesting as an example of late Roman\r\nveterinary medicine with little or no Greek influence. The\r\nagricultural writer Palladius, who flourished in the fourth\r\ncentury, gives an account of the points of horses and describes\r\nhow to tell their age by the teeth. The work\r\nexercised some influence on the Middle Ages and was\r\ntranslated into English as early as 1420.\r\n\r\nBy far the best known and most complete Latin veterinary\r\nwork is the Digestorum artis mulomedicinae Libri IV by\r\nFlavius Vegetius Renatus (383-450), who is known also as\r\na writer on military topics. The treatise is remarkably\r\nscientific and well arranged, considering the period at which\r\nit was composed; especially noteworthy is the contempt\r\nexpressed in it for incantations and other superstitious\r\npractices. It had been studied by Petrarch and was the\r\nfirst veterinary work to be printed (Rome, 1487). Vegetius\r\nhas been called the 'father of veterinary science'; it is\r\ncertain, however, that he was a compiler, and among his\r\nsources is the Mulomedicinia Chironis translated from\r\nGreek by one Claudius Hermerus (c. 300 A.D.?). The\r\nwork of Hermerus survives and is of great philological\r\nimportance as a record of Low Latin linguistic forms.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 4.

Rome was\r\nalready provided with cloacae or subterranean sewers in\r\nthe age of the Tarquins (6th cent. B.C.). Similar conduits\r\nhave been found in excavations in Crete of Minoan date,\r\nbut there is evidence that the idea reached Rome from\r\n\r\nFig. 8.--Plan of the course of the Cloaca Maxima through the city\r\nto its outlet in the Tiber.\r\n\r\nEtruscan sources. Tradition is probably just in referring\r\nthe construction of the Cloaca maxima itself, the main drain\r\nof Rome [Figs. 8 and 9], to the period of monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe growth of hygienic ideas is seen in the interdict by\r\nthe 'Law of the Twelve Tables' (450 B.C.) against burials\r\nwithin the city walls. It is noteworthy that this order is\r\nmade without reference to any physician. The same absence\r\nof professional medical intervention may be noted in the\r\ninstructions issued to the aediles to attend to the cleanliness\r\nof the streets and to the distribution of water.

Their\r\nstatus was greatly improved by Julius Caesar, who, Suetonius\r\n(c. A.D. 120) tells us, 'conferred citizenship on all\r\nwho practised medicine at Rome ... to make them\r\nmore desirous of living in the city and to induce others to\r\nresort to it.' The finest monument to the Roman care\r\nfor the public health stands yet for all to see in the remains\r\nof the fourteen great aqueducts which supplied the city\r\nwith 300,000,000 gallons of potable water daily. No\r\nmodern city is better equipped in this regard. The Roman\r\nmilitary writer Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. A.D. 40-103)\r\nhas left us a good account of these aqueducts and their\r\nhistory in his De aquis urbis Romae. The distribution of\r\nwater to individual houses was also well cared for, and\r\nexcellent specimens of Roman plumbing may be seen in\r\nthe British Museum [Fig. 10]. A large number of other\r\nsanitary devices have survived in many sites and are particularly\r\nwell seen at Timgad in Algeria [Fig. 11].\r\n\r\nUnder the early Empire a definite public medical service\r\nwas constituted. Public physicians or archiatri, as they\r\nwere later called, were appointed to the various towns and\r\ninstitutions. Alexander Severus (222-35) organized the\r\nmedical service of the imperial house. The archiaters of\r\nthe palace were sometimes promoted to provincial governorships,\r\nas happened to Ausonius (c. 320), father of the poet,\r\nwho became prefect of Illyria, or to Vindicianus (c. 400),\r\nthe friend of Augustine, who became proconsul of Africa.\r\nAt a yet later date the first archiater of the sacred palace\r\nwas invested with the function of judging disputes between\r\nphysicians. 'We decorate you from this moment,' says\r\nCassiodorus (490-585) to one of them in his usual pompous\r\nand roundabout style, 'with the honour of being head\r\nof the archiaters, that you alone among the masters of health\r\nmay be pre-eminent, and that all those who exercise their\r\ningenuity on the subtleties of mutual contradictions may\r\nrefer to your judgement.

When the plunger descended it forced the water from the cylinder into the\r\ncentral delivery tube through another flap valve in the horizontal pipe.\r\n\r\nphysicians spread early from Italy to Gaul and to the other\r\nprovinces. A statute of Antoninus of about the year A.D. 160\r\nregulates the appointment of these physicians. 'The\r\nsmallest towns may have five physicians who may enjoy\r\nimmunity from taxation....

These numbers may not be surpassed either\r\nby an ordinance of the curia or by any other means soever,\r\nbut it is lawful to diminish them if this is done in view of\r\nthe civil charges.' The main duty of these physicians was\r\nto attend to the needs of the poor. In the code of Justinian\r\n(A.D. 533) there is an article urging them to give this service\r\ncheerfully rather than the more subservient attendance\r\non the wealthy. Their salaries were fixed by the decuriones\r\nor municipal councillors. They were encouraged to undertake\r\nthe training of pupils. Inscriptions prove the existence\r\nof such municipal archiatri in many towns, and attest the\r\nrespect in which they were held.\r\n\r\nIt is in connexion with the army that we see the Roman\r\nmedical system at its best. The actual medical organization\r\nof the Roman army is, however, a very debatable topic,\r\nand information concerning it has to be gathered from very\r\nscattered sources. The matter may be thus summed up.\r\n'Each of the 25-30 legions of 10 cohorts (numbering\r\n6,500-7,000 men in all) had a legionary physician (medicus\r\nlegionis); each of the 9 pretorian cohorts, the 4 urban\r\ncohorts, and the 7 cohorts of vigiles (who acted as police\r\nand firemen in the city) had four cohort surgeons (medici\r\ncohortis). Every body of auxiliary troops and every ship\r\nof the pretorian fleet had also its physician. All these\r\nphysicians, as part of the military establishment, were\r\nregarded as immunes, exempt from guard and combat-duty\r\nor day-labour, and ranked among the principales (non-commissioned\r\nofficers). In the pretorian and city cohorts,\r\nthey were required to be Roman citizens, while the physicians\r\nof the vigiles and auxiliary troops, serving in Italy and\r\nthe provinces, could be freedmen or foreigners. For this\r\nreason, the staff surgeons of these latter organizations were\r\ncalled medici ordinarii. The legionary physicians were\r\nall of equal rank, had no other medical superiors, and were\r\nsubordinated only to the camp commander (praefectus\r\ncastrorum) or, in his absence, to the tribunes of the legion.",
  "p030.png": "The social status of the medical staff in this military hierarchy\r\nwas that of the innumerable grades of non-commissioned\r\npersonnel and of the highly elaborated bureaucracy\r\nattached to the army, which included accountants, notaries,\r\nregistrars, secretaries, and civilian functionaries of all kinds'\r\n(F. H. Garrison). The actual administration of first-aid\r\nby Roman military surgeons is represented on Trajan's\r\ncolumn [Fig. 12].\r\n\r\nThe great contribution of Rome to medicine--and it is\r\na very great one--is the hospital system. It is a scheme that\r\nnaturally arose out of the Roman genius for organization\r\nand is connected with the Roman military system. Among\r\nthe Greeks iatreia, 'surgeries,' were well known; they\r\nwere, however, the private property of the medical man.\r\nLarger institutions were connected with the Aesculapian\r\ntemples, but there is no evidence of scientific medical treatment\r\nin these places. In Republican times the Romans\r\nwere no better off, and the work of Cato shows that there\r\nwas no provision for sick slaves. A temple to Aesculapius\r\nhad been established on an island of the Tiber in Republican\r\ntimes. The island was ship-like in form. Part of it had\r\nbeen hewn to the shape of a ship's poop whereon the staff\r\nand serpent of Aesculapius and the head of the god were\r\ncarved; remains of these symbols can be seen there to this\r\nday [Fig. 13]. 'On this island of Aesculapius,' Suetonius\r\ntells us, 'certain men exposed their sick and worn-out slaves\r\nbecause of the trouble of treating them. The Emperor\r\nClaudius (A.D. 41-54), however, decreed that such slaves\r\nwere free, and, if they recovered, they should not return to\r\nthe control of their masters.' Thus the island became a\r\nplace of refuge for the sick poor. We may regard it as an\r\nearly form of public hospital.\r\n\r\nColumella (first century A.D.) speaks of valetudinaria,\r\n'infirmaries,' for such persons, and gives humane directions\r\nfor their management. Seneca tells us that valetudinaria\r\nwere in use even by free Romans. The excavations at",

At first sick soldiers had been sent\r\nhome for treatment. As the Roman frontiers spread ever\r\nwider this became impossible and military hospitals were\r\n\r\nFig. 14.--General Plan of Roman Military Hospital at Novaesium near D\u00fcsseldorf.\r\nThe assigning of the uses to the different parts of the building is conjectural.\r\n\r\nfounded at important strategic points.

It is built on the\r\ncorridor system.

This room was probably used as a refectory.",

Around this series of chambers\r\nruns another corridor also along three sides of the building,\r\nand around this outer corridor again is another series of\r\nchambers. These outer chambers are peculiarly arranged\r\nso that they do not open directly into the corridor, but each\r\npair is reached through a small vestibule. (See detail in\r\nFig. 14.) The arrangement must be related to sanitation,\r\nand traces of the drainage system have been uncovered.\r\nThe general scheme is much in advance of any military\r\nhospital until quite modern times.\r\n\r\nFrom the military valetudinarium it was no great step\r\nto the construction of similar institutions for the numerous\r\nimperial officials and their families in the provincial towns.\r\nMotives of benevolence, too, seem to have gradually come\r\nin, and finally public hospitals were founded in many\r\nlocalities. The idea naturally passed on to Christian times,\r\nand the pious foundation of hospitals for the sick and out-*cast\r\nin the Middle Ages is to be traced back to these Roman\r\nvaletudinaria. The first charitable institution of this kind\r\nconcerning which we have clear information was established\r\nat Rome in the fourth century by a Christian lady named\r\nFabiola of whom we learn from St. Jerome. The plan\r\nof such a hospital projected at St. Gall in the early years of\r\nthe ninth century has survived. It reminds us in many\r\nrespects of the early Roman military hospitals. These\r\nmediaeval hospitals for the sick must naturally be distinguished\r\nfrom the even more numerous 'spitals' for travellers\r\nand pilgrims, the idea of which may perhaps be traced back\r\nto the rest-houses along the strategic roads of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 5.

The\r\ndecimal system with which we are nowadays familiar is of\r\nIndian origin, and reached Europe through Arabic channels\r\nin the Middle Ages.

As both agricultural and town-planning\r\nwere mainly on rectangular lines this instrument was of\r\nwide application. A figure of it has been found on the grave\r\nof a Roman surveyor, and an actual specimen has been\r\nrecovered from Pompeii [Fig. 17].\r\n\r\nThat site has also yielded a number of compasses and other\r\napparatus employed in mensuration [Fig. 18].

This instrument is a device of\r\nconsiderable antiquity among them, and may be traced\r\nback at least as far as the third century B.C. Its use was\r\nwidely understood and many specimens\r\nhave been recovered [Fig. 20].\r\nThe principle of the pulley, too,\r\nwas well known. Thus on one of\r\nthe monuments we can follow the\r\nmechanism of a crane. It is worked\r\nby a treadmill and raises blocks of\r\nstone by acting through a whole system of\r\npulleys [Fig. 21].\r\n\r\nThe inadequate theoretical basis of the\r\nphysical conceptions of Latin writers is shown\r\nin various directions. Thus Pliny recounts a\r\nfable of the Remora, a fish of the Mediterranean\r\nwhich has a sucker on its head. 'This tiny\r\nfish can restrain all the forces of the ocean.\r\nWinds may rage and storms may roar, yet the\r\nfish restrains their might and fury, and causes\r\nships to stand still ... by simply adhering to\r\nthem.' Centuries before, Archimedes (287-212\r\nB.C.) had demanded 'a fixed place on\r\nwhich to stand that he might move the\r\nworld.' The full understanding of the\r\nworks of Archimedes failed for the next\r\nmillennium and a half. Yet his simpler practical devices,\r\nsuch as the water screw, were familiar enough to the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nSeneca is superior, scientifically, to Pliny. This in itself\r\nis no great distinction, but there are several passages in\r\nthe Quaestiones naturales which suggest that Seneca did\r\noccasionally take the trouble to verify some of the statements\r\nthat he makes. He has a clear idea too of the value\r\n\r\nFig. 20.--Roman steelyard,\r\nfrom a specimen\r\nin the British Museum.",

These bodies appear seldom and therefore we\r\ndo not yet know ... if they follow periodic laws and\r\nwhether some definite cause is responsible for their reappearance\r\nat the appointed day. Such a development of\r\nastronomy is but recent.' In spite of this statement of\r\nSeneca there is a passage in the Meteorologica of Aristotle\r\nwhich seems to ascribe the knowledge of the periodic\r\nreturn of comets to the Pythagoreans and to Hippocrates\r\nof Chios (c. 425 B.C.), five hundred years before the days\r\nof Seneca.\r\n\r\nSeneca's statement concerning the magnifying powers\r\nof glass globes is peculiarly noteworthy. Fallacious attempts\r\nhave been made to show that the ancients knew of the effect\r\nof refraction of light at curved surfaces. That they knew\r\nof the burning-glass is clear from references in Pliny and\r\nelsewhere, and many glass or crystal spheres, probably\r\nused as fire-makers, have been recovered from Roman\r\nsites. These burning glasses do not, however, seem to have\r\nbeen used for magnifying purposes, and Seneca has bequeathed\r\nto us one of the very few passages in ancient\r\nwritings that suggest that this power of transparent spheres\r\nhad even been noticed. He records that 'letters however\r\nsmall and dim appear large and clear when viewed through\r\na glass globe filled with water.' It has been claimed that\r\nglobes of this type were used by the gem cutters of antiquity,\r\nbut such suggestions are unsupported by evidence. The\r\noft-repeated statement that Nero used a cut emerald as a\r\nlens to aid his defective vision has arisen from a mistranslation\r\nof a passage in Pliny.\r\n\r\nApplied mathematics underwent some development at\r\nthe end of the Republican period.

Both of these\r\nprojects were ultimately realized.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Roman calendar is obscure.\r\nWe learn from Censorinus (fl. A.D. 238) and Macrobius\r\n(fl. A.D. 400) that the Roman year consisted at first of ten\r\nmonths and 304 days. Livy (59 B.C.-A.D. 17) and Plutarch\r\n(A.D. 46-120) give contradictory accounts of the reforms of\r\nNuma, who is said to have introduced a year of twelve months.\r\nIt is clear that at an early date there emerged a lunar year\r\nof 355 days which is almost exactly twelve lunations. Of this\r\ncalendar Martius (the month of Mars) was the first month,\r\nAprilis (probably for aperilis from aperire, 'to open'), Maius\r\n(perhaps related to major), and Junius (which may be related\r\nto junior and juvenis) were named in connexion with the\r\nopening, growth, and ripening of vegetation. The following\r\nsix months, Quinctilis, Sextilis, September, October, November,\r\nand December, were given merely the numerical names\r\nwhich most of them still bear. Januarius was perhaps\r\nnamed from the god Janus, and Februarius, the last month,\r\nwas the season of ritual purification (februare, 'to purify'\r\nor 'expiate'). To obtain some relation of this lunar\r\nreckoning to the solar year a cycle of four years had been\r\ninvented of which the first year contained 355 days, the\r\nsecond 377, the third 355, and the fourth 378. The\r\ncycle thus covered 1,465 days and the average year was of\r\n1465/4 = 366-1/4 days. It is obvious that so variable a year was\r\nuseless for agricultural purposes. The farmer had thus\r\nstill to rely on the rising and setting of certain constellations,\r\nsuch as Arcturus and the Pleiades, for timing his operations.\r\nThe year was variously modified at different periods, but\r\nuntil the reforms of Julius Caesar no adequate correspondence\r\nto solar events was attained.\r\n\r\nIn place of this system Julius Caesar, acting under the\r\nadvice of the Alexandrian mathematician Sosigenes, substituted\r\na solar year of 365 days and abandoned any attempt\r\nto adapt the years or months to the lengths of the lunations.",

These fourth or leap years became\r\nknown as 'bissextile' years. It is believed that this reform\r\nwas a reproduction of the Egyptian calendar that had been\r\nenacted in 238 B.C. and had been perhaps designed at a\r\nyet earlier date by the Greek astronomer Eudoxus (fl. c.\r\n350 B.C.). In 44 B.C., the second year of the Julian Calendar,\r\none of the months was named Iulius in honour of its founder.\r\nIn 8 B.C. another month was called Augustus after his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 6. Geography\r\n\r\nGeography in the limited sense as distinct from cosmography\r\nwas a topic that might be expected to appeal to the\r\npractical and imperialistically minded Roman. We learn\r\nof the existence of maps from a variety of Latin authors--Cicero,\r\nPliny, Seneca, Suetonius, and Vitruvius. From\r\nVarro we gain a hint of the early religious associations of\r\nland-surveying, for he tells us that a map of Italy engraved\r\non marble had a place in the temple of Tellus.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the Empire planned by Caesar may have\r\nbeen suggested, like his calendarial reform, by ideas culled\r\nfrom Alexandria. The division of the provinces, the demands\r\nof trade, the distribution of the fleet, all made the\r\nneed of this work evident. In the event the execution\r\nof the scheme fell to Augustus. The survey was superintended\r\nby his son-in-law M. Vipsanius Agrippa (died\r\n12 B.C.), and was finally carried through in 20 B.C. after\r\nnearly 30 years' work. Agrippa wrote a commentary\r\nillustrating this map, quotations from which have survived\r\nin the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus (c. A.D. 325-92)\r\nand Pliny. It was fairly accurate for the provinces of Italy,\r\nGreece, and Egypt, whereas other countries were only\r\nroughly surveyed.\r\n\r\nThe survey was rendered possible by the fact that the",
  "p041.png": "Empire was well furnished with roads marked out with\r\nmilestones. There was a regular service of skilled\r\nagrimensores or surveyors whose work, incorporated in\r\nthe reports of provincial governors and generals, would be\r\navailable at head-quarters. From this mass of material a\r\nhuge map was prepared which was exhibited in a building\r\nerected for the purpose. This was the prototype of later\r\nstrategical maps, a copy of one of which has survived to this\r\nday and is known as the Peutinger table after the sixteenth-century\r\nscholar who first published it. It was originally\r\ndrawn in the year A.D. 366, but the copy we have, which is\r\nnow at Vienna, was prepared in 1265. On it are shown the\r\nroutes for armies throughout the Empire. These routes\r\nare indicated by lines which are notched at intervals that\r\ncorrespond to a day's journey. The whole map is greatly\r\ndistorted by being enormously prolonged in the east-west\r\ndirection [Fig. 22 and Fig. 23]. It is evident that, in its\r\nconstruction, cartographical accuracy was less considered\r\nthan the purely practical aim of a convenient view of the\r\nitineraries. It may thus be compared to the distorted\r\nmaps issued by some of our railway companies. The unit\r\nis usually a Roman mile (a thousand steps = mille passuum =\r\n1,651 yards). Distances are sometimes indicated by figures.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the manner in which the main routes of\r\nthe Empire were surveyed and marked out may be gained\r\nfrom certain monuments, notably the inscribed marble\r\npillars of Autun (Augustodunum). The monument gives--or\r\ngave, for most of it is now lost--the distances of a number\r\nof places on the road from Autun to Rome such as Autessiodurum\r\n(Auxerre), Bononia (Bologna), and Mutina (Modena).\r\nSomewhat similar inscriptions--sometimes of the nature\r\nof simple milestones--have been found at Tongres in Belgium,\r\nin Luxembourg, at Valencia, near the Roman wall\r\nin Northumberland, and in other places.

Rutilius Namatianus of\r\nToulouse wrote in 417 a versified Itinerarium de reditu suo\r\nwhich gave an account of a journey from Rome to Gaul.\r\nHe was a pagan who fiercely attacked the monks--men who\r\ndread the evils without being able to support the blessings\r\nof the human condition. His work naturally delighted the\r\nheart of Gibbon, and is of interest as still exhibiting the\r\nfaith that Rome is immortal.

A.D. 150), and it is clear that Pomponius Mela is here\r\nborrowing mainly from Greek sources.\r\n\r\nMela next passes to a general description of the three\r\ncontinents, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is noteworthy that\r\nhe takes the river Tanais (the Don), lake Maeotis (the Sea\r\nof Azov), and the Euxine Sea (Pontus Euxinus, the Black\r\nSea) as the frontiers between Europe and Asia, while it is\r\nthe Nile that divides Asia from Africa. Asia is as large as\r\nEurope and Africa together. These ideas were passed on\r\nto the earlier Middle Ages and are expressed in the first\r\nEuropean world-map that has survived, which is in a\r\nseventh-century codex of Isidore (560-636) at St. Gall.\r\nBetween the three continents is the Mediterranean, which\r\nMela speaks of as 'our sea.' Mela proceeds to a detailed\r\ndescription of the different countries which is sufficiently\r\ndetailed for the lands and islands of the Mediterranean,\r\nbut becomes more vague as he passes from that area. He\r\nis singularly hazy as regards central Europe, which is\r\nremarkable when one considers the importance of the\r\nmilitary operations in progress in that area. His account\r\nof Britain may serve as a sample of his descriptions of\r\ncountries beyond his own immediate area.\r\n\r\n'Britain, according to present knowledge, extends in the\r\ndirections North and East. It offers a wide angle opposite\r\nthe mouths of the Rhine. One arm of this angle looks\r\ntowards Gaul, the other towards Germany. The two\r\nsides abut obliquely on a long straight line which terminates\r\nthem behind and gives the land a triangular form like that\r\nof Sicily. Britain is flat, large, and fertile, but her produce\r\nis more suitable for cattle than men. She has forests,\r\nlakes, and considerable rivers which flow with alternating\r\nmotion into the sea and towards their sources (according\r\nto the alternate movements of the tide); some of them\r\nproduce pearls and precious stones. The inhabitants ...\r\nare all savage and rich only in flocks. They paint the",
  "p047.png": "body either by way of ornament or from some other motive.\r\nThey make pretexts of war and often attack each other,\r\nimpelled solely by the ambition to command and to extend\r\ntheir borders. Armed like the Gauls, they fight not only\r\non foot and on horseback but also in chariots which they\r\ncall covini and which have scythes attached to their axles.\r\n\r\n'Beyond Britain is Ireland, stretching nearly as far and\r\nof an oblong form. Its climate is unfavourable for\r\nripening cereals, but it abounds in herbs of pleasant appearance\r\nand so sweet that the flocks fill themselves to repletion\r\nin a short part of the day, so that if not prevented from\r\neating they would burst with fatness. The natives are\r\nrude and more ignorant of the virtues and devoid of piety\r\nthan any other people.'\r\n\r\nThe haziness of the geographical ideas even of a very\r\nintelligent Roman of Imperial times may be gathered from\r\nthe pages of Tacitus (c. A.D. 55-120). He tells how,\r\nunder Agricola, the Roman fleet rounded Britain and\r\nproved it to be an island, discovering at the same time the\r\nOrcades (Orkney Islands) and coming in sight of Thule,\r\nby which the Shetlands are perhaps meant. Yet Tacitus,\r\nlike Caesar and the elder Pliny, believes that Spain lies to the\r\nwest of Britain [Fig. 25]. He describes the Pyrenees as\r\nrunning north and south. He goes on to explain the\r\nphenomenon of the midnight sun--which he brings as far\r\nsouth as the North of Scotland--by telling us that 'the\r\nflat extremities of the earth, casting a low shadow, do not\r\nthrow the darkness up high, and the night does not reach to\r\nthe sky and stars.' This statement implies the view that\r\nthe earth is a disk with flattened edges.\r\n\r\nThe final geographical synthesis of antiquity was made by\r\nClaudius Ptolemaeus, who worked and observed at Alexandria\r\nduring the reigns of Hadrian (117-38[** 138]) and Antoninus\r\nPius (138-161), whom he survived. Ptolemy, who was no\r\nless important as a geographer than as an astronomer, wrote\r\nin Greek but worked on itineraries of Roman officials and",
  "p048.png": "merchants. Thus he may be said to preserve for us a\r\nsummary of Roman knowledge of the earth's surface,\r\npresented, however, in a way in which no Latin writer was\r\ncapable. Ptolemy is generally thought to have used the\r\nmap prepared by M. Vipsanius Agrippa which was placed\r\nin the porch of Pollux at Rome.\r\n\r\nPtolemy developed his own manner of representing the\r\ncurved surface of the earth on\r\na plane surface. In his scheme\r\nof projection the parallels of\r\nlatitude are arcs of concentric\r\ncircles, the centres of which\r\nare at the North Pole. Chief\r\namong the parallels are the\r\nEquator and circles passing\r\nrespectively through Thule,\r\nthrough Rhodes, and through\r\nMeroe. The meridians of\r\nlongitude are represented by\r\nstraight lines which converge\r\nto the Pole. He delineates in\r\nthis manner the whole of the\r\nthen known world, and the\r\nlimits that he sets give a clear\r\nidea of the range of geographical\r\nvision in Imperial Roman\r\ntimes. The boundaries of\r\nPtolemy's world are: on the\r\nnorth, the Ocean which surrounds\r\nthe British Isles, the northern parts of Europe,\r\nand the unknown land in the northern region of Asia;\r\non the south, the unknown land which encloses the Indian\r\nSea, and the unknown land to the south of Libya and\r\nAethiopia; on the east, the unknown land which adjoins\r\nthe eastern nations of Asia, the Sinae (Chinese) and the\r\npeople of Serica, the silk-producing land; on the west,\r\nthe great Western Ocean and unknown parts of Libya.\r\n\r\nFig. 25.--Map of Western Europe\r\nreconstructed from the descriptions of\r\nTacitus.

Many editions of it appeared\r\nadorned with reconstructed charts in the early years\r\nof printing.

Astronomy and Cosmology\r\n\r\nThe Romans did not deal with astronomical matters until\r\nfairly late and then mostly for practical purposes. They\r\nnever developed a mathematical astronomy such as that\r\nwhich formed the basis of Greek cosmological speculations.\r\nA bronze plaque has, however, been found at Salzburg\r\nwhich is engraved with the names and figures of constellations.\r\nPliny tells us that in his time there were 1,600 named\r\nstars. These bodies, he considered, were composed of fire\r\nand filled with air.\r\n\r\nPopular astronomy and geography are represented in\r\nLatin by certain poetical works bearing the name of Avienus\r\n(c. A.D. 380). The geographical poems of Avienus are\r\nadapted from Greek works by Dionysius Periegetes\r\n(c. A.D. 100), which were rendered again into Latin by Priscian\r\nin the sixth century. For his astronomical works Avienus\r\ndraws upon Greek treatises of Aratus of Soli (271-213 B.C.).\r\nTo one of these known as the Aratea Phaenomena quite\r\npeculiar interest is attached. St. Jerome tells us that when,\r\nin the Acts, St. Paul is reported as saying 'In him we live,\r\nand move, and have our being; as certain even of your own\r\npoets have said, For we are also his offspring' (Acts xvii. 28),\r\nhe is quoting the Aratea Phaenomena.

Both\r\nAratus and Cleanthes were claimed by the Stoics, who,\r\nwith the Epicureans, were opposing the apostle at Athens\r\n(Acts xvii. 18).\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome gives us also the approximate date of Avienus,\r\nfor he speaks of the Phaenomena\r\n'Arati, quem Cicero in Latinum\r\nsermonem transtulit et Germanicus\r\nCaesar et nuper Avienus,' 'which\r\nCicero and Germanicus Caesar\r\ntranslated into the Latin tongue\r\nand lately also Avienus.'

He says he borrowed the idea\r\nfrom Ctesibius (c. 120 B.C.), an ingenius barber of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the length of day in different latitudes\r\nwas well known to the Romans. From the fact that the\r\nlongest day in Alexandria was 14 hours, in Italy 15, and in\r\nBritain 17 hours, Pliny deduces that lands close to the pole\r\nmust have a 24-hours day around the summer solstice,\r\nand a 24-hours night in winter.\r\n\r\nMany passages in Pliny reflect a contest concerning\r\nthe form of the earth, reminding us of the similar",
  "p053.png": "dispute of the seventeenth century that turned around the\r\nname of Copernicus and the views of Galileo. Pliny\r\nopens his work with a description of the general\r\nstructure of the universe. With the theory of the spherical\r\nform of the earth had come the view that man was much\r\nmore widely distributed\r\nthan had been thought.\r\nThe general character\r\nof ancient mathematical\r\ngeography had been\r\nfixed by Eratosthenes,\r\nwho presided over the\r\nschool of Alexandria for\r\nmore than forty years,\r\ntill about 194 B.C. Geographical\r\ntheory had\r\naltered by little since\r\nhis time, but, with the\r\ndissemination of his\r\nsphericist view of the\r\nearth, the belief in the\r\nexistence of antipodean\r\nraces became not unusual\r\namong educated\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n'Science and the\r\nopinion of the mob,'\r\nsays Pliny, 'are in direct\r\nopposition. According\r\nto the former the whole\r\nsphere of the earth is inhabited by men whose feet point\r\ntowards each other while all have the heavens above their\r\nheads. But the mob ask how men on the antipodes do not\r\nfall off; as though that did not present the opposite query\r\nwhy they should not wonder at our not falling off. Usually,\r\nhowever, the crowd objects if one urges that water also\r\ntends to be spherical. Yet nothing is more obvious, since\r\n\r\nFig. 29.--Water clock described by Vitruvius.\r\nFrom the tank a water drips at a uniform rate\r\nthrough the small pipe B into the reservoir C in\r\nwhich is the float D.

  "p054.png": "hanging drops always form little spheres.' Among his\r\nproofs of the curved surface of the earth is the gradual\r\nappearance of ships, mast first, then hull, as they approach\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of the spherical form of the earth thus\r\nbecame the common belief of the educated during Imperial\r\ntimes. There were also individuals by whom the heliocentric\r\nteaching, of which the germ was among the Greeks,\r\nwas not entirely ignored. Copernicus fifteen hundred\r\nyears later sought to link his teaching to antiquity and\r\nquoted Cicero in support of his views.\r\n\r\nTo the moon and fixed stars the Romans had already in\r\nPliny's time began to attribute an influence on human\r\naffairs. 'Who does not know,' he asks, 'that when Sirius\r\nrises it exercises influence on the widest stretch of earth?'\r\nThe influence of the dog-star is an idea that may be traced\r\nback in Greek literature at least as far as Hesiod (8th century\r\nB.C.) and has given us our modern superstition of the 'dog\r\ndays.' It was recognized that the moon had influence on\r\ntides and it was thought that influencing the outer world,\r\nthe macrocosm, it had influence also on the body of man,\r\nthe microcosm. With the waxing of the moon it was\r\nbelieved that the muscles became bigger and blood increased.\r\nThis theory gave rise to the practice of periodical blood-*letting.\r\n\r\nThe supposed influence of the heavenly bodies on the\r\nearth and on the life of man is a topic that leads on to\r\njudicial astrology. A knowledge of that subject became\r\nunder the Empire a professional possession illegal and\r\nprohibited but often tolerated and resorted to even by\r\nemperors. Astrology was beginning to spread in Rome\r\nin the first century of the Christian era. 'There are\r\nthose,' Pliny tells us, 'who assign [all human events] to\r\nthe influence of the stars, and to the laws of their nativity.\r\nThey suppose that God, once for all, issues his decrees\r\nand never after interferes. This opinion begins to gain",
  "p055.png": "ground and both the learned and the vulgar are falling in\r\nwith it.' The art was of foreign origin. The credit of\r\nits invention is always ascribed to the 'Chaldaeans.'\r\nOrientals were certainly practising astrology in Rome from\r\nan early date, but the main channel of transmission was\r\nGreek. 'As for the branch of astronomy which concerns\r\nthe influences of the twelve signs of the zodiac, the five\r\nplanets and the sun and moon on man's life,' says Vitruvius,\r\n'we must leave it to the calculations of the Chaldaeans to\r\nwhom belongs the art of casting nativities, which enables\r\nthem to declare the past and future.'\r\n\r\nIt is largely against these Chaldaeans that Cicero directs\r\nhis dialogue On divination. He misunderstands the basis\r\nof astrology and marshals ancient and fallacious arguments\r\nagainst it. Yet even Cicero accepted some astrological\r\ndoctrine, and in his Dream of Scipio he spoke of the planet\r\nJupiter as helpful and Mars as harmful. To the early Christian\r\nwriters astrology was even more abhorrent, for it\r\nseemed to them to be the negation of that doctrine of free-will\r\nthat was so dear to them. Tertullian (c. 155-c. 222),\r\nLactantius (c. 260-c. 340), and Augustine (354-430) all\r\ninveigh against it. With the spread of Christianity in the\r\nWest and the disappearance of the Stoic philosophy, astrology\r\npassed into the background to return with the Arabian\r\nrevival and the rise of the Universities.\r\n\r\nA large literature arose on the subject, of which we have\r\nremains in the works of Manilius (1st century a.d.), Censorius\r\n(3rd century a.d.), and Firmicus Maternus (4th\r\ncentury a.d.). Nevertheless, astrology seems on the whole\r\nto have been rather less cultivated in Rome itself than the\r\ngeneral state of society and the wide spread of the Stoic\r\nphilosophy might perhaps suggest. Lovers sought to learn\r\nof astrologers a lucky day for a wedding, travellers inquired\r\nwhat was the best day for starting on a journey, and builders\r\nasked the correct date for laying a foundation stone. All\r\nthese may easily be paralleled by instances among the\r\nempty-headed in our own time and country. But Galen",
  "p056.png": "(A.D. 130-200), who practised among the well-to-do and\r\neducated, assures us that they only bothered about astrology\r\nfor forecasting legacies--and again a parallel might be drawn.\r\nThe new astrology introduced by Greeks and 'Chaldaeans'\r\ntended, however, to replace the native magical system.\r\nThe process can be observed in action in the work of\r\nCensorinus, De die natali.\r\n\r\nBut astrology must not be considered only as a superstition\r\nand an occupation for empty heads and idle hands.\r\nThe astrological system of antiquity was, after all, only a\r\nformal statement of the beliefs concerning the nature and\r\nworking of our mundane sphere which the ideas of a\r\nscientific astronomy and cosmology had fostered. Faith in\r\nit was almost part of the Stoic creed. In the presentment\r\nof the world which science thus made, there was no room for\r\nthose anthropomorphic gods, the belief in whom was still\r\nfostered by the priests and held by the multitude. The\r\nspread of science had led at last to a complete breach between\r\nthe official faith and the opinions of the educated classes.\r\nThe idea of 'universal solidarity,' of the interdependence\r\non one another of all parts of the universe, produced a\r\nnew form of religion. The world itself must be divine.\r\n'Deity,' says Pliny, 'only means nature.' From such a\r\nview to the monotheism of Virgil, in which the world as a\r\nwhole is regarded as the artistic product of an external god,\r\nis perhaps no great step.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, science, linked with Stoicism,\r\nfailed to take that step, and assumed among later Latin\r\nwriters a fatalistic and pessimistic mood. 'God, if God there\r\nbe, was outside the world and could not be expected to\r\ncare for it,' says Pliny. The idea of immortality seems to\r\nhim but the 'childish babble' of those who are possessed\r\nby the fear of death, as Lucretius had once maintained. After\r\ndeath, so Pliny would have us believe, man is as he was\r\nbefore he was born--and this he tells us as he plunges\r\ninto his magic-ridden pages!\r\n\r\nOnce and once only in these Latin scientific writings have",

It is significant that that note\r\nis sounded in connexion with a statement of a belief in the\r\nprogress of knowledge, an echo of the Greek thought of the\r\nfifth and fourth centuries B.C. It is significant too that the\r\nnote is sounded by one who approached, nearer perhaps\r\nthan any other pagan Latin philosopher, to the idea of the\r\ndivine immanence. In his Quaestiones naturales Seneca\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\nThere are many things akin to highest deity that are still obscure.\r\nSome may be too subtle for our powers of comprehension, others imperceptible\r\nto us because such exalted majesty conceals itself in the holiest\r\npart of its sanctuary, forbidding access to any power save that of the\r\nspirit. How many heavenly bodies revolve unseen by human eye!...\r\nHow many discoveries are reserved for the ages to come when our memory\r\nshall be no more, for this world of ours contains matter for investigation\r\nfor all generations.... God has not revealed all things to man and has\r\nentrusted us with but a fragment of His mighty work. But He who directs\r\nall things, who has established and laid the foundation of the world, who\r\nhas clothed Himself with Creation, He is greater and better than that\r\nwhich He has wrought. Hidden from our eyes, He can only be reached\r\nby the spirit.... On entering a temple we assume all signs of reverence.\r\nHow much more reverent then should we be before the heavenly bodies,\r\nthe stars, the very nature of God!\r\n\r\nBut the science of antiquity as exhibited elsewhere in Latin\r\nwritings contains very little of this belief in man's destiny,\r\nthis hope for human knowledge. The world in which\r\nthe Imperial Roman lived was a finite world bound by the\r\nfirmament and limited by a flaming rampart (Frontispiece).\r\nHis fathers had thought that great space peopled by numina,\r\n'divinities,' that needed to be propitiated. The new\r\ndispensation--that lex naturae of the world that had so\r\nmany parallels with the jus gentium of the Empire--had now\r\ntaken the place of those awesome beings.\r\n\r\nIn the inevitableness of the action of that law Lucretius\r\nthe Epicurean might find comfort from the unknown\r\nterror.

The Roman had forsaken\r\nhis early gods, that crowd of strangely vague yet personal\r\nbeings whose ceremonial propitiation in every event and\r\ncircumstance had filled his fathers' lives. He had had before\r\nhim an alternative of the oriental cults whose gods were\r\nbut mad magicians--a religion unworthy of a philosopher--and\r\nthe new religion of science whose god, he now saw,\r\nworked by a mechanical rule. He had abandoned the\r\nfaith of his fathers and had flung himself into the arms of\r\nwhat he believed to be a lovelier god, and lo! he found\r\nhimself embracing a machine! His soul recoiled and he\r\nfled into Christianity. Science had induced that essential\r\npessimism which clouds much of the thought of later\r\nantiquity.

The Limits of the Middle Ages of Science\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages, by general admission, present us with\r\na set-back in the development of scientific ideas. Between\r\nthe fall of the Empire and the revolution in physics carried\r\nthrough by Galileo in the seventeenth century, the conception\r\nas to the nature of the world in which they lived that\r\nprevailed among educated men was not conducive to the\r\nfirst-hand study of nature. It is because these views\r\nwere finally shattered by Galileo and his successors that\r\nmany of the authors whose works we shall have to discuss\r\nmay seem insignificant. Yet some of these men, who are\r\nnow well-nigh forgotten, have had their share in determining\r\nthe current of human thought and with it the course of\r\nhuman destiny. The test of importance that we must apply\r\nis not our assent to their opinions but the influence their\r\nworks have had on the period we are considering. We must\r\nremember, too, that the period has the intense interest of\r\npresenting us with the beginning of something, the birth--or\r\nrather the rebirth--of the scientific idea.",
  "p060.png": "\r\nWe cannot, then, pass over in silence the millennium\r\nthat intervenes between antiquity and modernity. There\r\nis a continuity in the history of the human intellect. Looking\r\nback on the hundreds of thousands of years during which\r\nman has inhabited the surface of this planet, we cannot\r\nfail to be struck by the fact that only during the last few\r\nthousand years have civilizations appeared. We must,\r\ntherefore, suppose that these civilizations developed with\r\nsome sort of dependence on each other, that, in fact, they\r\nare versions of one movement in the development of\r\nhumanity. To understand our own version of civilization\r\nwe must trace it back to its origin, and this we can do only\r\nthrough the Middle Ages. It is beside the point to urge\r\nthat the Middle Ages contributed little to the actual sum of\r\nknowledge of the external world. What we want to know\r\nis why they contributed so little, and how, contributing so\r\nlittle, they yet succeeded in passing on to our time the basic\r\nideas from which science has grown.\r\n\r\nThese Middle Ages, after all, were not a thousand years\r\nof cataclysm. They represent doubtless a deterioration of\r\nthe human mind, but the nature and causes of that deterioration\r\nare themselves the subject of intense scientific interest.\r\nThe Middle Ages can no more be disregarded in considering\r\nthe general course of science than can a degenerate\r\nor parasitic series of plants or animals be passed over when\r\nconsidering the larger group to which they belong and from\r\nwhich they have sprung. The very degeneracy of such a\r\nseries has an interest of its own, and may, by helping us to\r\nexclude accidental elements, enable us to detect essential\r\ntraits which we might otherwise overlook.\r\n\r\nWe begin our task with some attempt to delimit\r\nthe period with which we are concerned. Without\r\nattempting to define science, we may describe it as the\r\nprocess of making knowledge. Being a process it must also\r\ninvolve the idea of progress or at least of movement. The\r\nworld of science is a dynamic world with its own stores of",
  "p061.png": "ever-acting energy. The world of the mediaeval thinker,\r\non the other hand, was a static one, a world in which such\r\nforces as were acting were impressed from without. When\r\nand how was this static element introduced?\r\n\r\nWe may first consider the terminus a quo of the mediaeval\r\nattitude toward the external world. The Middle Ages\r\nbegin, for science, at that period when the ancients ceased\r\nto make knowledge. Now, ancient science can be traced\r\nclearly as an active process up to the end of the second\r\ncentury of the Christian era. Galen, one of the very\r\ngreatest and most creative biologists of all time, died A.D. 200.\r\nPtolemy, one of the greatest of the cosmographers, was his\r\nolder contemporary (p. 47). After Galen and Ptolemy,\r\nGreek science flags and scientific inspiration dwindles.\r\n\r\nMathematics holds out the longest, but with the mathematician\r\nTheon of Alexandria, who died about 400, we\r\npart altogether with the impulse of the science of antiquity.\r\nStoicism and Neoplatonism too, the chief systems of thought\r\nof the late Empire, are dying and are giving place to that\r\ngreat philosophical and religious movement, the repercussion\r\nof which is felt right through the Middle Ages and down\r\nto our own time. The standpoint of its great protagonists,\r\nTertullian (155-222), Lactantius (260-340), and, above all,\r\nSt. Jerome (340-420) and St. Augustine (354-430), is outside\r\nthe department with which we have here to deal, but\r\nit was assuredly not conducive to the exact study and record\r\nof phenomena. We may fix the end of Antiquity and the\r\nbeginning of the Middle Ages for science at the end of the\r\nfourth or the beginning of the fifth century [chart, p. 66].\r\n\r\nThe terminus ad quem of mediaeval science is, perhaps,\r\nless easy to determine. Mediaevalization, in our view,\r\nwas a slow process under the action of which the human\r\nmind, failing to increase the stock of phenomenal knowledge,\r\nsank slowly into an increasing ineptitude. At a certain\r\npoint the nadir of mental deterioration was reached and\r\nintellectual competence tended again upward. The time\r\nof lowest degradation of the human intellect varied according",
  "p062.png": "to the state of civilization in different parts of Europe. It\r\nwas probably most general about the tenth century. After\r\nthis may be discerned a slow ascent. Later, in the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries, we encounter considerable extension\r\nof natural knowledge. There is still, however, no\r\nwidespread acceptance of the ancient view that had been\r\nvoiced by the philosopher Seneca (3 B.C.-A.D. 65) that\r\nknowledge may be indefinitely extended (p. 57). That view\r\nappears to be an essential element in any effective doctrine\r\nof progress. In the scholastic period, however, there\r\ndo at last appear a very few forward-looking minds, such\r\nas that of Roger Bacon (1214-94), but they are as yet very\r\nrare and exceptional. When we reach the fifteenth century\r\nand the full influence of Humanism we encounter a larger\r\nnumber of forward-looking thinkers, but they are still\r\nisolated. Not until the sixteenth century is there any\r\neffort, at once organized and conscious, to translate into\r\naction this new-born hope in the future. It is only in the\r\nearly years of the seventeenth century that the hope obtains\r\nformal philosophical expression once more, with Francis\r\nBacon (1561-1626) and Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650). By\r\nthat time, however, not only are the Middle Ages past but\r\nthey are so much forgotten that the reading public needs\r\nskilled interpreters to explain the mediaeval point of view.\r\n\r\nIf we have to name a year for the end-point of mediaeval\r\nscience we would select 1543. In that year appeared two\r\nfundamental modern works based on the experimental\r\nmethod, the De fabrica corporis humani of the Belgian Andreas\r\nVesalius (1514-64) [Fig. 46] and the De revolutionibus orbium\r\ncaelestium of the Pole Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543)\r\n[Fig. 45]. It is true that for generations before 1543 there\r\nwas a dawning consciousness of the inadequacy of the\r\nmediaeval cosmic system. That discontent, however, was\r\nvague and ill-expressed, and of the nature rather of mental\r\ndiscomfort than of intellectual revolt. It is also true that for\r\nsome generations after the time of Vesalius and Copernicus\r\nthe characteristic doctrines of the science of the Middle",
  "p063.png": "Ages were almost universally taught in the schools. Such\r\ndoctrines, too, were still diffused by literature, and are, for\r\ninstance, displayed in the writings of Shakespeare. But\r\nthe ideas on which the works of Vesalius and Copernicus\r\nhad been based gain, from this time onward, an ever wider\r\nhearing. The year 1543 saw for the first time two published\r\nauthoritative works that formally rejected the old\r\nviews. These works, though produced by men who had\r\nsteeped themselves in the old system, yet provided a new\r\nstandpoint. For science, then, 1543 is the natural terminus\r\nad quem of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nNow, since the human mind turned on its upward course\r\nafter the tenth century, and since the process was accelerated\r\nduring the great scholastic period of the thirteenth century\r\nand again at the Revival of Learning of the fifteenth century,\r\nit may be asked why should we not choose one or other of\r\nthese dates as the end-point of the scientific Middle Ages?\r\nThe thirteenth century, the epoch of consolidation of\r\nCatholic philosophy, has been selected as one of exceptional\r\nenlightenment, and has been specially exalted by those\r\nwho lay great emphasis on the continuing r\u00f4le of the Church\r\nin the development of the intellectual system of our modern\r\nworld. There are, therefore, some who would place the\r\ndivision in the thirteenth rather than in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. There are yet others, biased perhaps by the\r\nliterary training of the classics, who would place the cleavage\r\nabout the year 1400. They would make the Revival of\r\nLearning, and especially of Greek letters, the basis of the\r\ndifferentiation between mediaeval and modern. There are\r\neven those who are so steeped in pessimism concerning our\r\nown time and have such a yearning for the 'Ages of Faith'\r\nthat they have found much to exalt in the spiritual life of\r\nthe earlier Middle Ages and little to appreciate in the\r\nrationalism of the thirteenth and later centuries.\r\n\r\nYet to make the great division at any such date as 1000,\r\n1200, or 1400 would be an error, because, with very few\r\nexceptions, the point of view of the eleventh-century",
  "p064.png": "encyclopaedist, of the thirteenth-century scholastic, and\r\nof the fifteenth-century scholar was formally and essentially\r\nan effort to return to the past. It was the literature and\r\nlanguage of antiquity, the antiquity of the fathers, of the\r\nphilosophers, or of the poets, that these men sought more or\r\nless vainly to revive.\r\n\r\nIn an encyclopaedia of the eleventh century nothing\r\ncan be found that is not derived from patristic sources.\r\n\r\nThe great Catholic scholastics of the thirteenth century\r\nbelieved that they were reconstructing the philosophy of\r\nAristotle. Few first-hand students of that great man of\r\nscience will now be found to agree with the interpretation\r\nsupplied by them. It is true that, despite the errors of\r\nphilosophical interpretation, scientific elements are not\r\nwholly wanting in scholastic writings. Yet in that age the\r\ninfinity of the knowable universe was passionately denied,\r\noriginality of view was furtively hidden under the cloak of\r\nauthority, and knowledge--so the knowers claimed--was\r\nalways based on the wisdom of antiquity.\r\n\r\nImitation rather than origination was the characteristic\r\nmental attitude also of the most enthusiastic scholars of the\r\nfifteenth century. The Revival of Learning, even the process\r\nby which the ancient texts were recovered, though it\r\nmay rightly be regarded as containing scientific elements,\r\nhad for its motive the imitation of the past by the present,\r\nrather than the modern archaeological aim of the mental\r\nreconstruction of the past with the object of understanding\r\nthe present. The ablest writers of the time sought to become\r\nthe 'apes of Cicero.' What is true of the literary\r\nstudies of the Renaissance is just as true of the scientific\r\nstudies of the period. The rescue of the Greek texts enormously\r\nenlarged the mental horizon, it is true, but it kept\r\nvision ever on one plane. It chained men's minds more\r\nclosely than ever to the past, though it was a newly discovered\r\npast.

His physiological theory, however, is still\r\nbased on Galen just as surely as the circular orbits ascribed\r\nby Copernicus to the planets are derived from Aristotle.\r\n\r\nWith Copernicus and Vesalius, however, organized and\r\nsystematic observation had found her place. Fabricius ab\r\nAquapendente (1537-1619) in Anatomy and Tycho Brahe\r\n(1546-1601) in Astronomy did but practise a method which\r\ntheir two great predecessors had formally initiated. But\r\nfor the process of free generalization on such observation\r\nand for the effective wielding of the new weapon of experiment\r\nthe world had still to wait for the generation of Galileo\r\n(1564-1642), Kepler (1571-1630), and Harvey (1576-1657).\r\n\r\n\u00a7 2.

  "p067.png": "by an event of the highest importance for the history of\r\nthe human intellect. Between the beginning of the tenth\r\nand the end of the twelfth century there was a remarkable\r\noutburst of intellectual activity in Western Islam. This\r\nmovement reacted with great effect on Latin Europe, and\r\nespecially on its views of nature, by means of works which\r\ngradually reached Christendom in translations from the\r\nArabic. In the light of this great intellectual event we may\r\ndivide our vast mediaeval period into three parts, an earlier\r\nDark Age, an intermediate Age of Arabian Infiltration, and\r\na later Scholastic Age. The Age of Arabian Infiltration may\r\nitself be conveniently subdivided into an earlier period of\r\nFirst Arabian Impact and a later one of Arabian Translation\r\n[Fig. 31]. During all these periods the general beliefs as\r\nto the nature of the external world hardly change, but the\r\ndifference in presentment of the material is such that the\r\nmediaevalist need seldom be in doubt into which category\r\nto place any document from these centuries treating of a\r\nscientific topic.\r\n\r\nThe task of the first mediaeval period was the conveyance\r\nof the remains of the ancient wisdom to later ages. During\r\nthe closing centuries of the classical decline, the literature\r\nthat was to be conveyed had been delimited and translated\r\ninto Latin, the only language common to the learned West.\r\nWe may briefly discuss this classical heritage.\r\n\r\nThe work of Plato that is least attractive and most obscure\r\nto the modern mind fitted in well with the prevalent views\r\nof the Neoplatonists. The commentary on the Timaeus,\r\nprepared by Chalcidius in the third century from a translation\r\nby Apuleius in the second, presents the basis of views\r\nheld throughout the entire Middle Ages on the nature of\r\nthe universe and of man. Thus the Timaeus became one\r\nof the most influential of all the works of antiquity, and\r\nespecially it carried the central dogma of mediaeval science,\r\nthe doctrine of the macrocosm and microcosm.\r\n\r\nOf Aristotle there probably survived only the Categories\r\nand the De interpretatione, translated in the sixth century by",
  "p068.png": "Boethius (480-524). A Greek introduction to the Categories\r\nhad been prepared by Porphyry in the second century,\r\nand this also was rendered into Latin by Boethius. Thus\r\nthe only Aristotelian writings known to the Dark Age of\r\nscience were the logical works, and these determined the\r\nmain extra-theological interest for many centuries. It is a\r\nworld-misfortune that Boethius did not see his way to prepare\r\nversions of those works of the Peripatetic school that\r\ndisplay powers of observation. Had a translation of Aristotle's\r\nHistoria animalium or De generatione animalium\r\nsurvived, or had a Latin version of the works of Theophrastus\r\non plants reached the earlier Middle Ages, the\r\nwhole mental history of the race might have been different.\r\nBoethius repaired the omission, to some small extent,\r\nby handing on certain mathematical treatises of his own\r\ncompilation, the De institutione arithmetica, the De institutione\r\nmusica, and the (doubtful) Geometrica. These works\r\npreserved throughout the darkest centuries some fragment\r\nof mathematical knowledge. Thanks to them we can at\r\nleast say that during the long degradation of the human\r\nintellect, mathematics, the science last to sink with the fall\r\nof the Greek intellect, was not dragged down quite so\r\nlow as the other departments of knowledge. The main\r\ngift of Boethius to the world, his De consolatione philosophiae,\r\nwhich preserved some classical taste and feeling, lies outside\r\nour field.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar service to that of Boethius was\r\nrendered by Macrobius (395-423) and by Martianus\r\nCapella (c. 500). The latter, especially in his Satyricon,\r\nprovided the Dark Age with a complete encyclopaedia.\r\nThe work is divided into nine books. The first two contain\r\nan allegory, in heavy and clumsy style, of the marriage\r\nof the god Mercury to the nymph Philology. Of the last\r\nseven books of the work, each contains an account of\r\none of the 'Liberal Arts,' grammar, dialectic, rhetoric,\r\ngeometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music, a classification\r\nof studies that dates back to Varro (116-27 B.C., p. 10) and",
  "p069.png": "was retained throughout the Middle Ages. The section on\r\nAstronomy has a passage containing a heliocentric view\r\nof the universe, a view that had been familiar to certain\r\nearlier Greek astronomers. The cosmology of Capella,\r\nlike that of Chalcidius, is Neoplatonic, as is also the work\r\nof Macrobius, whose commentary on the Somnium\r\nScipionis of Cicero gave rise to some of the most prevalent\r\ncosmological conceptions of the first mediaeval period.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the little cosmography, mathematics, and\r\nastronomy that could be gleaned from such writings as these,\r\nthe Dark Age inherited a group of scientific and medical\r\nworks from the period of classical decline. By far the most\r\nimportant was the Natural History of Pliny the elder\r\n(A.D. 23-79, p. 12), which deeply influenced the early\r\nencyclopaedists. Somewhat akin to it are the Quaestiones\r\nnaturales of the moralist Seneca (3 B.C.-A.D. 65, p. 14),\r\nwhose ethical attitude toward phenomena delighted many\r\nmediaeval writers by whom he was taken for a Christian.\r\n\r\nVery curious and characteristic is a group of later medical\r\npseudepigrapha bearing the names of Dioscorides, Hippocrates,\r\nand Apuleius. These extremely popular works were\r\nprobably all prepared or at least translated between the\r\nfourth and sixth centuries. They provided much of the\r\nmedical equipment of the Dark Age and reappear in the\r\nearly Anglo-Saxon vernacular literature (see page 141).\r\n\r\nSuch material, then, was the basis of the mediaeval\r\nscientific heritage. Traces of it are encountered in De\r\nInstitutionibus divinarum et humanarum literarum of Cassiodorus\r\n(490-585), perhaps the earliest general writer whose\r\nworks bear the authentic mediaeval stamp. The scientific\r\nheritage is, however, much more fully displayed in the\r\nOrigines of Isidore of Seville, a late sixth-century work\r\nwhich formed a cyclopaedia of all the sciences in the form\r\nof an explanation of the terms proper to each. For many\r\ncenturies Isidore was very widely read, and the series\r\nIsidore (560-636), Bede (673-735), Alcuin (735-804),\r\nRabanus Maurus (776-856), who borrow from one another",

The Age of Arabian Infiltration\r\n\r\nThe tenth century and those that follow bring us into\r\nrelation with the wisdom of the East. In these centuries\r\nthe relation of East and West with which we are nowadays\r\nfamiliar is reversed. In our time most Oriental peoples\r\nrecognize the value of Western culture, and give it the\r\nsincerest form of flattery. The Oriental recognizes that\r\nwith the Occident are science and learning, power and\r\norganization and public spirit. But the admitted superiority\r\nof the West does not extend to the sphere of religion.\r\nThe Oriental who nowadays gladly accepts the Occidental\r\nas his judge, his physician, or his teacher, wholly repudiates,\r\nand perhaps despises, his religion. In the Europe of the\r\ntenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries it was far other.\r\nThe Westerner knew full well that Islam held the learning\r\nand science of antiquity. His proficiency in arms and\r\nadministration had been more than sufficiently proved--the\r\nOccidental belief in them is enshrined in our Semitic\r\nwords 'arsenal' and 'admiral.' There was a longing, too,\r\nfor the intellectual treasures of the East, but the same fear\r\nand repugnance to its religion that the East now feels for\r\nWestern religion. And the Western experienced obstacles\r\nin obtaining the desired Oriental learning analogous to those\r\nnow encountered by the Eastern in the Occident.\r\n\r\nThe earliest definitely Oriental influence that we can\r\ndiscern as affecting ideas about nature is of the character\r\nof infiltration rather than direct translation. The first\r\nliterary agents of this process appear to have been mainly\r\nJews who had been under Saracen rule. Such influence\r\ncan be traced in two works in the Hebrew language by\r\nSabbatai ben Abraham ben Joel (913-82), better known\r\nas Donnolo, a Jew of Otranto who practised medicine at\r\nRossano in Southern Italy. Donnolo learnt Arabic while",

He\r\ntravelled in the Italian peninsula in search of learning,\r\nand must thus have spread some of his Arabic science.\r\nHis most important work, known as the Book of Creation,\r\nis dated to the year 946. It is a mystical treatise of great\r\nhistorical and philological interest and involves a knowledge\r\nof astrology. It unquestionably draws on Arabic sources,\r\nand sets forth fully the ancient doctrine encountered in the\r\nTimaeus of the macrocosm and microcosm or parallelism\r\nbetween the external world of nature and the internal world\r\nof man's body (see page 215). This idea was very popular\r\namong the Arabian writers.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Latin document exhibiting Oriental influence\r\nis a treatise on astrology to which the name 'Alchandrus'\r\n(Alexander?) is attached. This work has come down to\r\nus in a manuscript written about 950 probably in Southern\r\nFrance. The repeated use of Hebrew and Arabic equivalents\r\nfor the names of constellations and planets, and the\r\noccasional use of Hebrew script, leave no doubt that it also\r\nis of Jewish origin.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these works enables us to understand\r\nthe Oriental influence in the mathematical writings of the\r\nlearned Pope Silvester II (Gerbert, d. 1003), who spent some\r\nyears in Northern Spain, where Jews are known to have\r\nacted as intermediaries between Moslems and Christians.\r\nGerbert was, perhaps, among the earliest to introduce the\r\nso-called 'Arabic system'--really the Indian system--of\r\nnumbering, which slowly replaced the much clumsier\r\nRoman system, with its tiresome use of the abacus for\r\nsimple mathematical processes. He is also believed to have\r\ninstigated a translation from the Arabic of a work on the\r\nAstrolabe.\r\n\r\nHerman the Cripple (1013-54) spent his life at the\r\nBenedictine abbey of Reichenau in Switzerland. He wrote",
  "p073.png": "certain mathematical and astrological works which were\r\nextensively used in the following century. Herman was\r\n\r\nFig. 33.--Spheres of Religious Influence about 1150.\r\n\r\nunable to read Arabic, and could not travel by reason of his\r\ninfirmity. Yet his writings display much Oriental influence,\r\n\r\nFig. 34.--Spheres of Religious Influence about 1500.\r\n\r\nwhich was almost certainly conveyed to him by wandering\r\nscholars of the type of Donnolo and 'Alchandrus.' Similar\r\nthough somewhat belated evidence of the influence of what\r\nwe have called the process of Arabic infiltration is exhibited",
  "p074.png": "in the lapidary of Marbod of Anjou, Bishop of Rennes\r\n(1035-1123), and in the extremely widely read work on the\r\nmedicinal use of herbs, probably composed by Odo of\r\nMeune, Abbot of Beauprai (Macer Floridus, d. 1161).\r\n\r\nThe Arabic learning thus beginning to trickle through\r\nto the West in a much corrupted form was, however, by\r\nno means an entirely native Saracen product; it was derived\r\nultimately from Greek sources. There was, indeed, yet\r\none channel by which the original Greek wisdom might\r\nstill reach Europe. Communication between the West\r\nand the Byzantine East was very little in evidence in the\r\ncenturies with which we are now concerned, but a Greek\r\ntradition still lingered in certain Southern Italian centres,\r\nand especially in Sicily. South Italy and Sicily remained\r\nfor centuries under the nominal suzerainty of Byzantium,\r\nand the dialects of the 'many-tongued isle' bear traces to\r\nthis very day of the Greek spoken there and in Calabria and\r\nApulia, until late mediaeval times. But the Saracens had\r\nbegun their attacks on Sicily as early as the eighth century,\r\nand their rule did not cease until the Norman conquest of\r\nthe eleventh century. The Semitic language of the Saracens\r\nleft the same impress on the island as did their art and\r\narchitecture, so that between the tenth and thirteenth centuries\r\nSicily is a source of Greek and Arabic learning for\r\nWestern Europe.\r\n\r\nOne seat of learning in the Southern Italian area felt\r\nespecially early the influence of the Graeco-Arabic culture.\r\nSalerno, on the Gulf of Naples, had been a medical centre\r\nas far back as the ninth century (see p. 240). It is\r\nclear from surviving manuscripts that, even apart from the\r\nGreek language, some traces of ancient Greek medicine\r\nlingered in Latin translation widely diffused in Magna\r\nGraecia during the centuries that succeeded the downfall\r\nof the Western Empire. Such learning as remained was\r\ngalvanized into life by Saracenic energy and, with what we\r\nknow of the carrying agents of Arabic culture, it is easy\r\nto understand the tradition that attributes the founding of",
  "p075.png": "the great medical school of Salerno to the co-operation of a\r\nGreek, an Arab, a Latin, and a Jew (see p. 241). From the\r\nlatter part of the eleventh century Salernitan material is\r\nfull of Semitic words, a few of which, such as the anatomical\r\nterm 'nucha' and the names of some drugs, linger in medical\r\nnomenclature to this day.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 4. Translation from the Arabic\r\n\r\nA very important agent of the Arabic revival was Constantine\r\nthe African (d. 1087), a native of Carthage, who\r\ncame to Italy about the middle of the eleventh century.\r\nHe became a monk at Montecassino, and spent the rest\r\nof his life turning current Arabic medical and scientific\r\nworks into Latin. His sources are mainly Jewish writers of\r\nNorth African origin. In his desire for self-exultation\r\nConstantine often conceals the names of the authors from\r\nwhom he borrows, or he gives them inaccurately. His\r\nknowledge of both the languages which he was treating was\r\nfar from thorough and his translations are wretched. But\r\nthese versions were very influential, and they remained\r\ncurrent in the West long after they had been replaced by the\r\nbetter workmanship of Toledo students of the type of\r\nGerard of Cremona (1114-87). It is interesting to note\r\nthat one of Constantine's works is dedicated to Alphanus,\r\nArchbishop of Salerno (d. 1085), who was perhaps the\r\nfirst medical translator direct from the Greek.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Oriental influences that reached the West\r\nhad thus been brought by foreign agents or carriers, but\r\nthe desire for knowledge could not be satisfied thus. The\r\nmovement that was soon to give rise to the universities\r\nwas shaping itself, and the Western student was beginning\r\nto become more curious and more desirous of going to the\r\nwell-springs of Eastern wisdom.\r\n\r\nHis main difficulty was one of language. Arabic was the\r\nlanguage of Eastern science and letters, and its idiom was\r\nutterly different from the speech of the peoples of Europe.\r\nMoreover, its grammar had not yet been reduced to rule",
  "p076.png": "in any Latin work, nor could teachers be easily procured.\r\nEven in the thirteenth century we find that Roger Bacon,\r\nthough he clearly perceived the importance of linguistic\r\nstudy and eagerly sought to unlock the literature of foreign\r\ntongues, had still not found the key. He had only time to\r\ncommence laboriously the grammatical apparatus of the\r\nGreek and Hebrew languages. The only way to learn\r\nArabic was to go to an Arabic-speaking country. Yet this\r\n\r\nFig. 35.--Map to illustrate the recession of Islam in the Spanish\r\npeninsula. The figures after the names of the towns are the dates of their\r\nconquest by Christendom.\r\n\r\nwas a dangerous and difficult adventure, involving hardship,\r\nsecrecy, and perhaps abjuration of faith. Moreover, to\r\nlearn the language at all adequately for rendering scientific\r\ntreatises into Latin meant a stay of years, while the work\r\nof translation demanded also some understanding of the\r\nsubject-matter to be translated. There is good evidence\r\nthat an effective knowledge of this kind was very rarely\r\nattained by Westerns, and probably never until the later\r\ntwelfth century.\r\n\r\nAt the period during which Western science began to",
  "p077.png": "draw from Moslem sources there were only two areas of\r\ncontact of the two cultures: these were respectively Spain\r\nand 'the Sicilies.' The conditions in the two were somewhat\r\nsimilar. In the tenth century the Iberian peninsula\r\nwas Moslem save for the small kingdoms of the French\r\nmarch, Leon, Navarre, and Aragon. Here the grip of\r\n\r\nFig. 36.--Italy at the beginning of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nIslam had soon relaxed and this territory remained historically,\r\nreligiously, racially, and linguistically a part of\r\nthe Latin West.

In 1085 Alphonso\r\nVI of Leon (Alphonso I of Castille), aided by the Cid,\r\nconquered Toledo, and there most of the work of transmission\r\ntook place.",
  "p078.png": "\r\nThe schools of Southern Italy and Sicily were on the\r\nwhole less influential, though their work of translation\r\ncontinued to a somewhat later date. They are, however,\r\nimportant in another respect, for from them went forth\r\nthe first renderings of scientific works made direct from\r\nthe Greek. These translations of scientific works direct\r\nfrom the Greek began to appear as early as the eleventh\r\ncentury, when Alphanus, Archbishop of Salerno (d. 1085),\r\nproduced a Latin version of a work by Nemesius (fourth\r\ncentury). Such translations increased in number and\r\nimportance gradually and very slowly. A most interesting\r\nworker in Sicily was Burgundio of Pisa (d. 1194), who\r\nmade translations both from the Arabic and the Greek.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the process of translation from Arabic,\r\nespecially in Spain, was frequently carried on by the intervention\r\nof Jewish students, and many of the translated\r\nworks were themselves by Jews. The tenth, eleventh, and\r\ntwelfth centuries, a time of low degradation of the Latin\r\nintellect, was the best period of Jewish learning in Spain.\r\nArabic was the natural linguistic medium of these learned\r\nJews. Among them were the Egyptian physician Isaac\r\nIsraeli ben Solomon (d. c. 1000), called in the West Isaac\r\nJudaeus, Solomon ibn Gabirol (1021-58?) of Saragossa,\r\nwho was disguised in scholastic writings as Avicebron,\r\nand Moses ben Maimon (1135-1204) of Cordova, more\r\nfamiliarly known as Maimonides. These three authors\r\nwere among the more important and influential that were\r\nrendered into Latin from Arabic during the Middle Ages,\r\nand their works form part of the Eastern heritage won by\r\nthe translators during these centuries. All three deeply\r\ninfluenced Western scholasticism.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries,\r\nwhen the tide had turned and Islam was in retreat, it was\r\noccasionally possible for a scholar with a gift for languages,\r\nsuch as Gerard of Cremona (1114-87), to find a skilled\r\nnative Christian teacher. But in the tenth or eleventh\r\ncentury Christian learning and Christian society in Spain",
  "p079.png": "were subject and depressed. Like many modern peoples\r\nsimilarly placed, these native Christians were attached with\r\nthe more fanaticism to the religion which held them together\r\nand to the language of their Church. The student of an\r\nearlier time could find no effective Christian teacher of\r\nliterary Arabic, while the very sciences which he sought\r\nto acquire were suspect as the mark of the infidel and the\r\noppressor.\r\n\r\nIt thus comes about that there is some obscurity--much\r\nof it doubtless intentional--as to the circumstances\r\nunder which the best translations from the Arabic were\r\nmade. It is apparent, however, that these earlier versions\r\nwere sometimes prepared by a group of three or more\r\nwho would interpret one to the other. One would turn\r\nthe Arabic text, sentence by sentence, into the vernacular\r\nor into Hebrew, another would then render it into Latin,\r\nand perhaps a third would turn it into literary form.\r\nNaturally, in this process many words would be encountered\r\nthat could not be rendered either into the vernacular or\r\ninto the barbarous Latin of the time. Especial difficulty\r\nwould be encountered with technical terms. The meaning\r\nof some of these might well be imperfectly known to the\r\ntranslators themselves. Such words were therefore often\r\nsimply carried over, transliterated, in their Arabic or\r\nHebrew form, and the early versions are full of Semitic\r\nexpressions. The Latin mediaeval astronomical and mathematical\r\nvocabularies especially abound in these Semitic\r\nwords, many of which, such as 'azure,' 'zero,' 'zenith,'\r\n'cipher,' 'azimuth,' 'algebra,' 'nadir,' and names of stars, as\r\n'Aldebaran' and 'Altair,' are still in use. Most of the Latin\r\nmedical literature of the Middle Ages was also of Arabian\r\norigin and contained a whole host of Semitic words which,\r\nhowever, were almost all displaced by equivalents of Greek\r\norigin during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe sort of translation which emerged from the process\r\nthat we have described may well be imagined. When\r\nit is also remembered that to reach the Arabic from the",
  "p080.png": "original Greek the text had sometimes already passed\r\nthrough similar stages with Syriac or Hebrew as intermediaries,\r\nit will be understood that the first scientific books\r\nthat reached the West were often but travesties of the\r\nGreek originals from which they were ultimately derived.\r\n\r\nMen who may be supposed to have worked in such a\r\nway as we have pictured are Adelard of Bath (c. 1100),\r\nwho journeyed both to Spain and to Sicily, and published\r\na compendium of Arabic science, and the wizard Michael\r\nScot (1175?-1234?), who visited the court of Frederick II\r\nat Naples and produced versions or abridgements of the\r\nbiological works of Aristotle. Such men, like Gerbert\r\nbefore them and Peter of Abano after them, were frequently\r\naccused of magical practices. More scientific in their\r\nmethods and probably better equipped linguistically were\r\nRobert of Chester (c. 1144), who rendered the Koran into\r\nLatin and translated the valuable arithmetic of Al Khowarizmi\r\n(fl. 830) as well as works on alchemy and astronomy,\r\nand Alfred the Englishman (c. 1180), who translated from\r\nArabic a corrupted work of the Aristotelian school on\r\nplants that would otherwise be lost. Robert and Alfred\r\nworked in Spain.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest and most typical of all the translators\r\nfrom the Arabic was Gerard of Cremona (1114-87),\r\nwho spent many years at Toledo and obtained a thorough\r\nknowledge of Arabic from a native Christian teacher.\r\nHe is credited with having translated into Latin no less than\r\nninety-two complete Arabic works. Many of them are\r\nof very great length, among them being the Almagest of\r\nPtolemy, on which Regiomontanus (p. 101) began his work\r\nin the fifteenth century, and the enormous Canon of\r\nAvicenna (980-1037), perhaps the most widely read medical\r\ntreatise ever penned, editions of which continued to be\r\nissued right down to the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\nThe Canon of Avicenna is still in current use in the East.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Gerard of Cremona, and perhaps\r\nstimulated by him, were certain native translators. One",
  "p081.png": "of these was Domenico Gonzalez (Gundissalinus, fl. 1140),\r\na Christian who rendered into Latin the Physica and the\r\nDe caelo et mundo of Aristotle. Another Spaniard, Johannes\r\nHispalensis or Ibn Daud, known to the Latins as Avendeath\r\n(fl. 1130-55), was a converted Jew. Avendeath translated,\r\namong many other works, the pseudo-Aristotelian\r\ntreatise Secretum secretorum philosophorum which greatly\r\ninfluenced Roger Bacon, as well as the astronomical works\r\nof the Baghdad Jewish writer Messahalah (Ma scha'a\r\nAllah = 'What God will,' 770-820). This Latin translation\r\nof Messahalah long formed the staple popular account\r\nof the system of the world under the name of the Englishman\r\nJohn Holywood ('Sacrobosco,' d. 1256). Gonzalez\r\nand Avendeath, like Gerard, worked at Toledo.\r\n\r\nThe Sicilian group was less active. The Optics of\r\nPtolemy was translated about 1150 by the Sicilian admiral\r\nEugenius of Palermo. He rendered it from the Arabic,\r\nthough he had an effective knowledge of Greek. The great\r\nastronomical and mathematical system of Ptolemy known\r\nto the Middle Ages as the Almagest was also first translated\r\ninto Latin from the Arabic in Sicily in 1163 (some twelve\r\nyears before it was rendered by Gerard at Toledo), and\r\nArabian versions only of the work were available until the\r\nfifteenth century. The last important translator of Sicilian\r\norigin, the Jew Farragut (Farradj ben Selim, Moses Farachi,\r\nd. 1285), was a student at Salerno, and his works were\r\namong the latest of any influence that issued from that\r\nancient seat of learning. Such later translators were, however,\r\nusually less influential, and at the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury we may say that the period of important translations\r\nwas rapidly closing.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 5.

It differed rather in degree\r\nthan in kind from that of the earlier Dark Age and from that\r\nof the age of Arabian infiltration. The systems differed",
  "p082.png": "in the extent to which certain logical conclusions from the\r\npremises provided were pushed, and in the amount of which\r\neach was influenced by certain theological conceptions.\r\n\r\nIn the late classical age there had developed the Stoic\r\nsystem of thought, which divided with Neoplatonism and\r\nEpicureanism all the more philosophical minds of the\r\nancient world. This Stoic philosophy assumed that man's\r\nfate was determined by an interplay of forces, the nature\r\nand character of which were, in theory at least, completely\r\nknowable. The microcosm, man, reflected the macrocosm,\r\nthe great world, that lay around him. But how and to what\r\nextent did the one reflect the other? In seeking to determine\r\nthese points Stoicism, like Neoplatonism and the other\r\nphilosophical systems of the classical twilight, gleaned, from\r\nmany sources, material which it passed on in a corrupted\r\nstate to the Latin West. In a somewhat less imperfect\r\nform such material lingered for centuries in the Byzantine\r\nEast, until, with the great outburst of Islam, it was caught\r\nup and elaborated by the Arabic culture. Thus elaborated,\r\nit was sent forth a second time to Latin Europe by the process\r\nof infiltration and translation.\r\n\r\nThe astrological conceptions of the Stoics and of the\r\nlater Christian ages had drawn both on Plato and on Aristotle.\r\nThe hylozoism of the Timaeus, the doctrine that\r\nthe universe itself and the matter of which it is composed is\r\nliving, gave a suggestive outline to the hypothesis of the\r\nparallelism of the outer and inner universe. But the main\r\ndetails, on which the hypothesis was based, were drawn\r\nfrom Aristotle, whose views or supposed views as to the\r\nstructure of the universe formed the framework on which\r\nthe whole of mediaeval science from the thirteenth century\r\nonward was built. Especially Aristotle's conception of the\r\nstars as living things, of a nature higher and nobler than that\r\nof any substance or being in the spheres below, was a\r\npoint of departure from which the influence of the heavenly\r\nbodies over human destinies might be developed.

Taking its clue\r\nfrom the Aristotelian conception of the 'perfection' of the\r\ncircle among geometrical figures, it distinguished the perfect,\r\nregular, circular motion of the fixed stars from the imperfect,\r\nirregular, linear motion of the planets. The fixed\r\nstars, moving regularly in a circle, controlled the ordered\r\ncourse of nature, the events that proceeded in recurring,\r\nmanifest, and unalterable rounds, such as winter and\r\nsummer, night and day, growth and decay. The planets, on\r\nthe other hand, erratic or at least errant in their movements,\r\ngoverned the more variable and less easily ascertainable\r\nevents in the world around and within us, the happenings\r\nthat make life the uncertain, hopeful, dangerous, happy\r\nthing it is. It was to the ascertainment of the factors\r\ngoverning this kaleidoscope of life that astrology set itself.\r\nThe general outline was fixed, death in the end was sure,\r\nand, to the believing Christian, life after it. But there was\r\na great uncertain zone between the sure and the unsure that\r\nmight be predicted and perhaps avoided, or, if not avoided,\r\nits worst consequences abated. It was to this process of\r\ninsurance that the astrologer set himself, and his task remained\r\nthe same throughout the Middle Ages. In this\r\nhope, savoir afin de pr\u00e9voir, the mediaeval astrologer was\r\nat one with the modern scientist.

In the view of many patristic\r\nwriters the study of the stars was likely to lead to indifference\r\nto Him that sitteth above the heavens. This is\r\nthe general attitude of the fourth and fifth centuries, set\r\nforth for instance by Augustine, who speaks of 'those\r\nimpostors the mathematicians (i.e. astrologers) ... who\r\nuse no sacrifice, nor pray to any spirit for their divinations,\r\nwhich arts Christian and true piety consistently rejects and\r\ncondemns.'\r\n\r\nBy the sixth and seventh centuries, however, the Church\r\nhad come to some sort of terms with astrology, and Isidore\r\nregards it as, in part at least, a legitimate science. He\r\ndistinguishes, however, between natural and superstitious\r\nastrology. The latter is 'the science practised by the\r\nmathematici who read prophecies in the heavens, and place\r\nthe twelve constellations [of the Zodiac] as rulers over the\r\nmembers of man's body and soul, and predict the nativities\r\nand dispositions of men by the courses of the stars.'

Each zodiacal sign was held to govern\r\nor to have special influence on some region of the body,\r\nand each of the planets was held to influence a special\r\norgan. The supposed relations of zodiacal signs, planets,\r\nand bodily parts and organs, together with their power to\r\nproduce disease, had been set forth in such late Latin\r\nwriters as Firmicus Maternus (c. 330) and Avienus (c. 380)\r\nand in innumerable Greek texts. This belief, conveyed\r\nto the Dark Age, but much corrupted and attenuated during\r\nits course, was brought back again to the West, reinforced\r\nand developed, in translations from the Arabic during the\r\nscholastic period which followed [Figs. 30, 38, 42].\r\n\r\n\u00a7 6. Scholasticism and Science\r\n\r\nDoctrine of this type received into Europe was stamped\r\nwith the special form of Western thought. Now, it was\r\ncharacteristic of the mediaeval Western thinker that, like\r\nthe early Greek thinker, he sought always a complete\r\nscheme of things. He was not content to separate, as we\r\ndo, one department of knowledge or one class of phenomena,\r\nand consider it in and by itself. Still less would he have\r\nheld it a virtue to become a specialist, to limit his outlook to\r\none department with the object of increasing the sum of\r\nknowledge in it, and in it alone.\r\n\r\nHis universe, it must be remembered, so far as it was\r\nmaterial, was limited. The outer limit was the primum\r\nmobile, the outermost of the concentric spheres of which\r\nthe Aristotelian world was composed. Of the structure\r\nand nature of all within the sphere of the primum mobile\r\nhe had been provided with a definite scheme. The self-appointed\r\ntask of mediaeval science was to elaborate that\r\nscheme in connexion with the moral world.

These schemes took into account the\r\nform of the world and of man as derived from Arabian\r\nsources, and read into each relationship a spiritual meaning.\r\nFor such an attitude of mind there could be no ultimate\r\ndistinction between physical events, moral truths, and\r\nspiritual experiences. In their fusion of the internal and\r\nexternal universe these mystics have much in common with\r\nthe mystics of all ages.

During the thirteenth\r\ncentury these two orders provided most of the great university\r\nteachers, who occupied themselves in marshalling the\r\nnew knowledge and making it more accessible. Alexander\r\nof Hales (d. 1245) and Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) were\r\nFranciscans, Albertus Magnus (1206-80) and St. Thomas\r\nAquinas (1227-74) were Dominicans.\r\n\r\nA foremost influence in the revival was the recovery\r\nof the writings of Aristotle. It was the interpretation of\r\nthese works by a few great thinkers that gave to Scholasticism\r\nits essential character. Thus it is that the history\r\nof the recovery of the Aristotelian corpus has been a main\r\ntheme of writers on mediaeval thought for over a century.\r\nThe first scholastic to be acquainted with the whole works\r\nof Aristotle was Alexander of Hales. Albert was the first\r\nwho reduced the whole philosophy of Aristotle to systematic\r\norder with constant reference to the Arabian commentators,\r\nwhile Aquinas remodelled the Aristotelian philosophy in\r\naccordance with the requirements of ecclesiastical doctrine.\r\nAs time went one, the works of Aristotle, at first represented\r\nin translations from Arabic, became partially accessible\r\nin renderings direct from the Greek. A very important\r\nagent in this process was the Dominican William of Moerbeke\r\n(d. 1286). Those whose interests direct their attention\r\nto the Revival of Learning associated with Humanism\r\nare apt to forget, however, that texts of these translations\r\nfrom the Greek were excessively rare till the sixteenth\r\ncentury despite the advent of printing. Moreover they\r\nremained far from common till the seventeenth century,\r\nand the staple education of all but a few universities was\r\nstill based on versions from the Arabic as late as the time of\r\nFrancis Bacon, Galileo and Descartes and even beyond.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the process of codifying the new\r\nknowledge derived from the Arabic, involving as it did a\r\nrapid development in the whole mental life, did not early",

The test of\r\nsuch faith, so far as nature is concerned, must be the direct\r\nappeal to nature. Yet there is very little evidence of direct\r\nobservation of nature in the great physical encyclopaedias\r\nof the thirteenth century, such as those of the Augustinian\r\nAlexander of Neckam (1157-1217), the Dominican Vincent\r\nde Beauvais (1190-1264), or the Franciscan Bartholomew of\r\nEngland (c. 1260). The fact is that the mediaeval mind was\r\nobsessed with the idea of the world as mortal, destructible,\r\nfinite, and therefore completely knowable both in space and\r\nin time. Thus the motive for detailed research, in our\r\nmodern sense of the word, was hardly present. One great\r\nIslamic philosopher there was, Averroes (Ibn Roschd, d.\r\n1198), who took an opposite view. His works were available\r\nin Latin, but the great ecclesiastics set their face against\r\nhim, though he was widely and illicitly read. Moreover\r\nhis theories were adopted by Jews and Latins with\r\nheretical leanings, tacit or expressed.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval world thus knew nothing of that infinite\r\nsea of experience on which the man of science nowadays\r\nlaunches his bark in adventurous exploration. The task\r\nof the writers of these encyclopaedias was rather to give a\r\ngeneral outline of knowledge, to set forth such a survey\r\nof the universe as would be in accord with spiritual truth.\r\nThe framework on which this encyclopaedic scheme was\r\nbuilt was Aristotle, largely as conveyed by his Arabic\r\ncommentator Averroes, the philosopher whom the heads\r\nof the Church had condemned. Yet it is an amusing\r\nreflection on the incompleteness of all philosophical systems\r\nthat Albert (1206-80), who perhaps more than any\r\nman was responsible for the scholastic world-system,\r\nwas among the very few mediaeval writers who were real\r\nobservers of nature. It is, after all, in the very essence of\r\nthe human animal to love the world around it and to watch\r\nits creatures.

The Dawn of Modern Science. Roger Bacon\r\n\r\nThus the best of the systematizers among the schoolmen\r\nwere leading on to the direct observation of nature. Contemporary\r\nwith Albert (1206-80) and Aquinas (1227-74)\r\nwere several remarkable scholastic writers who form the\r\nearliest group with whom the conscious advancement of\r\nknowledge was a permanent interest. These men were the\r\nfirst consciously forward-looking scientific thinkers since\r\nthe fourth century. Perhaps the most arresting of them\r\nwas Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175-1253), Bishop of Lincoln.\r\nGrosseteste determined the main direction of physical\r\ninvestigation in the thirteenth century by his work on Optics.\r\nHe knows something of the action of mirrors and of the\r\nnature of lenses. It would appear that he had actually\r\nexperimented with lenses, and many of the optical ideas of\r\nRoger Bacon were taken straight from his master. The\r\nmain Arabian source of Grosseteste was a Latin translation\r\nof the mathematical work of Alhazen of Basra (965-1038).\r\nAnother important optical writer whom Alhazen deeply\r\ninfluenced was the Pole Witelo (fl. 1270), an acute mathematical\r\ninvestigator who worked in northern Italy. Roger\r\nBacon was largely dependent on Witelo.\r\n\r\nThe opposition between the followers of Dominic and of\r\nFrancis was paralleled by certain very remarkable developments\r\namong the Franciscans themselves. There is no\r\nstranger and more impressive chapter in the whole history\r\nof thought than that of the early history of the Franciscans.\r\nWithin the memory of men who had known the saintly\r\nfounder of the order (1181-1226), the 'penitents of Assisi,'\r\nthe 'friars minor,' sworn as 'jongleurs of God' to bring\r\nChrist cheerfully to the humblest and the meanest, sworn",
  "p091.png": "to possess nothing, to earn their bread from day to day by\r\nthe work of their own hands or at need by begging, forbidden\r\nto lay by store or to accumulate capital, this order\r\nof humble servants of Christ had produced a series of\r\nmonumental and scholarly intellects. These men not\r\nonly initiated what bid fair to be a renaissance of science\r\nand letters, but also aided in the formation of the bulwark\r\nwhich long resisted the very movement that thus emanated\r\nfrom the order itself. To both parties the English Franciscan\r\nhouses contributed an overwhelming share. To\r\nthe former, or scientific party, as we may call it, belonged\r\nRobert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln (c. 1175-1253), John\r\nPecham, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1292), the elusive\r\nAdam Marsh (d. 1257), and above all Roger Bacon (1214-94).\r\nTo the latter or theological party are attached the\r\nnames of Alexander of Hales (d. 1245), Duns Scotus\r\n(1265?-1308?), and William of Ockham (d. 1349).\r\n\r\nThe primary inspirer of the scientific movement was\r\nthe great Bishop of Lincoln himself, as we learn from his\r\npupil Roger. 'Nobody,' says Bacon, 'can attain to proficiency\r\nin the science of mathematics by the method\r\nhitherto known unless he devotes to its study thirty or\r\nforty years ... and that is the reason why so few study\r\nthat science.... Yet there were found some famous men,\r\nas Robert [Grosseteste] Bishop of Lincoln, and Adam Marsh,\r\nand some others, who knew how by the power of mathematics\r\nto unfold the causes of all things and to give a sufficient\r\nexplanation of human and divine phenomena. The\r\nassurance of this fact is to be found in the writings of those\r\ngreat men, as, for instance, in their works on the impression\r\n[of the elements], on the rainbow and the comets, on the\r\nsphere, and on other questions appertaining both to theology\r\nand to natural philosophy.' The work of this remarkable\r\ngroup of Franciscans at Oxford extended beyond the sciences\r\nto language and literature. There was thus the beginning\r\nof a real renaissance of Greek letters which died an early\r\ndeath. After Roger Bacon's death the scientific revival",
  "p092.png": "also languished until recalled to life by a second revival\r\nof a later century.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient to give a summary of the scientific\r\nachievements of Roger Bacon, the greatest of the Franciscan\r\ngroup and the first man of science in the modern\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n1. He attempted to set forth a system of natural knowledge.\r\nThis system was far in advance of his time, and its\r\nbasis was observation and experiment. He was clearly\r\nthe first man in modern Europe of whom this can\r\nbe said.\r\n\r\n2. He was the first to see the need for the accurate study\r\nof foreign and ancient languages. He attempted grammars\r\nof Greek and Hebrew along definite scientific lines. He\r\nalso projected a grammar of Arabic. Moreover, he laid\r\ndown those lines of textual criticism which have only been\r\ndeveloped within the last century.\r\n\r\n3. He not only discussed the nature of the experimental\r\nmethod, but was himself an experimenter. His writings\r\nare important for the development of the following sciences:\r\n\r\n(a) Optics. His work on this subject was a textbook\r\nfor the next two centuries. He saw the importance of\r\nlenses and concave mirrors, and showed a grasp of the\r\nmathematical principles of optics. He described a system\r\nequivalent to a two-lens apparatus, and there is trustworthy\r\nevidence that he actually used a compound system of lenses\r\nequivalent to a telescope.\r\n\r\n(b) Astronomy was Bacon's perpetual interest. He spent\r\nthe best part of twenty years in the construction of astronomical\r\ntables. His letter to the Pope in favour of the\r\ncorrection of the calendar, though unsuccessful in his\r\nown day, was borrowed and reborrowed, and finally, at\r\nthird-hand, produced the Gregorian correction.\r\n\r\n(c) Geography. He was the first systematic geographer\r\nof the Middle Ages. He gave a systematic description of\r\nEurope, Asia, and part of Africa. He collected first-hand\r\nevidence from travellers in all these continents. His",
  "p093.png": "arguments as to the size and sphericity of the earth were\r\namong those that influenced Columbus.\r\n\r\n(d) Mechanical Science. Suggestions by him include\r\nthe automatic propulsion of vehicles and vessels. He\r\nrecords a plan for a flying machine.\r\n\r\n(e) Chemistry. The chemical knowledge of his time was\r\nsystematized in his tracts. His description of the composition\r\nand manufacture of gunpowder is the earliest that has\r\nreached us. It is clear that he had worked out for himself\r\nsome of the chemistry of the subject.\r\n\r\n(f) Mathematics. His insistence on the supreme value\r\nof mathematics as a foundation for education recalls the\r\nattitude of Plato. It was an insistence that the method\r\nof thought was at least as important as its content.\r\n\r\nSummed up, his legacy to thought may be regarded as\r\naccuracy of method, criticism of authority, and reliance on\r\nexperiment--the pillars of modern science.\r\n\r\nBacon was not an isolated phenomenon, but an important\r\nlink in the chain of scientific development. But during the\r\ncentury after Bacon, though his mathematical and philosophical\r\nworks were still studied in the schools, the greatest\r\nadvances were to be found among the physicians. Of\r\nmedical men the last half of the thirteenth and the first\r\nhalf of the fourteenth century exhibit an especially brilliant\r\ngroup. Bologna had possessed a medical school since the\r\ntwelfth century, and had inherited the learning of Salerno.\r\nAt Bologna had worked Hugh of Lucca (d. 1252?) and\r\nhis son or pupil Theodoric (1206-98). Here surgery\r\nmay be said to have been born again with the practice of\r\nRoland of Parma (c. 1250), the successor and faithful follower\r\nof Roger of Salerno (c. 1220). At Bologna, above all,\r\nWilliam of Saliceto (1215-80), backed by the authority of\r\nThaddeus of Florence (1223-1303), established a practical\r\nmethod of anatomization which was inherited by Mondino\r\nda Luzzi (1276-1328), whose work based on translations\r\nfrom the Arabic text of Avicenna became the general\r\nanatomical textbook of the later Middle Ages. By the",

  "p095.png": "of the most remarkable personalities of mediaeval medicine,\r\ntaught there. Arnald was not only one of the earliest\r\nexponents of the Hippocratic method of observing and\r\ncarefully recording symptoms of actual cases of disease,\r\nbut he also deeply influenced alchemy. That study was\r\neffectively of Arabian origin so far as the western world is\r\nconcerned. It begins in 1144 with the translation into\r\nLatin from Arabic by Robert of Chester of the De compositione\r\nalchemiae which Morienus Romanus, a contemporary\r\nhermit of Jerusalem, had 'edited for Kalid, king of\r\nthe Egyptians.' Alchemy had taken its rise with a real\r\neffort to understand the properties of metals, prompted by\r\nthe hope of transmuting the baser into the more precious.\r\nLike other mediaeval studies, it became linked with astrology,\r\nand the 'seven metals' were each of them controlled or\r\ninfluenced by the 'seven planets' much in the same way as\r\nwere the organs of the human body. Of such ideas Arnald\r\nwas a prolific exponent. He had direct access to both\r\nArabic and Hebrew. A student at Naples and Salerno,\r\na traveller in Italy, Sicily, France, and Spain, he served as\r\nmedical adviser to the Papal Curia both at Rome and Avignon\r\nand was employed as ambassador on more than one special\r\nmission. Arnald influenced politics no less than learning\r\nand ended his adventurous life at sea. A character very\r\ndifferent from Arnald was the Majorcan Raymond Lull\r\n(1235-1313), who was also learned in oriental languages.\r\nThe numerous alchemical works bearing Lull's name are,\r\nhowever, falsely ascribed to him. Lull was a visionary who\r\nperished as he desired, in his attempt to convert the Mohammedan\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 8. Humanism\r\n\r\nIn outlook no less remarkable than Arnald was the\r\nheretical Peter of Abano (1250-c. 1318). He earned a\r\nreputation as a magician, and his natural death saved him\r\nfrom the hands of the Inquisition. His body is said to\r\nhave been exhumed and burned. Peter--who was a most",
  "p096.png": "voluminous writer--had a knowledge of Greek, acquired at\r\nConstantinople, and he translated works from that language.\r\nHe was a professor at the University of Paris and later\r\nat Padua in the generation which followed that in which\r\nthe newly won Aristotelian works on physics had entered\r\nthe curriculum. His greatest and best-known work, the\r\nConciliator, expresses his mediation between the now\r\ncommencing humanistic Greek school and the Arabists,\r\nthough it appears that he had no knowledge of the Arabic\r\nlanguage. From the Conciliator we may learn that he had\r\ncome into contact with the great traveller Marco Polo\r\n(c. 1254-1324). Among the views of Peter of Abano that\r\nare most worth record may be mentioned his statements\r\nthat the air has weight, that the brain is the source of\r\nthe nerves and the heart of the vessels--all ideas that\r\nwere novel in his time. He made a remarkably accurate\r\nmeasure of the length of the year as 365 days 6 hours\r\n4 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the fourteenth century, perhaps\r\nowing to social disturbance and notably to the effects of\r\nthe Black Death (1347-9), shows a distinct falling off\r\nin the intellectual advance. In medicine the most noteworthy\r\nname is that of Guy de Chauliac of Montpellier\r\n(1300-70), the most influential of all the mediaeval\r\nsurgeons. Outside the ranks of the physicians the most\r\nstriking figure in fourteenth-century science is probably the\r\nFrench Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson (1288-1344).\r\nHis work on astronomy was important as illustrating the\r\nconsciousness of a growing discontent with the Ptolemaic\r\nsystem of the universe.\r\n\r\nWith the fourteenth century appeared, too, a great movement\r\nthe hand of which is still heavy on our own day.\r\nHumanism was born. Historians have perhaps linked the\r\nhumanistic movement too intimately with a knowledge of\r\nthe Greek language. Instances of knowledge of that\r\nlanguage in the West can, however, be adduced far back\r\ninto the Dark Ages (e.g. John Scot Erigena, c. 850), while",
  "p097.png": "many of the greatest of the humanists, including Petrarch\r\nhimself (1304-74), were without such knowledge. It is\r\nworth noting too, as linking humanism with the Middle\r\nAges, that Petrarch's epistolary style was still moulded on\r\nSt. Augustine rather than on Cicero.\r\n\r\nThe backward-looking habit, strong in man from his\r\nnature and strengthened by the teaching of the Christian\r\nreligion, was yet further enforced by the humanists. From\r\nPetrarch onward they were ever brooding on the past that\r\nhad been Greece and Rome. Yet even from the first, the\r\nhumanists had the sensation too of being builders, so that\r\ntheir glance was at times turned away from the past and\r\ntowards what was to come, nay, what was in the act of\r\nbecoming. Roger Bacon and a few isolated souls had had\r\nthis double vision, but for a whole school to possess it was\r\nsomething new. In his Book of memorable things Petrarch\r\nsays outright, 'Here stand I as though on a frontier that\r\ndivides two peoples, looking both to the past and to the\r\nfuture.' While studying the classics some of these very\r\nmen were indeed visibly forging new intellectual weapons,\r\nthose national vernaculars that have made modern literature\r\nand thought possible. It is no mere coincidence that\r\nBoccaccio (1313-75), friend and contemporary of Petrarch,\r\nshould have been at once the first modern literary man to\r\nstudy Greek and the first great master of Italian prose.\r\n\r\nWe must note, however, that save for reference for the\r\none supreme poet in their own tongue, Dante (1265-1321),\r\nthe backward gaze of the Italian humanist is always fixed\r\non the more distant classical past, not on the nearer period\r\nthat came to be regarded as a yawning chasm, an abyss across\r\nwhich he sought to reach back to the thought of antiquity.\r\nTo him the Middle Ages seemed real enough and dark\r\nenough. It stood for the period during which the sweet\r\nGreek literature had been ignored. Even in this new age\r\nit could be understood by few except in Latin dress, and the\r\nwork of translation remained somewhat of a specialist's\r\noccupation. To the end of the fifteenth century an effective",
  "p098.png": "knowledge of Greek continued to be a rarity even among\r\nscholars, and we may point to some of the most important\r\nteachers of the sixteenth century who were still without it.\r\n\r\nThe great influence of the masterpieces of Greece, therefore,\r\nwas then as now something indirect, often conveyed\r\nthrough translators and special interpreters, something\r\nesoteric, the full beauty of which was shared only by a\r\nfew adepts, a subtle thing that influenced men's way of\r\nthinking rather than the actual content of their minds.\r\nThe mere capacity for translation from the Greek goes back,\r\nas we have seen, to the eleventh century, the ninth century,\r\nor even beyond. It can therefore hardly have been simply\r\nthe discovery of the actual Greek language which brought\r\nabout the revival of letters. But if the knowledge of Greek\r\ngoes back so far, can we speak of a real Renaissance at all?\r\nHow can we account for the change of heart that came over\r\nthe world when humanism was born? Or is that change\r\nof heart but an illusion, a difference of degree rather\r\nthan of kind in a world where everything is in a state of\r\nbecoming?\r\n\r\nSome answer to this absorbing question we may glean\r\nby comparing the earlier Greek works which came to the\r\nWest to those of later advent. The general character of\r\nthe earlier translations was determined by the outlook of\r\na world becoming ever more deeply Arabicized. Islam,\r\nthe inheritor of antiquity, entered into the enjoyment of\r\nits legacy with great spirit, but with a taste already fixed.\r\nThe literary and artistic works were debarred by a definite\r\ntheological standpoint. Homer and Hesiod, Sophocles\r\nand Euripides, Greek Art and Greek Architecture were\r\nchapters as closed and forbidden to Islam as to early\r\nChristian Europe. It was the philosophical, the scientific,\r\nthe mathematical, the medical works that made an appeal.\r\nThese gave an illusory impression of completeness to life\r\nwith which Islam long rested content. It was these very\r\nworks that were the first to be rendered into Latin from\r\nthe Arabic, and the Latin taste being thus determined it",
  "p099.png": "was similar works that were the first to be turned into\r\nLatin direct from the Greek.\r\n\r\nSuch material--and it is bulky and intricate enough--represents\r\nthe Western access to Greek wisdom before the\r\nfourteenth century. It does not lack variety, but it lacks\r\nlife. They err who think the discovery of the humanists\r\nwas the Greek language--here the humanists were but\r\nfollowers where others had been pioneers. It is something\r\nmuch deeper and more fundamental which they have handed\r\non to us, something the nature of which they hardly knew\r\nand the meaning of which they missed--which perhaps\r\nthey still miss--in their enthusiasm. The humanists discovered\r\nthe literary works of antiquity. In them they\r\nbecame absorbed to the exclusion of all else. The\r\nhumanist eagerness passed into a literary vogue, and long\r\ncast the blight of a purely literary education on the\r\nmodern world. The barren striving after form as distinct\r\nfrom substance, the miserable and slavish imitativeness\r\nthat is no flattery but an insult to its model, these features\r\nexhibited typically in the literature of the late Empire, were\r\nrepeated by the humanists as they have been often repeated\r\nin modern times and as they still remain a curse to the\r\nso-called 'classical education.'\r\n\r\nThe humanist then did not give us the knowledge of a\r\nlanguage nor did he even give an insight into the life of\r\nantiquity. What the humanist really gave was a something\r\nwhich, added to the heritage already there, made possible\r\na completer reconstruction of the Greek spirit. That reconstruction,\r\nindeed, he was himself never able to make; it\r\nwas the succeeding generations that made it for themselves.\r\nWith that reconstruction Greece lived again, the modern\r\nworld was ushered in, and modern science, art, literature,\r\nand philosophy were born. It is an illuminating reflection\r\nand one not without bearing on our present state that\r\nboth the mediaeval heritage of Greek science and the\r\nRenaissance heritage of Greek literature proved barren by\r\nthemselves. It was not until the one fertilized the other",
  "p100.png": "that there was real and vital growth. Modern thought,\r\nmodern science, modern art, and modern letters are the\r\noffspring of that union. Let us put from our minds the\r\ntime-worn fallacy that they are the parthenogenetically\r\nproduced offspring of one of these elements alone.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 9. The Science of the Renaissance\r\n\r\nThe humanists as a class did not exhibit great sympathy\r\nwith the scientific outlook. Their interests were literary\r\nand their peculiar aversion was the Arabist tendency of\r\nthe Middle Ages that they were leaving behind. That\r\nArabist tendency was very largely expressed in the ancient\r\nscientific and philosophical themes, some of which we have\r\ndiscussed in outline. In the movement initiated by Roger\r\nBacon in the thirteenth century a new element had been\r\nintroduced. That movement had fallen into the background\r\nafter Roger's death. It had not entirely died, but it had\r\nbecome 'quietist'--if the expression may be used in this\r\nconnexion--a part of the seldom expressed faith of a small\r\nband of philosophically-minded recluses. Faith in the\r\nappeal to nature was at last to find more open expression.\r\nWith the fifteenth century, discontent with the entire\r\nmediaeval scientific scheme becomes more generally obvious,\r\nand we perceive a first hint of the idea that it may be\r\npossible to adjust theory by means of experiment.\r\n\r\nThe earliest suggestion is made by a man of high genius\r\nand scholarship, the Rhinelander Nicholas of Cues (1401-64),\r\nwho became a cardinal and made a fruitless attempt\r\nto reform the calendar. A groping towards a philosophical\r\nbasis for the experimental method is exhibited in his book\r\nDe docta ignorantia, which has nothing to do with the\r\nabsurdity of erudition, as its name might be thought to\r\nimply, but concerns itself with acknowledged ignorance,\r\ni.e. with the inability of the human mind to conceive the\r\ninfinite. The theoretical views of Nicholas led him to a\r\nbelief that the earth is moving, though he attained to no\r\ngenuine heliocentric theory. He records a careful experi-*",
  "p101.png": "*ment of a growing plant--afterward pirated by the seventeenth-century\r\nwriter van Helmont (1577-1644)--proving\r\nthat it absorbs something of weight from the air. This is\r\nthe first biological experiment of modern times, and incidentally\r\nthe first formal proof that the air has weight. In\r\nanother work, De staticis experimentis, Nicholas shows that\r\nhe knew how to apply the experimental method in detail,\r\nand he suggests in outline many investigations which were\r\nnot taken in hand until the time of Galileo 150 years later.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of the combination of scholarship and observation\r\nthat Nicholas had started was carried on by several\r\nastronomers in the second half of the fifteenth century.\r\nFor part of this work we are indebted to the far-sightedness\r\nof another cardinal, Johannes Bessarion (1389-1472), a\r\nGreek by birth, who was equally anxious to aid the progress\r\nof astronomical knowledge and to diffuse Greek literature\r\nin the West. Bessarion's friendship, extended to the two\r\nGerman astronomers Purbach and Regiomontanus, made\r\npossible their work which formed the foundation of that of\r\nCopernicus.\r\n\r\nGeorge Purbach (1423-61) followed with great avidity\r\nthe study of Ptolemy. He died prematurely and had only\r\ntranslations from the Arabic on which to base his work.\r\nHe improved on his original, however, by calculating a table\r\nfor every 10 minutes, using sines instead of chords.\r\n\r\nJohannes M\u00fcller (1436-76) of K\u00f6nigsberg (= King's\r\nmountain), usually known from his birthplace as Regiomontanus,\r\nthough his life was hardly longer than that of\r\nPurbach, had the good fortune to work on Greek originals.\r\nHe produced the first systematic treatise on trigonometry\r\nand a table of sines for every minute and of tangents for\r\nevery degree. He edited too the Epitome of Ptolemy which\r\nPurbach had left behind him in an imperfect state. He\r\ndied at Rome, whither he had been summoned by the Pope\r\nto aid in the long contemplated reform of the Calendar.\r\nThe important works of Regiomontanus were only published\r\nafter his death [Fig. 42]. His name has become associated",

The marvellous rapidity of his insight,\r\nthe sureness of his intuitions, and his extreme versatility\r\nmade earlier students place Leonardo in an isolated and\r\nalmost non-human position. His very limitations, moreover,\r\nwhile they have increased the apparent gulf which\r\nseparates him from other men, have hampered us in our\r\ncomprehension of his mind. Isolated he remains by the\r\nloftiness of his genius, but more prolonged study has\r\nrevealed many of the sources of his knowledge and some of\r\nhis methods of work.\r\n\r\nTo understand anything of Leonardo's scientific work\r\nand of its fate we must however recognize his defects.\r\nLeonardo's great limitation was on the literary and linguistic\r\nside. He had no gift for language and did not acquire even\r\nan elementary knowledge of Latin till well on in life. He\r\nhad no power of literary expression. The language that\r\nhe employs is that of a Florentine shopkeeper of the\r\nlower class. He created no great phrase or saying. In\r\nhis notebooks his sentences are usually ungrammatical\r\nand often unfinished. Even allowing for the purely private\r\nnature of these memoranda, it is yet fairly evident that in a\r\nliterary sense he was incoherent. The very rush of his\r\nideas seems to have obstructed the natural channels of their\r\nexpression. Of him his biographer Vasari quotes with\r\nadmirable point the lines of Petrarch:\r\n\r\nE l'amor di saper che m'ha si acceso\r\nChe l'opera e retardato dal desio.\r\n\r\nMy love of knowledge so inflamed me\r\nThat my work was retarded by my very desire.\r\n\r\nWith what we now know of Leonardo the question may\r\nreasonably be raised whether his art did, in fact, consume\r\nthe major part of his energy and his thoughts. Among\r\nthe great artists he was notorious for the smallness of his",
  "p104.png": "output and for the extreme slowness with which he worked.\r\nOn the other hand, he left behind him a vast mass of papers,\r\nabout 5,000 leaves of which have survived. These contain\r\nevidence not only of a unique scientific insight but of a\r\ntireless industry which is almost incredible. He covers\r\nthe whole field of science from mathematics to physiology,\r\nand there is nothing that he touches which he does not\r\nilluminate. To give but a few scattered instances: he\r\npresents us not only with a model of a flying machine but\r\nwith an invention of a helicopter, and he analyses the nature\r\nof the flight of birds in a way that has only been surpassed\r\nduring the last few years; he has a design for a parabolic\r\ncompass on a principle that was not adopted till late in the\r\nseventeenth century [Fig. 41]; he hints at a heliocentric\r\nview of the world; he has admirable drawings of quick-firing\r\nand breech-loading guns; he was an ingenious\r\ninventor of engineering apparatus [Fig. 44]; he has\r\nmastered the theoretical principles of perspective; he sets\r\nforth the homologies of the vertebrate skeleton; he has\r\npassages which suggest the laws of motion; and his\r\nanatomical and embryological standpoint was not passed\r\nin certain respects for hundreds of years [Fig. 43].\r\n\r\nLeonardo may be linked with his time by tracing some\r\nof his scientific ideas back to his predecessors. The break\r\nin continuity is much more marked if we seek to trace them\r\nforwards. He had indeed very little influence on the science\r\nof the age which immediately followed him. Save in\r\ncertain ideas and drawings of a few sixteenth-century anatomists\r\nleading on to Vesalius, the scientific work of Leonardo\r\nwas without effect until modern times. If Leonardo be\r\nregarded as the topmost peak of the Renaissance, that\r\npeak, continuous with a long range of mighty mountains\r\non one side, terminates in an almost sheer precipice on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBefore we quite part with the Renaissance we must\r\nconsider another remarkable character whose life-course\r\nwas almost as isolated and aberrant as that of Leonardo.",

  "p105.png": "The Swiss writer Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombastus\r\nvon Hohenheim, commonly known as Paracelsus\r\n(1493-1541), was a person of violent, dramatic, and repellent\r\ntemper, a born rebel whose iconoclasm doubtless did something\r\nto deter men from the worship of the old idols. His\r\nsymbolic act of burning the works both of the Greek Galen\r\nand of the Arab Avicenna, as an introduction to his lecture\r\ncourse at Basel, typified the position of the independent\r\ninvestigators of the generation that immediately followed\r\nhim. A writer of excessive obscurity, an obscurity of language,\r\nof form, and of thought, very few have claimed the\r\nprivilege of penetrating to his full meaning, and those few\r\nhave nearly all been infected with some of the defect of\r\nexpression from which the master suffered. There is,\r\nhowever, a general agreement among the learned and\r\nnebulous band of Paracelsists that their hero did indeed\r\nforeshadow the 'new instauration.' His aim was to see\r\nthe world in the 'Light of Nature.' That light of his\r\nis dimmed for us because of his extreme gullibility in some\r\nmatters, his violence and self-contradiction in others, and\r\nthe involved and mystical presentment in all. 'Nature'\r\ncontained for him the influence of the stars upon the lives\r\nof men and many other mysterious phenomena then\r\ngenerally credited. He believed still in a relation of microcosm\r\nand macrocosm--as in a residual sense we all do--but\r\nhis free modification of that theory paved the way for\r\nits rejection in the generation which followed.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 10.

  "p106.png": "knowing included the method of \"teaching to know.\"' Of\r\nthe reformers of the method of teaching to know, two stand\r\nat the very threshold of the new era, Nicholas Copernicus\r\nand Andreas Vesalius.\r\n\r\nThe Pole, Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543), despite the\r\nvast change that was introduced in his name into men's\r\nideas, was himself more in the line of such comparatively\r\nconservative scholars as Nicholas of Cues and Regiomontanus\r\nthan the more revolutionary Leonardo or Paracelsus.\r\nNo man was ever more 'academic,' and he continued\r\nto attend university courses until over thirty years of\r\nage. He studied at several Italian universities, giving attention\r\nto classics, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, law,\r\nand theology. His skill in painting suggests that he had\r\nthat type of visualizing imagination frequently associated\r\nwith scientific power.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was not, however, a first-hand observer on\r\nany large scale. He had, it is true, taken a number of\r\nobservations of eclipses and oppositions of planets, but for\r\nthe most part his results were obtained in the study. He\r\ntells us that he was induced to seek a new theory of the\r\nheavenly bodies by finding that mathematicians differed\r\namong themselves on this subject. He had counted up\r\nthe various motions of the heavenly bodies involved in the\r\nold system and concluded that some essential factor had\r\nbeen missed. He therefore turned to antiquity and learned\r\nfrom Cicero--who quotes Hiketas--and Plutarch that some\r\namong the ancients were of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n'Occasioned by this,' he says, 'I decided to try whether, on the assumption\r\nof some motion of the earth, better explanations of the revolutions\r\nof the heavenly spheres might not be found. Thus assuming the motions\r\nwhich I attribute to the earth ... I have found that when the motions\r\nof the other planets are referred to the circulation of the earth and are\r\ncomputed for the revolution of each star, not only do the phenomena\r\nnecessarily follow therefrom, but that also the order and magnitude of\r\nthe stars and of all their orbits and the heaven itself are so connected\r\nthat in no part can anything be transposed without confusion to the rest\r\nand to the whole universe.'",
  "p107.png": "\r\nIn this new scheme the ancient theory of the uniform\r\ncircular motion of the heavenly bodies was still retained.\r\nSince it involved the retention of the theory of epicycles\r\nas well as the displacement of the sun from the true centre\r\nof the planetary orbs, the simplicity of the scheme was only\r\napparent and comparative [Fig. 45].\r\n\r\nVesalius (1514-64) was in almost every respect a contrast\r\nto Copernicus. Young, ardent, and combative, his\r\n\r\nFig. 45.--Diagram by Copernicus to show his heliocentric system. The planets,\r\nEarth among them, circle round the sun.

The\r\ncontents of that great work were delivered in the form of\r\nlecture-demonstrations to crowded audiences. It contains\r\nan enormous number of first-hand observations which must\r\nhave been accumulated while working under the most\r\nextreme pressure. Vigorous and fearless in the demonstration\r\nof observed fact, Vesalius becomes more timid and",
  "p108.png": "less effective in the discussion of theory, and he leaves the\r\nGalenic physiology practically intact. He was a man of the\r\nlaboratory and lecture-room rather than of the study [Fig.\r\n46], and reflection was not the source of his power. Yet\r\neven his observations are by no means completely free from\r\ntraditional bias. Thus some of the poses of the figures and\r\nthe treatment of the skeletons in his book have been shown\r\nto be derived from scholastic sources, and there are anatomical\r\nstructures figured by him which are to be found in\r\nthe mediaeval tradition, but not in the human body. There\r\nare important points which he may have derived by tradition\r\nfrom Leonardo and the artist-anatomist of the previous\r\ngeneration. Taken as a whole, his work is, however, one\r\nof the most marvellous efforts of scientific observation that\r\nhas ever been launched upon the world. It is, moreover,\r\nthe earliest important work of observational science in\r\nmodern times [Fig. 46].\r\n\r\nA word must be said as to the point of view of Vesalius.\r\nNowadays the student's dissection-manual figures for\r\nhim the anatomy of the dead. Vesalius working in Italy\r\nin the sixteenth century was in the midst of a country of\r\nartists. He thinks always of the living body and seeks to\r\nrestore the anatomy of the part into its form when living.\r\nThe dramatic poses of his corpses and the landscape with\r\nwhich each is provided is no piece of idle artistry. It is a\r\npart of his scheme. Nor does he think so much of the actual\r\nbody he is dissecting as of the idea towards which God is\r\ntending in us all. Each body is, as it were, one of that\r\nsupreme artist's 'studies' for an ideal and final work of\r\nart. It is the anatomist's duty to attain as near as he can\r\nto that ideal.\r\n\r\nThe work of Vesalius was carried farther by a number\r\nof investigators in the latter part of the sixteenth century,\r\nbut by none with greater skill and intensity than Hieronymus\r\nFabricius ab Aquapendente (1537-1619), a successor\r\nof Vesalius in the Chair at Padua, where he taught for\r\nover sixty years and where William Harvey (1578-1657)",
  "p109.png": "was his pupil. Fabricius was one of the most successful\r\nand stimulating of medical teachers, and he added an\r\nenormous number of facts to the sum of anatomical and\r\nphysiological knowledge. As an investigator, however,\r\nhe lacked, like all his contemporaries, complete speculative\r\nfreedom. For that the time was still hardly ripe, and his\r\nphysiology was still largely Galenic. While he provided\r\nmany of the observations on which the view of the circulation\r\nof the blood was built, his vision remained obscured\r\nby the traditional outlook. It was left to his great English\r\npupil to enunciate the basic doctrine of modern physiology\r\nin the next century. The grasp of Galen was weakening,\r\nbut it had not yet wholly relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe mentality of Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), the greatest\r\nastronomer of the second half of the sixteenth century, was\r\nnot dissimilar to that of Fabricius, its greatest anatomist.\r\nTycho, like Fabricius, was a first-class observer, but,\r\nlike him, weak and timid in drawing conclusions. By means\r\nof newly designed but simple apparatus employed with\r\nexquisite skill, Tycho attained an unprecedented degree of\r\naccuracy in astronomical observation. His records were\r\nemployed later by his colleague Johann Kepler (1571-1630).\r\nThese observations aided Kepler to purge the Copernican\r\nhypothesis of the traditional notions concerning the movements\r\nof the heavenly bodies in circles. The circles were\r\nreplaced by ellipses and modern astronomy was born.\r\n\r\nThe year 1600 is associated with two important events\r\nin the history of science, which mark it out as the final parting\r\nof the ways. In that year Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), a\r\nprofound student of the works of Nicholas of Cues and an\r\nardent follower of Copernicus, suffered martyrdom at the\r\nstake. In that year William Gilbert (1540-1603) produced\r\nhis work On the magnet, on magnetic bodies, and on the earth\r\nas a great magnet, a new physiography,[1] demonstrated by many\r\narguments and experiments. The work is the first great\r\n\r\n1 The word he uses is physiologia, which is best translated by our word\r\nphysiography.",

Gilbert\r\naccepts fully the Copernican view of a heliocentric world,\r\nand he speculates fearlessly on observed conclusions. Above\r\nall, as the title of the work tells, his views are demonstrated\r\nby arguments and experiments. It is a distinction of which\r\nhe never loses sight, and he is careful to record exactly\r\nand by a special device his own personal experiences. These\r\nare clearly separated from his arguments and from the\r\nexperiences of others. The book has the form and spirit\r\nof a modern scientific treatise.\r\n\r\nWe have now left utterly behind the Middle Ages and\r\nall their works and ways. The old hypothesis of the\r\nmacrocosm and microcosm was no longer possible to those\r\nwho had studied and understood the works of Copernicus\r\nand Vesalius. Men no longer studied macrocosm and\r\nmicrocosm as such, but they became physicists or physiologists,\r\ntaking each of them a separated portion of the universe\r\nfor special study. This disposition to base opinion on\r\nobservation, involving separation of nature into departments,\r\ncharacterizes the modern method and distinguishes\r\nit from the mediaeval.

In\r\nIreland a special lorical value was attached to the prayers of\r\nSt. Patrick; thus in an early Irish poem in praise of him\r\nwe read that 'a hymn which thou hast chosen in thy lifetime\r\nshall be a lorica of protection to all.'\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all the loricae is indeed that which\r\nclaims to have been written by St. Patrick himself. Whether\r\nthe claim is just or no, the composition is certainly very\r\nancient and perhaps dates back to the fifth or sixth century,\r\nsince it was written in a period when paganism had still\r\nconsiderable influence. The 'Lorica of St. Patrick,' the\r\nf\u00e1eth fiada or 'cry of the deer' as it is called,[1] betrays its\r\nearly origin by the call for protection 'against incantations\r\nof false prophets; against black laws of paganism ...\r\nagainst deceit of idolatry and against spells of women,\r\nsmiths and druids.' In the first lines of this text we read\r\nhow 'Patrick made this hymn ... for the protection of\r\nhimself and his monks against the enemies that lay in ambush\r\nfor the clerics. And it is a lorica of faith for the protection\r\nof body and soul against demons and men and vices. When\r\nany person shall recite it daily with pious meditation on\r\nGod, demons shall not dare to face him, it shall be a protection\r\nto him against all poison and envy, it shall be a guard\r\nto him against sudden death; it shall be a lorica for his\r\nsoul after his decease.' The Lorica which bears the name\r\nof Gillus or Gildas, which we here discuss, is of a somewhat\r\nsimilar type and designed for a like purpose to that of\r\nPatrick, which it closely resembles in tone and style.\r\n\r\n1 Bernard and Atkinson, loc. cit., i. p. 133, and ii, p. 49. The interpretation\r\nof the term f\u00e1eth fiada is disputed. Some would read it feth\r\nfiada and consider that it was a spell peculiar to Druids and poets who\r\nby pronouncing certain verses of the hymn could make themselves invisible.\r\nThe point is one that only Celtic scholars can decide. See Hugh Williams,\r\nGildae de excidio Britanniae (Hon. Soc. of Cymmrodorion), 2 vols., London,\r\n1899, ii, p. 292.",
  "p115.png": "\r\nThe earliest copy of the Gildan Lorica that can be dated\r\nwith any accuracy is a Cambridge manuscript of Anglo-Saxon\r\nworkmanship. This manuscript has been recognized\r\non palaeographical grounds as a product of the ninth century,\r\nwhile its date can be more narrowly determined by its\r\nacrostic containing the name Aedeluald Episcopus.[1] This\r\nAedeluald or Aethelwald was Bishop of Lichfield between\r\n818 and 830. But the composition of the Lorica is anterior\r\nto the earlier of these dates, since it is clearly Celtic in origin\r\nand character, and there was no direct Celtic influence on\r\nthe liturgy of the English Church during the ninth century.\r\nThe Welsh frontier had been flung back across the Severn\r\nfifty miles and more from the seat of his bishopric well-nigh\r\ntwo centuries before Aethelwald occupied it, so that by the\r\neighth century Mercia was politically cut off from Wales.\r\nTo separative political elements must be added the odium\r\nresulting from the schismatic character of the British Church\r\nafter the Council of Whitby (664), reflected even in the\r\nwritings of so gentle a soul as Bede (672-735). Thus to\r\nexplain the Celtic source of the Lorica and to reach a\r\npoint when a Mercian would have adopted a prayer of\r\nBritish origin, we must certainly look further back than\r\nthe days of Aethelwald, and at least to the seventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, external literary evidence that the\r\ncomposition of the Lorica was anterior to the eighth century.\r\nAldhelm of Malmesbury (died 709) appears to have known\r\nof it, and his peculiar expression tuta pelta protegente is a\r\nreminiscence of stanza 16.[2] Further, all the MSS., except\r\nthat at Vienna, associate the Lorica with one Laidcend,\r\nLoding, or Lodgen. The Leabhar Breac or Speckled Book,\r\na work of the fourteenth century, speaks of the prayer as\r\nintroduced into Ireland by Laidcend, son of Baeth the\r\nVictorious. This Laidcend, according to the Irish annals,\r\n\r\n1 The entire document is printed by A. B. Kuypers, The Book of Cerne,\r\nCambridge, 1902.\r\n\r\n2 F. J. H. Jenkinson, The Hisperica Famina, Cambridge, 1908, p. xxii.",
  "p116.png": "died in 661, and if the Laidcend of the Leabhar Breac is\r\nthe same as Lodgen or Loding the prayer must be earlier\r\nthan this date.\r\n\r\nThe opening sentence of the Leabhar Breac tells us that\r\n'Gillus composed this Lorica to expel the demons who\r\nbeset him.' It has been suggested that this Gillus is identical\r\nwith Gildas the 'British Jeremiah.' Gildas Badonicus, the\r\nearliest British historian, was born in 516, the year of the\r\nbattle of Mount Badon, and died about 570. Gillus or\r\nGillas is known to be a common form of Gildas, especially\r\nin Irish documents. His well-known history, De excidio\r\nBritanniae, was written about 560, and a date about the\r\nmiddle of the sixth century must be ascribed to the Lorica\r\nif it is from his hand. The evidence that the work is by\r\nthis Gildas is however by no means conclusive. It may\r\nwell be that it dates from the century in which he lived, to\r\nwhich period other specimens of Hibernian Latin have been\r\nattributed,[1] though it is probable that most of them are at\r\nleast a century later. If Gildas Badonicus were really\r\nthe author we could regard the mortalitas huius anni, referred\r\nto in the text, as the yellow plague, which is said to have\r\nravaged Britain about 547, at which date the composition\r\nof the Lorica would then be approximately fixed.[2] A\r\nmore likely date for our document is perhaps about 600,\r\nand it is probably the work of a British Gildas other than\r\nhe of Badon.\r\n\r\n1 The view that the Lorica is of the sixth century, and the work of\r\nGildas, is upheld by H. Zimmer, Nennius Vindicatus, Berlin, 1893. It\r\nis regarded as of the seventh century (circ. 660) by R. Thurneysen in Zeit.\r\nf. deutsch Philologie, xxviii. p. 111, and by Hugh Williams, Gildas, London,\r\n1889-1901, p. 295, and Christianity in Early Britain, Oxford, 1912. There\r\nis general consent that it is not later than the seventh century.\r\n\r\n2 The dates of this plague lie between 543 and 548. The occurrence\r\nof this plague is doubted by C. Creighton, A History of Epidemics in Britain,\r\nCambridge, 1912, 2 vols., i. p. 4. It is thought that the story may have\r\narisen as a rumour of the great plague at Byzantium and elsewhere in\r\n543 and subsequent years. Cf. O'Donovan, Annals of the Four Masters,\r\nDublin, 1851, i. p. 183.",
  "p117.png": "\r\n\u00a7 2. Language.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Lorica of Gildas has attracted a great\r\ndeal of attention. The difficulty presented by mediaeval\r\nLatin is usually in the vocabulary, and is seldom constructional.\r\nTo this rule the Lorica is no exception, for, with a\r\nvery simple structure, it presents a most extraordinary\r\ncollection of out-of-the-way and exotic words. The language\r\nof the Lorica has been much studied in connexion\r\nwith the Hisperica Famina, a curious document of the seventh\r\ncentury in the Vienna Library, which the Lorica in many\r\nways resembles.[1]\r\n\r\nA similar specimen of the so-called 'Hibernian' or\r\n'Hisperic' Latin is encountered in a hymn attributed to\r\nSt. Columba (died 597), known from its opening words\r\nas Altus prosator.[2] The earliest manuscript of this composition\r\nis of the eleventh century, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat it was composed at a far earlier date.\r\n\r\nThe Altus prosator also, we are assured, renders the\r\nreciter thereof secure from all manner of spiritual destruction,\r\nand further 'protects against every death save death on the\r\npillow.'\r\n\r\nAnother early fragment of Celtic origin, the 'Leyden\r\n\r\n1 The text of the Hisperica Famina is accessible in Migne's Patrologia\r\nLatina, xc, p. 1186.

The Leyden Lorica is,\r\non the whole, however, much simpler and less interesting\r\nthan is the Gildan document.[1]\r\n\r\nModern research shows that the earlier stages of the\r\nprocess by which the Anglo-Saxon replaced the British\r\ntribes was one of infiltration and penetration rather than\r\nof invasion, conquest, and extermination, although doubtless\r\nboth elements were present. On this view we should\r\nexpect to find connecting links between the Anglo-Saxon\r\nand the Celtic languages, yet such links are extraordinarily\r\ndifficult to trace, and the classical Anglo-Saxon tongue--early\r\nliterary English--contains even fewer Celtic words\r\nthan does modern English. Such Celtic remains as are\r\nto be discovered in Anglo-Saxon documents must be\r\nsought either in Hisperic texts and their glosses or in\r\nother magical formulae. To find any real connexion between\r\nthe two languages, if any such ever existed, we\r\nshould probably need to look much further back than the\r\nformed literary English of which the best examples are of\r\nthe tenth century, beyond the Danish devastation of the\r\nninth century, beyond the racial bitterness of the eighth,\r\nbeyond the schism of the seventh century, perhaps even\r\nbeyond the Roman missionary effort of the sixth century\r\nunder Augustine of Canterbury. Documentary material\r\nof this order is, however, wholly lacking.\r\n\r\nNow although the race and language movement was\r\nalways westward, yet the cultural advantage for centuries\r\nwas, as is well known, on the side of the receding peoples.\r\nThe Celtic and English idioms are so vastly different that\r\nthen, as now, little mixture of the two can have taken place,\r\nbut there was a cultural diffusion in an eastward direction\r\nwhich is traceable in written documents. A small amount\r\nof Celtic magic and folklore spread among men of English\r\n\r\n1 V. H. Friedel, 'La Lorica de Leyde,' in the Zeit. f. celtische Philologie,\r\n1898, ii. p. 64.",

Of this\r\ninfluence the 'Leechdoms' give evidence in several places.\r\nTo the Anglo-Saxon clerics, who shared a knowledge of\r\nLatin with their Celtic colleagues, there was, however, an\r\neasy and natural means of communication, and of this\r\ninterchange the Lorica of Gildas is a very early monument.\r\nIt is written in that very characteristic form of Latin,\r\nknown as 'Hisperic' or 'Hibernian,' that was affected in\r\nsouth-west Britain and Ireland in the sixth and seventh\r\ncenturies. Considerable remnants of what must have been\r\nan extensive Hisperic literature have now been recovered.[1]\r\nIn this surviving Hisperic literature the Lorica of Gildas\r\nstands almost alone in that, while thoroughly Celtic in\r\ntone and style, and in use moreover by both the Irish\r\nand Welsh, it was yet popular with the English. This\r\ncurious fact is sufficiently proved by the existence of\r\nthree copies of the Lorica of Anglo-Saxon workmanship,\r\ntwo of them fully glossed in the Anglo-Saxon language.\r\nThe Gildan Lorica is thus perhaps the earliest surviving\r\nliterary link between the two rival cultures and rival\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nThat the Lorica of Gildas was not the only specimen of\r\nHisperic Latin that had reached the Saxon monasteries we\r\nlearn from the occurrence of difficult words from other\r\nHisperic documents in Anglo-Saxon vocabularies from the\r\neighth to the eleventh centuries, and occasionally in the\r\nwritings of Aldhelm (died 709). Through the medium of\r\nthese glosses and vocabularies the combined efforts of\r\nmediaevalists, and Greek, Semitic, Celtic, and Anglo-Saxon\r\nscholars have now extracted the meaning and source of a\r\ngreat number of these obscure terms.

There still remains,\r\nhowever, a small group which appear to be truly of Semitic\r\norigin, and cannot be otherwise explained. Prominent\r\namong these are iduma = [lote] = hands; gibrae = [lote] =\r\nman; and senas = [lote] = tooth. While the source of such\r\nwords cannot yet be fully explained, there are certain\r\npoints in connexion with this peculiar Semitic relationship\r\nthat may be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n(a) From an early date interest in the works of Jerome\r\nattracted attention to the words of Hebrew origin used by\r\nhim, and information as to the meaning of these and,\r\nperhaps, of other Hebrew words thus reached these shores.\r\nTwo very early vocabularies of Anglo-Saxon origin contain\r\na considerable proportion of Hebrew words.[3] Bede had a\r\nvestigial knowledge of Hebrew.\r\n\r\n1 These are to be found in vol. i. p. 386 and pp. 388-90; vol. ii.\r\np. 112 and pp. 348-50; vol. iii. p. 26, p. 78, pp. 288-90, and p. 294 of\r\nO.

Cockayne's suggestion for [lote] = eyes, giving the full guttural\r\nsound to the [lote], seems very strained. That conas means eyes seems\r\nclear from the fact that E is glossed oculos and D Anglo-Saxon\r\negan = eyes. Conas is glossed oculos in another tenth-century\r\nMS. (Wright, vol. i).\r\n\r\nPattham is shown by Irish gloss to E to mean forehead. For a source\r\nof the word the commentators are driven to Syriac.

Bathma is perhaps from\r\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af = steps, a word which there is evidence from Hesychius\r\nLexicographus (probably fifth century) was used as an out-of-the-way\r\nterm for thighs as \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af \u1f34\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 = thighs, legs, feet.\r\n\r\nExugiam glossed meaninglessly by A as Anglo-Saxon midirnan and by\r\nD as Anglo-Saxon micgernu. Micge is the usual Anglo-Saxon for\r\nurine and micgernu the place of the urine, i.e. the bladder. To regard\r\nit as equal to kidneys, as some have done, is to attribute to the author\r\nof the Lorica a physiological conception that he probably did not\r\npossess. For him it is probable that the kidneys would have been\r\nthe seat of some mental rather than urinary function. The Irish\r\ngloss gives tarb gliasta no fath\u00f3in, i.e. the bull (i.e. the thick part as\r\nopposed to the calf, the thin part) of the thigh, i.e. the rump or\r\nunder-rump. In W\u00fclcker the word exigia is glossed Anglo-Saxon\r\ngescinco which is surely a collective of sceanca = shank. The agreement\r\nof Anglo-Saxon and Irish glosses in this and other places indicates\r\na definite harmony of interpretation that can only have been\r\nreached by direct intercourse.\r\n\r\nIdumas glossed by A as Anglo-Saxon hondas = hands, and by\r\nE manus. The word itself is probably from [lote] = hands.\r\n\r\nStanza 21. Timpus is the usual mediaeval form of tempus.\r\n\r\nStanza 23.

Aelfric\r\nvocabulary Tauco (? for Tauto), hringban dh\u00e6s eagen = ring-bone\r\nof the eye.",

The material is neither edifying nor attractive, while\r\nthe discipline demanded of one who would investigate it is\r\nby no means inconsiderable. Nevertheless the field is\r\nnot altogether barren, for it can be made to yield valuable\r\ninformation as to the character and direction of cultural\r\nstreams, and it is perhaps especially productive in just\r\nthose periods where our other sources of information are\r\nmost meagre.\r\n\r\nThe history of medicine in this great stretch of time is\r\nsharply divided into two parts by an event of great importance\r\nfor the development of the human intellect. That\r\nevent is the arrival in the West of the Arabian learning, the\r\nremnant of Greek science that had dwelt in the Moslem\r\nworld to find its way again to the Occident at a date which\r\nvaried in different countries but which may roughly be placed\r\nat the twelfth century [Fig. 31]. It is with pre-Arabian",
  "p134.png": "material only that we shall deal here, and to it we may attach\r\nthe title of Dark Age Medicine. But it must be remembered\r\nthat for medicine the Dark Age of our notation extends far\r\nbeyond the limits usually assigned to that period by historians.\r\nSo far as England is concerned some of its documents\r\nundoubtedly date from as late as the thirteenth century.\r\nAfter the first half of that century, however, material, other\r\nthan pure folk-medicine, free from Arabian influence is\r\ndistinctly rare.\r\n\r\nThe magical and medical practice of Early England has\r\ncome down to us, in a fragmentary state it is true, by two\r\nchannels, manuscripts and folk-lore. It is to the manuscripts\r\nthat we shall here appeal, but in judging written\r\nmatter produced by a barbarian people among whom the\r\nLatin culture was diffusing itself from the shattered fragments\r\nof the Roman Empire, certain special precautions\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we must resist the temptation of inferring the\r\nprimitiveness or the reverse of any practice from the date\r\nof the manuscript in which it is found. The main agent\r\nin the spread of Southern culture among the English was\r\nthe Church, and its instrument--for our purpose at least--the\r\nart of writing. Consider what happens when a savage\r\ntribe is converted, under modern conditions, to the religion\r\nof a ruling race. First Bible and Prayer Book are translated\r\nand these circulate among the earliest proselytes, who learn\r\nto read and write from devotional works. Later the\r\npurposes of Law and Commerce are subserved by the\r\nwritten language. But it is not until generations have\r\npassed, and the art of writing has become far more familiar,\r\nthat we expect to find the intimate relations of life expressing\r\nthemselves through the new medium.\r\n\r\nSo with the documents of Early English origin. If\r\nwe turn to an eighth-century writer such as Bede we are\r\nfaced with purely ecclesiastical material, bearing hardly a\r\ntrace of the heathenism of his father or grandfather and\r\nalmost without any indication that the imported culture was",
  "p135.png": "a new thing in his part of the world. There is scarcely the\r\nmention of a heathen god or hero and practically no word\r\nof native magic. The works of Bede might have been\r\nwritten by a foreign missionary instead of by an Englishman,\r\nfor any information as to native customs that they contain,\r\nwhile of native medicine there is not a particle though there\r\nare plenty of medical references. On the other hand, such\r\nmanuscripts as Beowulf, or, more important for our purpose,\r\nthe Lacnunga (Harley 585), are not earlier than the eleventh\r\ncentury, and yet are full of the more primitive material. In\r\nspite of its late date the Lacnunga is our best source of the\r\nprimitive medicine of this country untouched by Christian\r\ninfluence, and its compiler does not hesitate to name the\r\nnorthern gods, Woden and the \u00c6sir, in the weaving of his\r\nspells. The attitude of the writer of the Lacnunga to this\r\nmaterial is exhibited by the way in which such purely heathen\r\nparagraphs alternate with charms mentioning the sacred\r\npersonages of Christian tradition. But of any understanding\r\nof the nature of the Christian religion he exhibits\r\nnot a trace; for him the efficacy of Christ and Peter is\r\nwholly on a par with that of Woden and the \u00c6sir. It is\r\nthis intrusion of primitive elements into late documents\r\nand the full Christianization of much earlier records, that\r\nmake it impossible to describe our material in the chronological\r\norder of the manuscripts.\r\n\r\nBut there is a second source of error against which we\r\nmust guard. Magic--and all early medicine partakes largely\r\nof the nature of magic--is probably among all peoples,\r\nand certainly among the North European barbarians,\r\nessentially syncretic. Of all forms of cultural influence\r\nit is magic that passes most easily and most rapidly from\r\npeople to people. Any object or process or person, held\r\nin esteem by a superior class, may easily acquire magical\r\npowers among those of lower culture. Quintus Serenus\r\nSammonicus, a Latin physician of the third century, advised\r\nas a remedy for quartan ague the placing of the fourth book\r\nof Homer's Iliad under the sufferer's head! But we may",
  "p136.png": "take a more modern and even more absurd instance of the\r\nease and rapidity of the passage of exotic magical formulae.\r\nIt is told of Justice Holt (1642-1710) that he led a wild youth,\r\nand that on one occasion, finding himself near Oxford and\r\nwithout money, he procured a week's lodging by pretending\r\nto charm away an ague from which his landlady's daughter\r\nwas suffering. He scribbled a few words of Greek on a\r\nscrap of parchment that had been used as a label and, rolling\r\nit up, directed that it should be bound to the girl's wrist\r\nand left there till she was well. Many years after, an old\r\nwoman was brought before him charged with sorcery. The\r\nevidence showed that she professed to cure the fever-stricken\r\nby the application of a magic bit of parchment. Justice\r\nHolt examined the fragment and found it to be the very\r\npiece with which he had worked his miraculous cure many\r\nyears before, for his own Greek words were still legible upon\r\nit. His lordship confessed and the woman, who was acquitted,\r\nwas one of the last to be tried for witchcraft in this country.\r\nIn the course of our discussion we shall encounter Greek\r\nperiapts of this very sort in use among the Anglo-Saxons\r\n(p. 165), but we must not infer from them any more intimate\r\ncontact with the Greek originals.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a third special precaution needed, and this\r\nconcerns the language of the documents. Early English\r\nmagic and medicine has been investigated mainly by philologists,\r\ninterested in the material as literature in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nlanguage but paying less attention to the nature\r\nand affinities of its magical elements. For our purposes,\r\nhowever, we shall have to neglect the linguistic distinction,\r\nfor the actual language in which these documents have come\r\ndown to us--English or Latin--is hardly more than an\r\naccident. The magic and medicine of Early England must\r\nbe studied as a whole if we wish to learn something of the\r\ncultural factors that have gone to make up this remarkable\r\nsystem, or to gain a true picture of the attitude of the inhabitants\r\nof this country towards the healing art, before the\r\narrival of that scholastic method and Arabian learning",
  "p137.png": "which wrought nearly as great a mental revolution in the\r\nthirteenth, as the experimental method and scientific attitude\r\nin the seventeenth century (see p. 75 ff).\r\n\r\nBefore we turn to the medico-magical material itself a\r\nword may be said concerning the men for whom it was\r\nwritten and by whom it was used.

By an examination of the manuscripts themselves\r\nand an investigation of ancient library catalogues we\r\ncan form a good idea of the material available for distribution\r\namong the barbarians of the North and West between the\r\nseventh and the eleventh centuries. The task is rendered\r\npossible by the fact that the characteristic Dark Age medicine\r\nis singularly constant in character, whether it comes\r\nfrom Southern Italy, Rhineland, Gaul, or Switzerland.\r\nThis system of monkish medicine was practised in its\r\nentirety at such a centre, for instance, as the Anglo-Saxon\r\nsettlement of St. Gall. We have even a ninth-century\r\nplan of a hospital and physic garden projected there.

Their work is still incomplete and our\r\nsurvey--necessarily brief--must be regarded moreover as\r\nbut provisional.\r\n\r\nThe medical writings of the Dark Age that are classical\r\nin origin may be classed under three headings:\r\n\r\n(a) Translations of Greek works into Latin. Of these\r\nmore than sixty are known to have been in circulation\r\nin the Dark Ages.

These are mostly the\r\nwork of Provincials, Barbarians, or Graeco-Italians, and\r\nare often admixed with local superstitions. Among the\r\nmore popular were:\r\n\r\nPseudo-Dioscorides, De herbis feminis (sixth century?[**spaced?]).\r\n\r\nPseudo-Apuleius, De herbis (fourth century).\r\n\r\nSextus Placitus Papyriensis, De Medicina ex Animalibus\r\n(fourth century?).\r\n\r\nMarcellus Empiricus of Bordeaux, De Medicamentis\r\n(first half of fifth century).\r\n\r\nPseudo-Hippocratic Epistles (fourth century?).\r\n\r\nThe general form of all these works was fixed between\r\nthe fourth and the sixth centuries.\r\n\r\n(c) A special position must be accorded to the Natural\r\nHistory of Pliny and of his abstractor, Plinius Valerianus,\r\nwhich were available in England at an early date.

It is therefore probable\r\nthat the scheme which Byrhtfer\u00f0 introduces had arrived in\r\nEngland before the eighth century.\r\n\r\nMore noteworthy is a short passage that is probably the\r\nearliest medical text by an English hand, a small ninth-century\r\nfragment consisting of three paragraphs or sentences\r\nin a manuscript now at Paris (Bibl. Nat. Lat. 11411). This\r\nmanuscript was written at Echternach, a monastery founded\r\nby the Englishman Willibrord, the apostle of the Frisians\r\n(657-738), and to Echternach, for many generations after\r\nhis death, English and Irish monks were wont to flock.\r\nThe document itself is in the midst of an Hisperic text and\r\nexhibits undoubted Irish influence. All three paragraphs\r\nof this short text are taken from medical works known to\r\nhave been in circulation during the Dark Ages and forming\r\npart of the characteristic medical system of that period.\r\nWe will, however, here consider only the first paragraph,\r\nwhich may be translated thus:\r\n\r\n'The device of the sphere of the philosopher Pythagoras,\r\nwhich Apollonius described for the discovery of anything\r\nconcerning the sick. Thou shouldst determine the day\r\nof the week and of the moon (on which he fell sick) and (the\r\nnumerical value) of his name according to the letters\r\nwritten below. Add them together and divide by thirty and\r\nconsider the remainder. Examine what is written below,[1]\r\nand if it fall in the upper part he will live and do well; if\r\nbelow, he will die' [Fig. 54].\r\n\r\nThe sphere of Pythagoras is a recognized magical device.\r\nIt is possibly of Egyptian origin, but it certainly spread to\r\nEurope through Greek intermediaries. It is translated\r\n\r\n1 The text has here in spreta, which is meaningless.

During the Dark and Middle Ages this diagram\r\nis common in the English manuscripts, where it is variously\r\nattributed to Hippocrates, Democritus, Apuleius, Apollonius,\r\nPythagoras, Columcille, Bede, Petosiris, Nechepso,\r\nand Plato! Quite a number of specimens date from\r\nAnglo-Saxon times.\r\n\r\nFig. 54.--The Sphere of Pythagoras according to Bibl. Nat. MS.

We can obtain some answer from its associations.\r\nThe leech-books, whether written in monasteries\r\nor no, are, as we have seen, essentially lay products. But\r\nthe earliest English specimens of magic spheres of Petosiris\r\nare nearly all in liturgical books and associated with blood-*letting\r\ncalendars.

  "p147.png": "\r\n\u00a7 2. Ecclesiastical Elements\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical elements are found throughout the whole\r\ncorpus of Anglo-Saxon medicine and magic. Paternosters\r\naccompany every conceivable medical process. Such elements\r\nare perhaps the least interesting of the factors in\r\nAnglo-Saxon medicine, since they are known from many\r\nsources, are easily recognized, and still survive in folk-*custom.\r\nOne instance, however, is unusual and worthy of\r\nspecial notice.\r\n\r\nIn the Ecclesiastical History of Bede (written 731) it is\r\nrelated how John of Beverley, Bishop of Hexham, came to\r\na monastery where a nun laboured under a grievous disease,\r\nhaving been lately bled in the arm. While engaged in\r\nstudy she had been seized with a violent pain and her wound\r\nswelled so that she was now confined to bed and was sick\r\nunto death. The abbess begged the bishop that he would\r\ngive her his blessing and touch her, for this she believed\r\nmight aid her. The bishop then asked when the maiden\r\nhad been bled, and being told that it was on the fourth day\r\nof the moon he said, 'You did very ill and unskilfully to\r\nbleed her on that day, for I remember that Archbishop\r\nTheodore of blessed memory said that bleeding at that time\r\nwas very dangerous when the light of the moon and the tide\r\nof the ocean is increasing.' Nevertheless the blessing and\r\ntouch of the good bishop restored her to health.\r\n\r\nThe 'blessed Theodore' was the Greek ecclesiastic who\r\ncame to this country as Archbishop of Canterbury in 668.\r\nThe doctrine that connected bleeding with the tides and the\r\nmoon was a commonplace of Greek medicine and was\r\ncertainly adopted at Rome. It is mentioned in the pseudo-Hippocratic\r\nEpistle of Maecenas, but the supposed relation\r\nof the condition of the blood to the tides and moon is\r\ntreated more fully in several works of the Galenic corpus,\r\nespecially in the Regimen in acute diseases and the spurious\r\ntreatise On crises from which Theodore more probably\r\nderived it. It is noteworthy that in the very early Celtic",

Salernitan Texts\r\n\r\nSalernitan texts, like ecclesiastical elements, are easily\r\ntraced and therefore need only brief discussion. Of the\r\nearly history of the medical school of Salerno our conceptions\r\nare still very indefinite, though the surviving early\r\nSouth Italian documents suggest that a knowledge of Greek\r\nmedicine was widely diffused in what was once Magna\r\nGraecia in the seventh and eighth centuries, while hints from\r\nCassiodorus carry us as far back as the sixth century.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the ninth or tenth century this diffused medical\r\nknowledge began to be gathered together at several centres\r\nof which Monte Cassino and Salerno were the most important.\r\nAt the monastery of Monte Cassino the process\r\nwent no further than copying and translating, but at\r\nSalerno a definite lay medical school arose, and in the\r\neleventh century a certain amount of genuine observation\r\nand investigation was being made. The great monument\r\nof that school, the Breslau codex, containing no less than\r\nthirty-five separate medical treatises, has been edited, and\r\nreference to this enables us to detect Salernitan influence\r\nwhere it occurs in early Western medicine.\r\n\r\nOne of the medical treatises in the Anglo-Saxon language,\r\nthe so-called Peri didaxeon, is mainly a translation of the\r\nworks of certain Salernitan writers of the eleventh century,\r\nwhile Latin medical works written in England in the\r\nearly twelfth century may be traced to similar sources. The\r\ninfluence of the Salernitan school extended far beyond the\r\nperiod of which we treat and forms the basis not only of\r\nmuch modern English folk-medicine but also of some of the\r\npractice of the modern herbalist.\r\n\r\n1 The history of the School of Salerno is discussed in greater detail\r\non p. 240.",

Native Teutonic Magic and Herb-Lore\r\n\r\nNative Teutonic magical material may be distinguished\r\nfrom imported elements of Classical, Ecclesiastical, or\r\nSalernitan origin by the presence of four characteristic\r\nelements: the doctrine of specific venoms, the doctrine of\r\nthe nines, the doctrine of the worm as the cause of disease,\r\nand lastly the doctrine of the elf-shot.\r\n\r\nWe call such material 'Native Teutonic,' but it might\r\nmore fitly be termed Indo-Germanic, since these doctrines\r\nare to be found among all Indo-Germanic peoples and\r\nare encountered even in the Vedas. Yet when we meet\r\nthese four doctrines in passages of English origin without\r\nclassical or Celtic elements, and especially when combined\r\nwith references to Teutonic gods or customs, the material\r\nmay with reasonable certainty be regarded as having been\r\nbrought by the Anglo-Saxon tribes from their Continental\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best specimen of the Native Teutonic magic\r\nis the Lay of the Nine Healing Herbs, of which we here give\r\na section from the Lacnunga.\r\n\r\nDha genam woden                Then took Wodan\r\nVIIII wuldortanas,             Nine magic twigs,\r\nsloh dha tha naeddran          Smote then that serpent\r\nthaet heo on VIIII tofleah.

Woden smiting the\r\nworm is a well-known Teutonic myth. In the mythical\r\ncycle Woden was primarily the dispenser of victory, but\r\nhe was also the bringer of many other forms of good luck\r\nand especially of good health.

In\r\nthe Gaelic form, however, Christ has taken the place of\r\nWoden. The same charm is known also from other Indo-Germanic\r\nsources, as, for instance, the Atharva Veda.\r\n\r\nBy the Romans Woden was early identified with the god\r\nMercury, whom he resembles in that from him proceed\r\ndiseases and their cure. He also influenced the casting of\r\nlots as a means of bringing good luck. Now the word tan\r\nin the Lay of the Nine Healing Herbs which we have translated\r\ntwig (line 2) is specifically a twig used in casting lots.\r\n'Augury and Divination by lot,' writes Tacitus of the\r\nGermans, 'no people practise more diligently. The use\r\nof the lots is simple[**missing punctuation] A little bough is cut from a fruit-bearing\r\ntree and cut into slips; these are distinguished by\r\nrunes (notis quibusdam), and thrown casually and at random\r\nover a white cloth.' From the twig for casting lots tan\r\ncame to mean the lot itself. The nine twigs that Woden\r\ntakes up are these twigs of fate which are to bring a\r\nbetter lot to the sick man on recitation of the magic song.\r\n\r\nFollowing the introduction of Woden and his magic",
  "p152.png": "twigs is a description of their powers (lines 9-26). The\r\nnine poisons or flying things are enumerated, and the nine\r\ndiseases that they produce. The term gebl\u00e6d which we\r\nhave translated blister is from bl\u00e6d, a common term for a\r\nbreath or spirit, and the description of disease as a bl\u00e6d,\r\nblast or blister, is encountered frequently in Teutonic folklore.\r\nThe wind, the results of which are manifest while\r\nthe agent is invisible, bears an obvious analogy to disease.\r\nThe onfligene, the on-flying things (line 8), are the venoms\r\nwhich blow about in the air and, reaching the surface of the\r\nbody, produce their characteristic diseases. They are\r\nrepeatedly referred to in a refrain of the Lay as 'the\r\nloathed things that rove through the land,' a phrase also\r\nencountered in modern Danish charms. Thus the best\r\ntranslation both of onfligen and of gebl\u00e6d would perhaps be\r\ninfection, though our modern conception of infection is\r\ncertainly not contained in it. There is a reflection of the\r\nnine venoms in King Lear (III, 4) where\r\n\r\nSwithold footed thrice the old (i.e. the wold or weald);\r\nHe met the nightmare and her nine-fold.\r\n\r\nThese nine-fold of the nightmare may be followed at large\r\nthrough Teutonic magic.\r\n\r\nAfter the nine venoms and the nine diseases comes a\r\ncall addressed to the four quarters of heaven from which the\r\nfour winds or blasts bring disease (lines 27-33). The division\r\nof the winds according to the four cardinal points is of\r\nIndo-Germanic origin developed independently of classical\r\ninfluence. The method of description of these winds is\r\nin contrast to the usual Greek and Latin system which gave\r\nspecial names to the various prevalent winds, a method\r\nmore applicable to the regular Mediterranean climate with\r\nits periodic recurrence of winds from definite directions.\r\nThe earliest Anglo-Saxon glosses from the eighth century\r\nonward contain the Greek names of winds taken probably\r\nfrom Plinius Valerianus, equated with the suitable geographical\r\ndirection in terms of cardinal points [Fig. 52].",
  "p153.png": "\r\nThe custom of uttering a charm against disease successively\r\nto the four cardinal points is also of Indo-Germanic\r\norigin and is found in the Atharva Veda. It occurs over\r\nand over again in Anglo-Saxon literature and is applied\r\nwith both Christian and pagan invocations.

It is related to, though not necessarily derived\r\nfrom, the Christian view of baptism.\r\n\r\nIn the last two lines that we have quoted from the Lay\r\nthe venom is described as being blown away by the power\r\nof the incantation, this being an inversion of the process by\r\nwhich the flying things were blown on to the surface of the\r\nbody. As the winds have blown the disease to the sufferer\r\nso will the magician, by the might of his song, blow it from\r\nhim. The action of blowing is a common accompaniment\r\nof Teutonic magic.\r\n\r\nBut there remains an English doctrine concerning disease,\r\nwhich we have not yet discussed, a belief which the English\r\nshared also with the continental Teutons and with the\r\nCelts. The Teutonic peoples had not the belief in posses-*",

By the Teutonic\r\ntribes a large amount of disease was attributed, not to\r\noccupation by, but to the action of supernatural beings,\r\nelves, \u00c6sir, smiths, or witches whose shafts fired at the\r\nsufferer produced his torments. Anglo-Saxon and even\r\nMiddle English literature is replete with the notion of disease\r\ncaused by the arrows of mischievous supernatural beings.\r\nThis theory of disease we shall, for brevity, speak of as the\r\ndoctrine of the elf-shot.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon tribes located these malicious elves\r\neverywhere, but especially in the wild uncultivated wastes\r\nwhere they loved to shoot their envenomed darts at the\r\npasser-by. There were water-elves, too, perhaps identical\r\nwith the Nixies of whom we learn from Celtic sources.\r\nSuch creatures were perhaps personifications of the deadly\r\npowers of marshes and waterlogged land. A water-elf\r\nis perhaps thought to have attacked one waterlogged with\r\ndropsy in the following passage:\r\n\r\nMS.

Thus in\r\nDenmark a whitlow is cured by thrusting the finger into\r\nthe ground and leaving it for some time, and a sick child\r\nis lightly covered with earth; and in Holland, when a man\r\nhas been struck by lightning--a form of elf-shot--he is\r\ninterred as far as the neck to extract the evil.

Babylonian-Assyrian\r\nmedicine was based on the theory that disease was due to\r\nthe entry of a demon into the patient's body; hence formulae\r\nfor exorcism became of great importance. Moreover,\r\nwhat was bad for the demon must be good for the patient;\r\nhence arose the idea of nauseous drugs to disgust the demon\r\nand weary him of his habitat. (It should be said that while\r\nthere is no demonism in early Greek native medicine, there\r\nare traces of it in Orphic literature.)\r\n\r\n(3) Magic, a term which, while leaving undefined, we\r\nmay provisionally regard as primitive unorganized belief\r\nas to the relation of cause and effect.\r\n\r\n(4) 'Common-sense' empirical knowledge.\r\n\r\nAs Greek medicine decayed and passed into its Byzantine\r\nstage, demoniac and magical elements became more prominent\r\nand scientific elements receded. This process, however,\r\nhad not gone so far but that the Greek medicine\r\ndistributed among barbarian peoples by the time of the\r\nbreak up of the Empire still contained traces of all four\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nNow in true native Teutonic medicine we can only expect",

Beside the original stratum of demonism in\r\nGreek medicine, which was presumably drawn more or\r\nless directly from Babylonian sources, much new belief\r\nconcerning demons had been developed in the Greek\r\nsystem by Christianity, and had been propagated from an\r\nearly date by the spread of that religion in the West. The\r\npathology of the New Testament is mainly demonic and\r\nmany of the miracles of healing are exorcisms. There\r\nwere devils of blindness, dumbness, madness, and epilepsy,\r\nand Luke the physician regarded the 'great fever' of\r\nSimon's wife's mother in the light of a demon, for Jesus, he\r\nsays, 'stood over her and rebuked the fever; and it left\r\nher.' So also the infirmities of Mary Magdalene were of\r\nthe nature of seven evil spirits--the demons of early Christianity,\r\nlike those of the Mesopotamian system, were often\r\ngrouped in sevens--and Peter considered that all those\r\nwhom Jesus healed had been 'oppressed of the Devil.'\r\nThe final end of disease is itself a demon's work, since the\r\ninspirer of sin is indirectly the author of death, the last\r\nenemy that shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\nSo for the fathers of the Church disease was largely the\r\nwork of demons. Of some importance for our purpose\r\nare the views of Irenaeus (2nd century A.D.) as preserving\r\na record of that early Gallic Christianity which may be supposed\r\nto have first influenced the British Isles. He acknowledges\r\nthe antiquity and effectiveness of exorcisms\r\nother than Christian, and thus prepares us for the pagan",

We do encounter, however, Anglo-Saxon\r\nmagical processes designed to remove, not indeed\r\nthe demon himself, but the materies morbi projected into\r\nthe body by supernatural beings--in other words formulae\r\nfor the extraction of the elf-shot.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 5. Celtic Magic\r\n\r\nThe Celtic influence in the Anglo-Saxon material is\r\nelusive and yet pervasive, but the difficulty of tracing it\r\nmay be a result of the common heritage of the two cultures\r\nand the common external influences to which they were\r\nboth subjected. Nevertheless, clear cases of the definite\r\nincursion of the Celtic magic into the Anglo-Saxon system\r\ncan be adduced; these may be roughly classed according\r\nas they are derived from (a) Celtic magic proper, or from\r\n(b) that form of Celtic magic which filters through the\r\npeculiar Hisperic medium.\r\n\r\n(a) True Celtic magic in the Leechdoms is betrayed\r\nby a number of Celtic words and phrases used as charms.\r\nFrom such phrases, however, we can argue no intimate\r\ncontact between the two peoples. A somewhat closer\r\nconnexion is suggested, however, by the use of the so-called\r\n'Circle of Columcille.' The legend of the origin of this\r\nmagical figure is contained in the Irish life of the Saint by\r\nManus O'Donnell composed in 1532.\r\n\r\n'On a time Ethne the mother of Columcille was in the",
  "p159.png": "place called Gartan, and it was the night before Columcille\r\nwas born, and their appeared a fair youth in shining raiment,\r\nand he said she should bring forth on the morrow the son\r\nthat was promised her to bear. And he told her there\r\nwas a broad flagstone in the lake, to the south of the place\r\nwhere she was.... And he told her to let bring that flagstone\r\nto a certain place ... and that thereon should God\r\nwill the child to be brought forth of her.\r\n\r\nFigs. 56 and 57.--Two Early Celtic Stone Crosses.

  "p160.png": "had been told her, and she let bring it from the foresaid\r\nplace. And albeit it floated on the surface of the lake, and\r\nEthne's folk brought it away with them without labour,\r\nyet certain it is that it were a task for thirty men to bring it\r\nfrom the lake to the place where it is to-day....\r\n\r\n'And it befell that the foresaid flagstone was under him\r\nat his birth, and the child rested him crosswise thereon,\r\nand the flagstone opened for him in such wise that it left\r\na place for him therein. And the figure of that cross is on\r\nthat stone from that time to this day. And that flagstone\r\nremaineth in that place for working of marvels and wonders.'[1]\r\n\r\nIrish archaeologists have frequently described a type of\r\nlarge flat stone, into the surface of which there has been\r\ncut in remote antiquity a design consisting primarily of a\r\ncross surrounded by a circle. A fine specimen of this type\r\nof Celtic monument is known from the glen to which\r\nColumcille's name is still attached [Figs. 56 and 57]. To such\r\nstones magical powers were attached and their use passed\r\nover to the English. In an Anglo-Saxon manuscript of the\r\neleventh century, over the figure of a circle with a cross\r\ninscribed within it [Fig. 58] we read:\r\n\r\nMS. Cott. Vit. E. xviii, fo. 13 v.\r\n\r\n\u00deis is sancte columcille circul\r\nWrit \u00feisne circul mid \u00feines cnifes\r\norde on anum mealm stane \u204a sleah\r\n\u00e6nne stacan on middan \u00feam ymbhagan.\r\n\u204a lege \u00feone stane on\r\nuppan \u00fean stacan \u00fe\u00e6t he beo\r\neall under eor\u00f0an. butan \u00feam gewritenan.\r\n\r\nThis is the circle of Saint Columcille.\r\nInscribe this circle with the\r\npoint of thy knife on a soft stone\r\n& strike a stake into the middle\r\nof the bee-enclosure, & lay the\r\nstone above the stake so that it\r\nis all under ground except that\r\nwhich is inscribed.\r\n\r\nThe stake was presumably to prevent the stone sinking\r\nand the stone thus laid was used for charming bees, but its\r\nform and title betray its Irish affinities.

  "p162.png": "a character that we must devote a few lines to a general\r\ndiscussion of it.\r\n\r\nFor the last half-century philogists have been interested\r\nand puzzled by a most curious group of early documents\r\nof Irish or English origin. The longest of these and in\r\nmany respects the most striking is a rough metrical composition\r\nknown as the Hisperica Famina, a very peculiar work\r\nthat has given its name to what is almost a special language\r\nand literature. This language and literature we have\r\nalready discussed (p. 117 ff.).\r\n\r\nThe Hisperic authors were men of Celtic speech who\r\nhad access to Anglo-Saxon sources, and they did not\r\nhesitate to introduce words of Celtic and English origin\r\ninto their writings. Thus arose a jargon which was\r\nsubstantially a special language. The bounds in space\r\nand time within which this peculiar medium flourished\r\nare not altogether certain. The centre of activity was\r\nprobably in Ireland, though Wales, Cornwall, and possibly\r\neven Brittany influenced the product. It was exclusively\r\na literary language, and thus its influence extended from\r\nthe Celtic peoples to the Anglo-Saxon monasteries which\r\nlay under a cultural debt to their more anciently Christianized\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nThe period during which the Hisperic language flourished\r\ncan be roughly stated as the seventh century. It may have\r\nbeen practised for fifty or a hundred years before then,\r\nand there is one belated document--copied no doubt for\r\nits supposed magical value--of the sixteenth century. There\r\nis good evidence, however, that the language was still\r\nstudied and understood in England as late as the tenth\r\ncentury, since Hisperic words are included in Anglo-Saxon\r\nglossaries of that period. The most important manuscripts\r\nof the literature are, however, of the eighth or ninth\r\ncentury, and they are mostly in the 'insular' script.\r\n\r\nCertain Hisperic documents, and especially that known as\r\nthe Lorica of Gildas the Briton (p. 122 ff.), were used as\r\ncharms by the Anglo-Saxon speaking tribes.

Southern Plant-Lore\r\n\r\nOf all the elements in the Anglo-Saxon medical system,\r\nby far the most attractive is the plant-lore. The English\r\nwere a people who early exhibited some power in the\r\nobservation of nature and considerable artistic skill, but their\r\nachievements in these matters were greatly hampered by\r\nthe respect paid by them to the written records of a higher\r\ncivilization. Thus the Early English texts containing\r\ndescriptions of plants are merely bad copies or worse\r\ntranslations of works which had existed in Latin dress from\r\nat least as early as the seventh century, and in these no new\r\nor original element can be expected. But when we turn to\r\nthe figures with which these herbals are illustrated we are\r\nmet with an entirely new and very interesting series of\r\nphenomena. Indeed, the story of plant representation\r\nthroughout early barbarian Europe is a peculiar and in\r\nmany ways an isolated development which cannot easily\r\nbe fitted into the general account of the history of art, and\r\nfor this there is a special reason. Most expressions of the\r\nmediaeval artistic spirit were prepared only with an eye\r\nto the emotions that they raised, but in the case of the\r\nillustrations to herbals there was a definite utilitarian object.\r\nAs, however, we devote a special essay to the descent of the\r\nherbal texts and figures, we need not deal with it further\r\nhere.

Palaeolithic\r\nman has left us many samples of\r\nhis artistic skill. Indeed, like his\r\nmodern successor the diminutive\r\nBushman, who is also an expert in\r\nthe portrayal of animal life, palaeolithic\r\nman was often an artist to\r\nthe finger-tips. Yet with all his\r\npowers he seems always to have neglected the portrayal of\r\nplants.

They did, however, cultivate the 'collector's\r\ninstinct,' which may be regarded as an earlier and more\r\nprimitive stage in the progress of the human mind towards\r\nscience and is the stage represented by the herbal. In\r\nthe eighteenth dynasty, about 1500 B.C., Thothmes III\r\nsent out an expedition to Syria which brought back with\r\nit a number of new and strange plants. The figures of\r\nthese plants were sculptured on the walls of Karnak, where\r\nthey may be seen to this day [Fig. 70]. They are diagrammatic\r\nto a degree and few can be actually identified. On\r\nthem, however, is an inscription which may be translated\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nYear 25 of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Living for Ever.\r\nPlants which His Majesty found in the country of Syria. All plants\r\nthat grow, all goodly flowers that are in the Divine Land (i.e. country\r\neast of Egypt) ... His Majesty saith, 'As I live, all these plants exist\r\nin very truth; there is not a line of falsehood among them. My Majesty\r\nhath wrought this to cause them to be before my father Amon, in this\r\ngreat hall for ever and ever.'\r\n\r\nIs not this perpetuation the motive of the herbal, and\r\nhave we not here a herbal in stone? It was among another\r\npeople, however, that the more permanent herbal tradition\r\narose. The herbal tradition that we inherit comes to us from\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nThe three great influences that converged on the Greeks,\r\nthose spoiled darlings of history, were the culture of\r\nEgypt, of Mesopotamia, and of the Minoan peoples. The\r\narts of Mesopotamia and of Crete, so far as plants are\r\nconcerned, go through much the same history that we have\r\ntraced in Egypt. Nor is the great art of the Greeks themselves\r\nvery different in relation to our subject. In Greek\r\nart of the classical age we find no worthy representations\r\nof vegetable life. Plants are freely used for design and\r\nwoven into the motives of patterns, but living and growing\r\nplants are hardly ever found. The triumphs of Greek art",

Knowing nothing precise\r\nabout such matters, we do not examine or analyse the paintings. All\r\nthat we ask is a sort of indistinct and deceptive mode of shadowing\r\nthem forth. But when our artist treats the human form we are quick\r\nto find faults, and our familiar knowledge makes us severe judges of one\r\nwho does not render every point exactly.\r\n\r\nAt a very early date the Greeks brought the art of\r\nmedicine within the range of the sciences, and thus provided\r\nthe theme for the herbal. We have a number of\r\nGreek medical works of the fifth and fourth centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era in the so-called Hippocratic Collection.\r\nFrom that group of works modern investigators\r\nhave gathered a list of between three and four hundred\r\nplants. It is remarkable that no contemporary ancient\r\nauthor seems to have thought of doing this. It was not\r\nuntil towards the end of the Hippocratic period that the\r\nfirst Greek herbal was put together.\r\n\r\nThe author of this first Greek herbal was Diocles of\r\nCarystus in Euboeia. He practised in Athens with\r\nenormous reputation in the first half of the fourth century\r\nB.C., and is believed to have influenced Aristotle deeply.\r\nHis book on plants has unfortunately disappeared even\r\nmore completely than his other works. We know only\r\nenough of it to say that it was a systematic treatise in\r\nwhich short descriptions of plants and their habitats were\r\nfollowed by an account of their uses in medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the period in which Diocles worked, the tiny independent\r\nStates of Greece were beginning to be over-*shadowed\r\nby the growing power of Macedon. The\r\ngeneration which followed saw the profound modification\r\nof the Greek outlook that Alexander's career was to bring.\r\nStarting across Asia Minor and penetrating to the remotest\r\nrecesses of Syria and Egypt, of Babylonia, Persia, Media,\r\nTurkestan to Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and reaching the",

They were carried\r\non with all the scientific resources of the day. The\r\nnavy especially, then as now the most scientific branch of\r\nthe fighting force, was active in collecting such data, and\r\nmuch of the information concerning foreign plants, found\r\nin the pages of later Greek botanists, was taken from these\r\nnaval records. Chief among Alexander's admirals was\r\nNearchus, who led the fleet from the mouth of the Indus,\r\nnear Karachi, along the Baluchistan coast to Hormuz in\r\nthe mouth of the Persian Gulf, and then up the eastern\r\nside to the head of the Gulf. Fragments of an account of\r\nthis journey by Nearchus himself contain admirable\r\ndescriptions of the banyan tree or Indian fig, of the various\r\nspecies of mangrove along the coast, of the cotton plant\r\nfound in the islands of the Gulf, and of the great spiny\r\nEuphorbias of the Baluchistan wastes. Another expedition\r\nunder Androsthenes explored Bahrein on the western\r\nside of the Gulf, and its leader prepared a monograph\r\nof his voyage which was largely devoted to botanical\r\ntopics. Thus the Alexandrian expeditions brought to\r\nGreece a wealth of the botanical material out of which a\r\nherbal might be built.\r\n\r\nWhile the conquests of Alexander were in progress,\r\nAristotle, himself an admirable naturalist, found time\r\namong his philosophical labours to make a complete sketch\r\nof organic nature containing a section devoted to plants.\r\nThis Aristotelian treatise on plants has disappeared, but\r\nby way of compensation we have works by Aristotle's\r\npupil, Theophrastus of Eresus, sometimes spoken of as\r\nthe 'father of botany.'

Nearly all\r\npeoples, ancient or modern, seem to have developed something\r\nof a medical herb-lore, frequently mixed with much\r\nmagical material. The recipients of this traditional herb-lore\r\namong the Greeks were the so-called rhizotomists.\r\nThese, as a class, were ignorant men corresponding in a\r\nmeasure to our herbalists. They were very superstitious\r\nand practised a complex ritual in the gathering of their\r\ndrugs, as still do many people on the same cultural level.\r\nFragments of this ritual have survived, and we can detect\r\nin it ceremonies similar to those recorded in mediaeval\r\nherbals and leech-books and still closely followed by\r\nEuropean peasants. The profession and the tradition of\r\nthe rhizotomists extended from Greek into mediaeval and\r\neven to modern times, and they and their work are not\r\ninfrequently illustrated in the manuscripts and early\r\nprinted books [Fig. 71].

The earliest collection\r\nof this sort that we have is perhaps the Alexipharmaca\r\nof Nicander, written in the century following Theophrastus.\r\nIt is a wretched production--in spite of the praise of\r\nCicero--ill-written and obscure, with nothing poetic about\r\nit save its form.

If Galen is just in\r\nhis criticisms, it resembled later herbals in several other\r\nrespects, for he tells us that Pamphilus described plants\r\nwhich he had never seen, and mingled much absurd and\r\nsuperstitious matter\r\nwith his imperfect descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe art of plant\r\nillustration founded by\r\nCrateuas was extended\r\nif not developed during\r\nthe first century of the\r\nChristian era.

As the general\r\ncharacter of the Greek mind deteriorated, such science as\r\nsurvived passed into the hands of the various Oriental\r\npeoples who went to make up the Byzantine Empire. Of\r\nthese the Nestorian Christians entered most freely into\r\nmedical studies and turned into Syriac the more popular\r\nof the Greek medical works. In after centuries, when the\r\nwhole of the Near East came under the power of Islam, it\r\nwas from these Nestorians that medical knowledge mainly\r\nradiated. First Gondisapur and then Baghdad became the\r\ncentre of their activities, and at the last centre most of\r\nthe work of translation of Greek wisdom was accomplished.\r\nIt was thus that Dioscorides passed into Arabic and later\r\ninto Persian. The figures of the plants of the Greek\r\nDioscorides tradition, taken mostly from the Mediterranean\r\nlittoral, were however useless to the Oriental reader. New\r\nfigures were prepared and items were added. A new\r\ntradition thus arose which continues to this day.\r\n\r\nThe main line of herbal development, that of Western\r\nEurope, which we have now to consider, has shown far\r\ngreater vitality than the original Greek stock from which\r\nit sprang. The chief interest of the Western herbal\r\ndepends on the history of the art which it embodies. An\r\nunderstanding of the development of any form of Western\r\nart in the first centuries of the Christian era depends on the\r\nrealization of the early differentiation of the outlook of\r\nEast and West within the Roman Empire. To the political\r\nhistorian the breach between the Eastern and the Western\r\nEmpire is marked by certain important events, such as\r\nthe separation of the Empire into an Eastern and a Western\r\nrealm in 364, or its final division in 395.

In this type of art, devoid of the freedom and the\r\nidealism of the great art of Greece, plants were treated as\r\nthey had never been before (p. 2 ff.). In such specimens\r\nas the Tomb of the Haterii in the Lateran Museum,\r\nor the famous well-head at Vienna, we have the work\r\nof a faithful student of nature (see Figs. 1-3). In the\r\nmural paintings in the Villa Livia we have a treatment of\r\nplants so close and natural that they would serve for a\r\nmodern botanical textbook.\r\n\r\nRoman art had, however, but a meteoric career. After\r\nthe first century it steadily deteriorated. The causes\r\nof this deterioration may be sought in many directions.\r\nThe growing estrangement of East and West deprived\r\nRoman art of a source of inspiration. The social disturbances\r\nof the time, the rise of the new religion and the\r\ncharacter of what survived of the old pagan philosophy\r\nwere none of them favourable to the free development of\r\nan independent art. Most of all, the exclusively literary\r\ncharacter of education in the late Empire told against all\r\noriginality and independence of thought. The whole\r\nstress was on classical models, and imitation was elevated",
  "p184.png": "into the very standard of excellence. As Christianity\r\ngained way on paganism it too developed an art, but it was\r\nan art in which even the details were copied from an older\r\nsource. Such was the atmosphere in which the Western\r\nherbal tradition arose.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance the Latin or Western herbals were\r\nnothing but translations of Greek works. They were part\r\nof a regular system of translation of medical works which\r\nbegan with the rendering of Celsus in the first pre-Christian\r\ncentury, and extended to Cassiodorus in the sixth century\r\nof the Christian era. In the case of the herbals the earliest\r\nLatin production seems to have been a translation of such\r\na work on herbs about the year 400. To this the name of\r\nApuleius became attached. The herbal of Apuleius was\r\nprobably illustrated in the original, for though the Greek\r\nsource has not been found, fragments of a very similar\r\nGreek work with illustrations comparable to those in the\r\nearliest known manuscript of the Latin Apuleius have been\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nDuring the third and fourth centuries the diversity of\r\ntongues within the Empire had created a difficulty of\r\ncomprehending medical terms. Provincials, however perfectly\r\nthey might understand Latin, retained their local\r\nnames for such familiar objects as herbs. To meet their\r\ndifficulty, lists or lexicons of plant synonyms were prepared\r\nand one of these was very early incorporated into the\r\ntext of the Apuleius herbal.\r\n\r\nA manuscript of the Apuleius herbal, dating from the\r\nsixth or early seventh century, is one of the treasures of the\r\nlibrary at Leyden [Figs. 79 and 80]. Like the Juliana Anicia\r\nmanuscript, it is a landmark in the history both of botany\r\nand of manuscript illustration. There is good evidence\r\nthat the illustrations of this Leyden manuscript are copied\r\nfrom a manuscript two centuries older. It contains, too,\r\nthe dictionary of synonyms that continued to be slavishly\r\nrepeated through scores of generations on to the end of\r\nthe Middle Ages, when not only were the dialects of the",

The Leyden Apuleius is the\r\nvery recognizable ancestor of a whole host of manuscript\r\nherbals. These were copied and re-copied throughout\r\nthe ages, naturally deteriorating a little at each stage.\r\n\r\nFinally, the period of printing is reached. The first\r\nprinted herbal is again our Apuleius; some of its old figures\r\npass into print [Fig. 63, cf. Fig. 64] and with them the same\r\nsynonyms of the dead and forgotten tongues. Man is\r\nan imitative animal, but we doubt if any better instance of\r\nhis imitativeness could be found than this constant copying\r\nand re-copying, for over a thousand years, with enormous\r\nlabour and technical skill, of a futile work with its unrecognizable\r\nfigures and its incomprehensible vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe herbarium of Apuleius represents perhaps the first\r\nattempt to turn a Greek work of this type into Latin.\r\nSoon, however, a considerable part of the work of Dioscorides\r\nhimself became available. When the actual work\r\nof translation took place we cannot be quite sure, but it\r\nwas probably during the course of the Gothic domination\r\n(493-555). We see in it the handiwork of Cassiodorus\r\n(490-585), the Chancellor of the Emperor Theodoric the\r\nGoth. Cassiodorus grew tired of political power at an\r\nearly age, and spent the very long evening of his life--he\r\nretired at 50, and died at 95--at his birthplace, Squillace,\r\na town in the extreme south, which looks into the Gulf\r\nbetween the toe and heel of Italy. At Squillace was a\r\nBenedictine house, and Cassiodorus took great interest in\r\nits literary welfare. It was an age which looked exclusively\r\nto the past, and Cassiodorus was a creature of his age.\r\nFortunate it is for us that he was so, for but for his activity\r\nit is possible that no complete Latin literary work--save\r\nthat of Virgil--would have reached our time.\r\n\r\nIn his Institutiones divinarum et humanarum litterarum\r\nhe tells his monks that: 'If you have not sufficient facility\r\nwith Greek writing, then you can turn to the herbarium\r\nof Dioscorides, which describes and figures the herbs of",
  "p186.png": "the field with wonderful faithfulness.' Copies of this\r\nLatin translation of Dioscorides exist. They are richly\r\nillustrated and some of the figures can be traced to the\r\nJuliana Anicia and its congeners. In them we see passing\r\non to the Middle Ages some of the old figures which\r\nCrateuas had prepared in the first century B.C. Others of\r\nthe figures of the Latin Dioscorides were prepared in Italy\r\nat a later date, and in them we may see the deteriorated\r\ndescendants of Augustan art.\r\n\r\nBesides the genuine translation of the work of Dioscorides\r\nthere were, however, other herbals to which his name\r\nbecame attached. These were put together in the earlier\r\nMiddle Ages. One of them is the so-called De herbis\r\nfeminis Dioscoridis. This pseudo-Dioscoridean work was\r\ncompiled in Latin at some early date out of sources such\r\nas Apuleius and the Latin Dioscorides. Another document,\r\nwhich scholars have been accustomed to distinguish by\r\nspelling the name in the mediaeval fashion, 'Dyascorides,'\r\nwas put together at Salerno from numerous Latin sources\r\nwhich do not include the true Dioscorides. Manuscripts\r\nof these works are provided with figures, and they form\r\nthe bases of later mediaeval herbals.\r\n\r\nThe figures of these herbals are more interesting than\r\nthe texts which they illustrate. The copying of the figures\r\nfrom hand to hand, century after century, gave rise to\r\ntraditions or schools of plant illustration. Even in the\r\nLeyden Apuleius most of the pictures are already heavily\r\nstylized and far removed from nature drawing [Figs. 79 and\r\n80]. This model remained little altered till the tenth century,\r\nand herbals of that period from the Rhineland and Italy\r\nstill preserve pictures very close to the original type.\r\nThen, however, there set in a new method of drawing\r\nwhich, taking old models, deeply modified them. The\r\nnew type of plant-drawing appeared perhaps first in\r\nnorthern France, but soon spread over Europe. The\r\nplants depicted became more and more diagrammatic and\r\nthe drawing heavier. The style reached its climax in the",

The pictures are\r\ntechnically remarkable, but as plants they have become\r\ntotally unrecognizable [Plates IX and X].\r\n\r\nIn the earlier Middle Ages an especial interest attaches\r\nitself to the Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. Magnificent documents\r\nin themselves, they gain additional interest from\r\nbeing the first vernacular treatises of the kind in existence.\r\nThe investigator approaches them with hopes that they\r\nmay yield a harvest of Anglo-Saxon custom and folk-lore.\r\nAlas! the hope is destined to disappointment. With\r\ninsignificant exceptions the only thing English about these\r\nworks is their language. When they differ from their\r\nclassical original it is usually due to an error of the translator\r\nor the scribe, to some misarrangement of the text, or to\r\nthe introduction of some copied passage from another\r\nclassical source. Even the figures can be shown to be\r\ntaken from French or Italian documents [Figs. 59, 60, 63,\r\n64, and Plates III, IV, V].\r\n\r\nThough the figures in the manuscript herbals up to\r\nthe fifteenth century almost always correspond very closely\r\nto a fixed tradition, there are yet a very few exceptions to\r\nthis rule. Most interesting of these is a Latin manuscript\r\nwritten at Bury St. Edmunds about 1120. The majority\r\nof its figures are traditional, but others are convincing\r\nnaturalistic studies. Some monastic plant-lover had set\r\nhimself the task of preparing a book of plant pictures.\r\nHe had before him this ancient herbal, and proceeded\r\nto identify figures in it with the plants in his monastery\r\ngarden. Thus, for the 'Viperina' of the old book,\r\nhe adopted a milk thistle, Carduus marianus [Plate VI],\r\nthen a garden plant from southern Europe, where it is\r\ncommon in waste places, and now a weed of escape in\r\nBritain. Similarly, for the 'Camedrum' of the ancient\r\nherbal he took Teucrium chamaedrys [Plate VII], another\r\nsouth European and western Asiatic form, which though",
  "p188.png": "now established in parts of England is unquestionably a\r\ngarden escape. Again, for 'Paeonia' he depicted a non-British\r\nOrobus [Plate VIII]. His naturalistic drawings\r\nare a reflex of a very characteristic Anglo-Saxon form of\r\nart. That school, though very seldom occupying itself\r\nwith the plant-forms--which were usually merely copied--was\r\nvery active in his day. Unfortunately the Anglo-Saxon\r\nstyle perished soon after and naturalism in Art had\r\nto await the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAs the mediaeval centuries wore on, new influences began\r\nto affect the medical world. The most important of\r\nthese, so far as the herbals are concerned, is that which\r\ncomes from the 'Arabian' writers. This influence is indeed\r\nthe key to mediaeval science (see pp. 71-81). Islam, nowadays\r\nthe client of Christendom, was from the ninth until\r\nthe twelfth or thirteenth century the envied possessor of all\r\nthe science and philosophy then accessible, and the West\r\nhad to wrest it from her. The process led to a remarkable\r\nintellectual upheaval, the result of which is embedded\r\nin the great development known as 'Scholasticism' (see\r\npp. 85-90).\r\n\r\nThe first exponent of this Arabian influence was Constantine\r\nthe African, an adventurer who came from North\r\nAfrica, where he seems to have been in contact with Jewish\r\nphysicians. He settled at Salerno, and later became a\r\nmonk at the ancient Benedictine monastery of Monte\r\nCassino, where he spent many years translating works from\r\nArabic. He died in 1087. About a century later, in\r\n1161, one Odo, of Meune on the Loire, composed a poem\r\nabout herbs, drawing on Constantine and on certain older\r\nLatin sources. This was the first independent herbal to\r\nbe produced in the West in mediaeval times, and it became\r\none of the most popular. Odo, or his successors, attached\r\nthe name of 'Macer' to it, and it can be found in innumerable\r\nmanuscripts and printed editions, some of which are\r\nillustrated along traditional lines.\r\n\r\nAnother herbal of about the same date as 'Macer' was",

  "p189.png": "put together by the physician Mathaeus Platearius, at\r\nNaples. It is known by its opening words Circa instans.\r\nThis work relies partly on the old Latin sources, but like\r\nMacer[**in ''?] draws also on Arabian material. Platearius knew\r\nof the old dictionary of synonyms, now quite incomprehensible\r\n(p. 185), and substituted for it a series of Greek,\r\nLatin, and colloquial Italian plant names. This list is\r\nphilologically interesting as an early specimen of the Italian\r\nlanguage. The Circa instans was translated into several\r\nvernaculars and had considerable influence. It is interesting,\r\ntoo, as the prototype in the mediaeval West of a new\r\nstyle of literature, the synonyma, or dictionary of drug\r\nsynonyms. These works are occasionally illustrated and\r\nthey also approach the herbal type.\r\n\r\nThe study of plants now begins to take an upward turn.\r\n'Macer' and the Circa instans are merely literary efforts and\r\ncontain no real observation, but they herald the dawn.\r\nMore scientific is the work On plants of the great\r\nDominican, Albertus Magnus (1206-?1280). Primarily a\r\ncompilation based on a pseudo-Aristotelian work, it too is\r\nessentially a learned product. It contains, however, in\r\nplaces, evidence of careful first-hand observation. This\r\nbotanical treatise gives a very pleasing impression of the\r\ncommon-sense and open-mindedness of the great mediaeval\r\nscholar who has thus a place among the grandfathers, if\r\nnot among the fathers, of modern botany.\r\n\r\nIn the century following Albert, Conrad von Megenberg\r\n(1309-98) produced in German his Book of Nature, a complete\r\nwork on natural history and the first of its kind in\r\nthe vernacular. He has a long section devoted to plants,\r\nwhich contains some original observations, though it is\r\nfounded mainly on the work of Albert's contemporary and\r\nintimate, Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9 (1201-70), who in turn\r\nbased his work on Latin versions of ancient biological works\r\nmade from the Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe scholastic movement, to the furthering of which\r\nAlbert's chief efforts were directed, was essentially inimical",
  "p190.png": "to first-hand study, and the great scholastic centuries from\r\nthe twelfth to the fifteenth were infertile in botanical\r\nworks exhibiting any first-hand knowledge. In one department,\r\nhowever, there was some revival of the spirit of\r\nthe naturalist. The artistic spirit early showed its kinship\r\nwith the scientific by the closeness with which some illuminators\r\nof manuscripts sought to imitate nature. The\r\ntexts of the herbals remained fixed, while the illustrations,\r\neven of the older texts, underwent a definite development\r\nin the direction of increased naturalism, though still retaining\r\na traditional element.\r\n\r\nTo explain the development of illustration of the later\r\nmediaeval herbals some reference must be made to the\r\nmanner in which they were prepared. The text was\r\nusually written before the figures were inserted, and\r\nwriting and illumination were the work of different hands.\r\nThe illuminator had the advantage over the scribe in being\r\nwithout learning, for in certain stages of human development\r\nfreedom from tradition is a positive advantage. Thus\r\nthe figures are as a rule a little later and may occasionally\r\nbe much later than the text, and are not infrequently produced\r\nin a different spirit. Sometimes the provenance of\r\nthe model can be determined from an examination of the\r\nfigures. Thus in one of the figures from the Anglo-Saxon\r\nherbarium of about the year 1050, the plant representing\r\nthe henbane, or to call it by its earlier English name,\r\nhennebelle, is not our familiar Hyoscyamus niger but Hyoscyamus\r\nreticulatus, a Mediterranean form not found in this\r\ncountry [Plate V]. Again, the herbal prepared at Bury\r\nSt. Edmunds in 1120, to which we have already referred,\r\ncan be shown to reproduce a figure of a thistle that\r\ngrows in southern France [Plate VI].\r\n\r\nIt must always be remembered too that those who used\r\nthese herbals had no idea of plant distribution. The\r\nconception that flora had local peculiarities, familiar enough\r\nin antiquity, had been lost in the Middle Ages. When\r\nthe scribe copied his text he usually left a space into which",

  "p191.png": "the illustrator could then fit his figure. Many manuscript\r\nherbals are known in which the illustrator has either not\r\ncompleted or not begun his work, so that these spaces\r\nremain blank. The gaps might be filled in later, according\r\nas the owner of the book had the talent or the financial\r\nresources at his disposal. Sometimes the original model\r\nwas not available when the later figures were inserted, so\r\nthat these do not always fit the spaces left for them.\r\n\r\nSuch figures of plants being copied from earlier figures,\r\nbecame further removed from nature at each stage. But\r\nthe degradation of the copied herbarium had its limits, and\r\nthose limits were reached when the figures had so utterly\r\ndeteriorated that no semblance to an indigenous plant\r\ncould be discerned by the native scribe or owner of the\r\nbook. At this point it was necessary, if the herbal was to\r\nbe of use in practice, that there should be a return to\r\nnature so as to give some impression of a local plant. The\r\npoint of lowest illustrational degradation corresponds in\r\ngeneral to the full development of the heavy stylized\r\nmanner at the beginning of the thirteenth century\r\n[Plates IX and X]. From this period we can trace the\r\nrise towards modern methods of plant illustration. The\r\nmovement was continuous and in manuscripts of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries we can distinguish\r\nbeautiful attempts to imitate nature, comparable in their\r\ndegree to the work of the artists who employed their\r\ntalents on grander themes.\r\n\r\nAlthough some advance in herbal illustration began in\r\nthe thirteenth century, we have again the history repeated\r\nof the capacity to represent plants lagging behind other\r\nforms of art. This delay is very noticeable in the art of\r\nthe great painters. Thus the plants of Giotto (1267?-1337)\r\ncan rarely be identified, and Orcagna (1308?-68) is hardly,\r\nif at all, more easy to interpret. Even Fra Angelico\r\n(1387-1455) still belongs in this respect to the Middle\r\nAges. The first great plant painter is undoubtedly\r\nBotticelli himself (1444-1510). In the 'Birth of Venus'",

Especially good from the botanic\r\npoint of view is the beautiful cloud of flowers that falls\r\nfrom the mouth of 'Earth' in the latter great picture\r\n[Fig. 81].\r\n\r\nWith Leonardo (1452-1519) and D\u00fcrer (1471-1528) we\r\nencounter a new type. The study of the minute details of\r\nplants--botanical structure--is the strong point of the\r\nformer with his instinctive scientific bias, the rendering\r\nof plant habits one of the glories of the latter. The discussion\r\nof the works of such men as these would take us far\r\nbeyond our subject, but they are important for our purpose\r\nbecause of the repercussion of the movements which they\r\nrepresent upon the schools of manuscript illumination and\r\nso upon the herbals [Fig. 82].\r\n\r\nThe faithful rendering of minute details of nature is the\r\nspecial field of the miniature painter. This power is\r\nbeautifully brought out in many manuscripts of the later\r\nfifteenth century, and in none better illustrated than in\r\nthe famous manuscript of Bartholomaeus Anglicus (c. 1350),\r\nin the Royal Collection at the British Museum. This\r\ngrand volume was prepared at Bruges in 1482, and a large\r\npart of its text is itself of the nature of a herbal. There\r\nwas a contemporary type of manuscript too which linked\r\nitself especially with plant illustration. This was the\r\n'Book of Hours,' on which the illuminators expended\r\nmuch of their best art. One great book of hours--itself\r\none of the finest specimens of manuscript illustration in\r\nexistence--contains also a valuable example of herbal\r\nillustration. It is the document known as Les grandes\r\nheures de la Reine Anne de Bretagne, in the National Library\r\nat Paris.

Hildegard and her Works\r\n\r\nHildegard of Bingen was born in 1098, of noble parentage,\r\nat B\u00f6ckelheim, on the River Nahe, near Sponheim. Destined\r\nfrom an early age to a religious life, she passed nearly all\r\nher days within the walls of Benedictine houses. She was\r\neducated and commenced her career in the isolated convent\r\nof Disibodenberg, at the junction of the Nahe and the\r\nGlan, where she rose to be abbess. In 1147 she and some\r\nof her nuns migrated to a new convent on the Rupertsberg,\r\na finely placed site, where the smoky railway junction of\r\nBingerbr\u00fcck now mars the landscape. Between the little\r\nsettlement and the important mediaeval town of Bingen\r\nflowed the River Nahe. The stream was, and is, here spanned\r\nby a bridge of Roman origin, to which still clings the name\r\nof the pagan Drusus (15 B.C.-A.D. 19). At this spot [Fig.\r\n93], a place of ancient memories, secluded and yet linked\r\nto the world, our abbess passed the main portion of her\r\nlife, and here she closed her eyes in the eighty-second year\r\nof her age on September 17, 1179.\r\n\r\nHildegard was a woman of extraordinarily active and\r\nindependent mind. She was not only gifted with a",
  "p200.png": "thoroughly efficient intellect, but was possessed of great\r\nenergy and considerable literary power, and her writings\r\ncover a wide range, betraying the most varied activities\r\nand remarkable imaginative faculty. The most interesting\r\nof her works are her books of visions. She was before\r\nall things an ecstatic, and both of her great mystical works,\r\nthe Scivias (written between 1141 and 1150), and the\r\n\r\nFig. 93.--The Hildegard country.",
  "p201.png": "Liber divinorum operum simplicis hominis (written between\r\n1163 and 1170), contain passages of real power and beauty.\r\nLess valuable is her third long mystical work (the second in\r\npoint of time), the Liber vitae meritorum (written between\r\n1158 and 1162). She wrote an interesting mystery-play\r\nand is perhaps responsible for a collection of musical compositions,\r\nwhile her life of St. Disibode, the Irish missionary\r\n(594-674) to whom her part of the Rhineland owes its\r\nChristianity, and her account of St. Rupert, a local saint\r\ncommemorated in the name 'Rupertsberg,' bear witness to\r\nher narrative powers, to her capacity for systematic arrangement,\r\nand to her historical interests. Her extensive correspondence\r\ndemonstrates the influence that she wielded,\r\nwhile certain other works by her give us glimpses of her\r\nactivities as head of a religious house.\r\n\r\nHer biographer, the monk Theodoric, records that she\r\nalso busied herself with the treatment of the sick and credits\r\nher with miraculous powers of healing. Some of the\r\ncited instances of this faculty, as the curing of a love-sick\r\nmaid, are but manifestations of personal ascendancy over\r\nweaker minds. Notwithstanding her undoubted acquaintance\r\nwith such feeble remains of ancient science as existed\r\nin her day, and notwithstanding the claims that have been\r\nmade for her as a pioneer of the hospital system, there\r\nis no serious evidence that her treatment extended beyond\r\nexorcism and prayer. There is a medical compilation\r\nascribed to her, which is an interesting relic of Dark Age\r\nmedicine. We are, however, unconvinced by the evidence\r\nthat Hildegard was its authoress.\r\n\r\nFor her time and circumstance Hildegard saw a fair\r\namount of the world. Living on the Rhine, the highway of\r\nWestern Germany, she was well placed for observing the\r\ntraffics and activities of men. She had journeyed as far\r\nnorth as Cologne, and had traversed the eastern tributary\r\nof the great river to Frankfort on the Main and to Rothenburg\r\non the Taube. Her own country, the basin of the\r\nNahe and the Glan, she knew intimately. She was in",
  "p202.png": "constant communication with Mayence, the seat of the\r\narchbishopric in which Bingen was situated, and there\r\nhas survived an extensive correspondence with the ecclesiastics\r\nof Cologne, Speyer, Hildesheim, Treves, Bamberg,\r\nPrague, N\u00fcrenberg, Utrecht, and numerous other towns\r\nof Germany, the Low Countries, and Central Europe.\r\n\r\nHildegard's journeys, undertaken with the object of\r\nstimulating spiritual revival, were of the nature of religious\r\nprogresses. Like those of her contemporary, St. Bernard of\r\nClairvaux, they were in fact largely directed against the\r\nheretical and most cruelly persecuted Cathari, an Albigensian\r\nsect widely spread in the Rhine country of the twelfth\r\ncentury. In justice to her memory it is to be recalled that\r\nshe herself was ever against the shedding of blood. It was\r\nnot an age of tolerance, but had her less ferocious views\r\nprevailed, some more substantial relic than the groans and\r\ntears of this people might have reached our time, while the\r\nannals of the Church would have been spared the defilement\r\nof an indelible stain.\r\n\r\nHildegard's correspondence with St. Bernard, then\r\npreaching his crusade, with four popes, Eugenius III,\r\nAnastasius IV, Adrian IV, and Alexander III, and with the\r\nemperors Conrad and Frederic Barbarossa, brings her into\r\nthe current of general European history. She comes into\r\nsome slight contact with the story of England by her hortatory\r\nletters to Henry II and his consort Eleanor, the divorced\r\nwife of Louis VII.\r\n\r\nTo complete a sketch of her literary activities, mention\r\nshould be made of a secret script and language attributed\r\nto her. It is a foolishly empty device that hardly merits\r\nthe dignity of the term 'mystical.' It has, however,\r\nexercised the ingenuity of several learned philologists.\r\n\r\nThere is ample material for a full biography of Hildegard,\r\nand many accounts have appeared of her. Most of them\r\nare the work of men devoid of critical judgement and are\r\nmarked by a desire for edification that neither adds to their\r\nattractiveness as literature nor conduces to our assurance",

It would demand more skill than\r\nher biographers have exhibited to interest a detached reader\r\nin the minutiae of monastic disputes that absorbed a considerable\r\npart of her activities. Perhaps the best life of\r\nher is the earliest. It is certainly neither the most credulous\r\nnor the worst written and is by her contemporaries, the\r\nmonks Godefrid and Theodoric.\r\n\r\nHildegard was never canonized. Attempts towards that\r\nend were made under the Popes Gregory IX (1237), Innocent\r\nIV (1243), and John XXII (1317). Miraculous cures\r\nand other works of wonder were claimed for her, but either\r\nthey were insufficiently miraculous or insufficiently attested.\r\nThose who have impartially traced her life in her documents\r\nwill, we believe, agree with the verdict of the Church.\r\nHers was a fiery, a prophetic, in many ways a singularly\r\nnoble spirit, but she exhibited defects of character which\r\nprevent us from regarding her as a woman of truly saintly\r\nmind or life. From her doctrine of Nous (p. 217) the\r\northodox may derive evidence of her heresy as an author\r\nand the pious draw comfort for her failure to achieve\r\ncanonization as a saint.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to interpret the views of Hildegard on\r\nscientific subjects, certain special difficulties present themselves.\r\nFirst is the confusion arising from the writings\r\nto which her name has been erroneously attached. From\r\nthe discussion which follows we omit certain works ascribed\r\nto her on what seem to us inadequate grounds. A second\r\ndifficulty is due to the receptivity of her mind, so that views\r\nand theories that she accepts in her earlier works become\r\nmodified, altered, and developed in her later writings. A\r\nthird difficulty, perhaps less real than the others, is the\r\nvisionary and involved form in which her thoughts are\r\ncast. But a fourth and more vital difficulty is the attitude\r\nthat she adopts towards phenomena in general. To this\r\ndifficulty we must devote a little special attention.\r\n\r\nTo Hildegard's mind there is no distinction between\r\nphysical events, moral truths, and spiritual experiences.",
  "p204.png": "This view, which our children share with their mediaeval\r\nancestors, was developed but not transformed by her\r\nvisionary powers. Her fusion of internal and external\r\nuniverse links Hildegard to a whole series of mediaeval\r\nvisionaries, culminating with Dante. In Hildegard, as in\r\nher fellow-mystics, we find that ideas on Nature and Man,\r\nthe Moral World and the Material Universe, the Spheres,\r\nthe Winds and the Humours, Birth and Death, on the\r\nSoul, the Resurrection of the Dead, and the Nature of God,\r\nare not only interdependent but closely interwoven. Nowadays\r\nwe separate our ideas into categories, scientific, ethical,\r\ntheological, philosophical, and so forth, and we even esteem\r\nit a virtue to retain and restrain our thoughts within limits\r\nthat we deliberately set for them. To Hildegard the segregation\r\nof ideas in this manner would have been incomprehensible.\r\nSuch terms as parallelism or allegory do not\r\ncover her views of the relation of the material and spiritual.\r\nIn her mind the material and spiritual are really interfused,\r\nor rather they have not yet been separated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, although in the following pages an attempt\r\nis made to estimate her scientific views, yet this method must,\r\nof its nature, interpret her thought only in a very partial\r\nfashion. Hildegard presents to us scientific thought as an\r\nundifferentiated factor, and an attempt is here made to\r\nseparate it, by the artificial but not unscientific process of\r\ndissection, from the organic matrix in which it is embedded.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the works of Hildegard is greatly heightened\r\nby the existence of certain early and most remarkably\r\nilluminated manuscripts of her visions. Some knowledge\r\nof the miniatures in two of these, one at Wiesbaden and one\r\nat Lucca, is essential for the understanding of her meaning.\r\n\r\nThe illuminated manuscript of Hildegard's Scivias in\r\nthe provincial library at Wiesbaden is a truly noble\r\nvolume, in excellent preservation and of the highest value\r\nfor the history of mediaeval art. It was prepared in or\r\nnear Bingen at about the time of Hildegard's death. Its\r\nminiatures help greatly in the interpretation of the visions,",

In view of\r\nthe great difficulty in visualizing much of her narrative, there\r\ncan be little doubt that the preparation of these miniatures\r\nwas either supervised by the prophetess herself or under\r\nher immediate tradition [Frontispiece, Plates XI-XIV, Figs.\r\n95, 97-9, 107-9]\r\n\r\nThe other important illuminated manuscript of Hildegard\r\nis that of the Liber divinorum operum simplicis hominis in\r\nthe municipal library at Lucca. It was written very\r\nearly in the thirteenth century. Of its most remarkable\r\nminiatures, some are of special value for the interpretation\r\nof Hildegard's theories on the relation of Macrocosm and\r\nMicrocosm, of which more hereafter. They represent\r\nthe meaning of the text with a convincing sureness of touch.\r\nWithout the clues provided by the Lucca miniatures, many\r\npassages in the book would be wholly incomprehensible.\r\nIt is probable that the traditional interpretation of Hildegard's\r\nworks, thus preserved to our time by these miniatures\r\nand by them alone, had its origin from the mouth of the\r\nprophetess herself [Plate II, Figs. 94 and 101-3].\r\n\r\nWe have here to consider especially Hildegard's view of\r\nthe material world, the scientific contents of her visions.\r\nThese are all grouped round her theory of the macrocosm\r\nand microcosm. It will be convenient to consider her\r\nviews under four heads. Firstly, her conception of the\r\nstructure of the Universe, the Macrocosm (\u00a7 2). Secondly,\r\nthe doctrine of the relation of Macrocosm and Microcosm\r\n(\u00a7 3). Thirdly, her view of the structure of the body of\r\nMan, the Microcosm (\u00a7 4). Fourthly, her view of the\r\nnature of the soul (\u00a7 5).\r\n\r\n\u00a7 2. Hildegard's View of the Universe the Macrocosm\r\n\r\nTo the student of mediaeval science Hildegard's beliefs\r\nas to the nature and structure of the universe are among the\r\nmost interesting that she has to impart, and here the miniatures\r\naid us greatly.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of Hildegard's universe is a spherical earth.",

In\r\nmost mediaeval works, as for instance in Dante (p. 86),\r\nthe universe is, however, described as spherical. The egg-*",
  "p207.png": "*shape, as exhibited by Hildegard, is unusual, but is encountered\r\namong other mediaeval writers. Many of the\r\nso-called Mappaemundi exhibit the surface of the habitable\r\nearth itself as oval, and it was probably from the misunderstanding\r\nof such charts that Hildegard and other writers\r\ngained their conception of an oval universe. In her method\r\nof orientation also she follows the Mappaemundi, placing\r\nthe east at the top of the page, where we are accustomed to\r\nplace the north.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that Hildegard does not deal with\r\ngeography in the restricted sense, and so we are not in full\r\npossession of her views on the antipodes, a subject of derision\r\nto patristic and of misconception to scholastic writers.\r\nShe does, however, vaguely refer to the inversion of seasons\r\nand climates in the opposite hemisphere, though she\r\nconfuses the issue by the adoption of a theory, widespread\r\nin the Middle Ages and reproduced in the Divina Commedia,\r\nthat the antipodean surface of the earth is uninhabitable,\r\nsince it is either beneath the ocean or in the mouth of the\r\nDragon [Fig. 94]. The nature of the antipodean inversion\r\nof climates was clearly grasped by her contemporary,\r\nHerrade de Landsberg [Fig. 96].\r\n\r\nHildegard's views as to the internal structure of the terrestrial\r\nsphere are more difficult to follow. Her doctrine of\r\nPurgatory and Hell is confused, but she held that the interior\r\nof the earth contained two vast spaces, shaped like truncated\r\ncones, where punishment was meted out and whence many\r\nevil things had issue. Her whole scheme presents analogies\r\nas well as contrasts to that of her kindred spirit Dante [Fig.\r\n95 and cf. Fig. 39]. Hildegard, however, who died before\r\nthe thirteenth century had dawned, presents us with a\r\nscheme far less definite and elaborated than that of her\r\ngreat successor, who had all the stores of the golden age of\r\nscholasticism on which to draw.\r\n\r\nIn Hildegard's first diagram of the universe, which is of\r\nthe nature of a 'section,' the world, the sphaera elementorum\r\nof mediaeval writers, is diagrammatically represented as",

In the outer part",

The long axis of this, as of the\r\nremaining outer shells, is in the direction from east to west,\r\nthus determining the path of movement of the heavenly\r\nbodies. Scattered through the purus aether are the constellations\r\nof the fixed stars and arranged along the long axis\r\nare the moon and the two inner planets. From this zone\r\nblows the west wind. The position and constitution of this\r\npurus aether is evidently the result of some misinterpretation\r\nof Aristotelian writings.\r\n\r\nThe next zone, the umbrosa pellis or ignis niger, is a\r\nnarrow dark shell, whence proceed the more dramatic\r\nmeteorological events. Here, following on the hints of the\r\nWisdom of Solomon (chap. v) and the Book of Job (chap.\r\nxxxviii), are situated the diagrammatically portrayed\r\ntreasuries of lightning and of hail. From here the tempestuous\r\nnorth wind bursts forth. The presence of this ignis\r\nniger suggests some contact on the part of the authoress\r\nwith the teaching of the Meteorologica of Aristotle. The\r\nnature of this contact we shall consider later.\r\n\r\nThe outermost layer of all is a mass of flames, the lucidus\r\nignis. Here are the sun and the three outer planets, and\r\nfrom here the south wind pours its scorching breath [Fig. 95].\r\n\r\nThe movements of the four outer zones around each other,\r\ncarrying the heavenly bodies with them, are attributed to\r\nthe winds in each zone. The seasonal variations in the\r\nmovements of the heavenly bodies, along with the recurring\r\nseasons themselves, are also determined by the prevalent\r\nwinds, which, acting as the motive-power upon the various\r\nzones, form a celestial parallelogram of forces. In this way is\r\nexplained also why in spring the days lengthen and in autumn\r\nthey shorten, until in either case an equinox is reached.\r\n\r\n'I looked and behold the east and the south wind with their collaterals,\r\nmoving the firmament by the power of their breath, caused",
  "p210.png": "it to revolve over the earth from east to west; and in the same way the\r\nwest and north wind and their collaterals, receiving the impulse and\r\nprojecting their blast, thrust it back again from west to east....'\r\n\r\n'I saw also that as the days began to lengthen, the south wind and\r\nhis collaterals gradually raised the firmament in the southern zone upwards\r\ntowards the north, until the days ceased to grow longer. Then,\r\nwhen the days began to shorten, the north wind with his collaterals,\r\nshrinking from the brightness of the sun, drove the firmament back\r\ngradually southward until by reason of the lengthening days the south\r\nwind began yet again to raise it up.'[1] [Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\nIntimately bound up not only with her theory of the\r\nnature and structure of the universe but also with her\r\nbeliefs as to the end of things is Hildegard's doctrine of the\r\nelements. Before the Fall of Man these were arranged\r\nin a harmony, which was disturbed by that catastrophe\r\n[Fig. 98], so that they have since remained in the state of\r\nmingled confusion in which we always encounter them on\r\nthe terrestrial globe. This mistio, to use the mediaeval\r\nAristotelian term, is symbolized by the irregular manner in\r\nwhich the elements are represented in the central sphere of\r\nthe diagram of the universe [Fig. 95]. Thus mingled\r\nthey will remain until subjected to the melting-pot of the\r\nLast Judgement [Fig. 97], when they will emerge in a new\r\nand eternal harmony, no longer mixed as matter, but\r\nseparate and pure, parts of the new heaven and the new\r\nearth [Fig. 99].\r\n\r\n'But the heavens and the earth which are now ... are kept in\r\nstore and reserved unto fire against the day of judgement and perdition\r\nof ungodly men.... But the day of the Lord will come  ... in\r\nthe which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements\r\nshall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that\r\nare therein shall be burned up.... Nevertheless we, according to\r\nhis promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth\r\nrighteousness.' (2 Peter iii, 7, 10, and 12.)\r\n\r\nSo Hildegard, acting on a scriptural hint, is enabled to\r\ndematerialize her doctrine of the after-things.\r\n\r\nBut, although since man's fall the elements have lost their\r\n\r\n1 Migne, cols. 789-91.",

These are\r\nthe 'superior elements' which still retain some at least of\r\ntheir individuality and primal purity. From each of their\r\nspheres blows, as we have seen, one of the cardinal winds,\r\nand each wind partakes of the elemental character of the\r\nzone whence it issues, and has a corresponding influence\r\non man's body, since each of the four humours is specifically\r\naffected by the element to which it corresponds.\r\n\r\n'Then I saw that by the diverse quality of the winds, and of the\r\natmosphere as they in turn sweep through it, the humours in man are\r\nagitated and altered. For in each of the superior elements there is a\r\nbreath of corresponding quality by which, through the power of the\r\nwinds, the corresponding element (below) is forced to revolve in the\r\natmosphere, and in no other way is it moved. And by one of those\r\nwinds, with the agency of sun, moon and stars, the atmosphere which\r\ntempers the world is breathed forth.'[1] [Cf. Fig. 101.]\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of the relation of the various winds to the\r\nfour elements and through them to the four humours is\r\nfound in the De Rerum Natura of Isidore of Seville, and is\r\nillustrated in European manuscripts from the ninth century\r\nonward, but we meet it set forth with special definiteness\r\nin the twelfth century in the translations from Messahalah\r\n(p. 236). It is encountered also in the work of Herrade de\r\nLandsberg (p. 237). In and after the thirteenth century it\r\nhad become a common-place.\r\n\r\nThe description we have given of the universe was set\r\nforth by Hildegard in her first mystical work, the Scivias\r\n(1141-50). Subsequently she became dissatisfied with the\r\naccount she had given and, while not withdrawing it, she\r\nsought in her later Liber Divinorum Operum (1163-70) so\r\nto modify the original presentment as to bring it more\r\n\r\n1 Migne, col. 791.",

Thus she writes:\r\n\r\n'There appeared to me in vision a disk very like that object which\r\nI saw twenty-eight years ago of the form of an egg, in the third vision\r\nof my book Scivias. In the outer part of the disk there was as it were\r\nthe lucidus ignis, and beneath it the circle of the ignis niger was portrayed\r\n... and these two circles were so joined as to be one circle.'\r\n\r\nThere was thus one outer zone representing the fire.\r\n\r\n'Under the circle of the ignis niger there was another circle in the\r\nlikeness of the purus aether which was of the same width as the two\r\nconjoined (outer) fiery circles. And below this circle again was the\r\ncircle of the aer aquosus as wide as the lucidus ignis. And below this\r\ncircle was yet another circle, the fortis et albus lucidusque aer ... the\r\nwidth whereof was as the width of the ignis niger, and these circles were\r\njoined to make one circle which was thus again of width equal to the\r\nouter two. Again, under this last circle yet another circle, the aer\r\ntenuis, was distinguishable, which could be seen to raise itself as a cloud,\r\nsometimes high and light, sometimes depressed and dark, and to diffuse\r\nitself as it were throughout the whole disk.... The outermost fiery\r\ncircle perfuses the other circles with its fire, while the watery circle\r\nsaturates them with its moisture (cf. Wisdom of Solomon xix. 18-20).\r\nAnd from the extreme eastern part of the disk to the extreme west a\r\nline is stretched out (i.e. the equator) which separates the northern\r\nzones from the others.'[1] [Fig. 100, Plate II, and Figs. 101, 103.]\r\n\r\nThe earth lies concentrically with the aer tenuis and its\r\nmeasurements are given thus:\r\n\r\n'In the midst of the aer tenuis a globe was indicated, the circumference\r\nof which was everywhere equidistant from the fortis et albus\r\nlucidusque aer, and it was as far across as the depth of the space from\r\nthe top of the highest circle to the extremity of the clouds, or from\r\nthe extremity of the clouds to the circumference of the inner globe.'[2]\r\n[Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\nIn her earlier work, the Scivias, Hildegard apparently had\r\nnot realized the need of accounting for the independent\r\nmovements of the planets other than the sun and moon.\r\nShe had thus placed the moon and two of the moving stars\r\nin the purus aether, and the sun and the three remaining\r\n\r\n1 Migne, cols. 403-14.\r\n\r\n2 Migne, col. 751.",

They\r\nreveal our prophetess attempting to revise much of her\r\nearlier theory of the universe. Note that (a) the universe has\r\nbecome round; (b) there is an attempt to arrange the zones\r\naccording to their density, i.e. from without inwards, fire,\r\nair (ether), water, earth; (c) exact measurements are given;\r\n(d) the water zone is continued earthward so as to mingle\r\nwith the central circle. In all these and other respects she\r\nhas adapted her opinions to the general current of mediaeval\r\nscience which was just beginning to be moulded by Aristotelian\r\nworks translated from the Arabic. Her knowledge\r\nof the movements of the heavenly bodies is entirely innocent\r\nof the doctrine of epicycles, but in other respects her views\r\nhave come to resemble those, for instance, of Messahalah,\r\none of the simplest and easiest writers on the sphere.\r\nFurthermore, her conceptions have developed so as to fit in\r\nwith the macrocosm-microcosm scheme which she grasped\r\nabout the year 1158.

Her conceptions were however disturbed by the\r\nawkward facts that water penetrated below the earth, and\r\nindeed sought the lowest level, while air and not water lay\r\nimmediately above the earth's surface. Mediaeval writers\r\nadopted various devices and expended a vast amount of ingenuity\r\nin dealing with this obvious discrepancy.

Both writers\r\nattach a far greater demonstrative value to analogy than we\r\nnow allow, and the reasoning of both is almost exclusively\r\na priori. The vast stress on analogy and the constant use of\r\na priori methods are the two chief elements which separate\r\nthe scientific thought of the Middle Ages from that of our\r\nown time.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 3. Hildegard's Theory of the Relation of Macrocosm\r\nand Microcosm\r\n\r\nThe winds and elements of the outer universe, the\r\nMacrocosm, become in Hildegard's later schemes intimately\r\nrelated to structures and events within the body of man\r\nhimself, the Microcosm, the being around whom the universe\r\ncentres. The terms macrocosm and microcosm are not employed\r\nby her, but, in her last great work, the Liber Divinorum\r\nOperum, she succeeds, in most eloquent and able fashion,\r\nin synthesizing into one great whole, centred around this\r\ndoctrine, her theological beliefs and her physiological\r\nknowledge, together with her conceptions of the working of\r\nthe human mind and of the structure of the universe. The\r\nwork is thus an epitome of the science of the time viewed,\r\nhowever, through the distorting medium of this theory.\r\nIn studying it the modern reader is necessarily hampered\r\nby the bizarre and visionary form into which the whole\r\nsubject is cast. Nevertheless, the scheme, though complex\r\nand difficult, is neither incoherent nor insane, as at first\r\nsight it may seem. It is, in fact, a highly systematic and\r\nskilful presentment of a cosmic theory which for centuries\r\ndominated scientific thought.\r\n\r\nAs an explanation of the complexity of existence which\r\nthinkers of all ages have sought to bring within the range of\r\nsome simple formula, this theory of the essential similarity\r\nof macrocosm and microcosm held in the Middle Ages,\r\nduring the Renaissance and even into quite modern times,",

If at times it passed into folly, fantasy,\r\nand even madness, it should be remembered that it also\r\nfulfilled a high purpose. It gave a significance to the facts of\r\nnature and a formula to the naturalist, it unified philosophic\r\nsystems, it exercised the ingenuity of theologians, and furnished\r\na convenient framework to prophecy, while it seemed\r\nto illumine history and to provide a key and meaning to\r\nlife itself. Even now it is not perhaps wholly devoid of\r\nmessage, but as a phenomenon in the history of human\r\nthought, a theory which appealed to such diverse scientific\r\nwriters as Seneca, Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus, William\r\nGilbert, William Harvey, Robert Boyle, and Leibnitz is\r\nsurely worthy of attention. We may turn now to Hildegard's\r\npresentation of this doctrine.\r\n\r\nHildegard's Liber Divinorum Operum opens with a remarkable\r\nand beautiful vision illustrated by a no less remarkable\r\npicture [Fig. 102]:\r\n\r\n'I saw a fair human form and the countenance thereof was of such\r\nbeauty and brightness that it had been easier to gaze upon the sun.\r\nThe head thereof was girt with a golden circlet through which appeared\r\nanother face as of an aged man. From the neck of the figure on either\r\nside sprang a pinion which swept upward above the circlet and joined\r\nits fellow on high. And where on the right the wing turned upward,\r\nwas portrayed an eagle's head with eyes of flame, wherein appeared, as in\r\na mirror, the lightning of the angels, while from a man's head in the\r\nother wing the lightning of the stars did radiate. From either shoulder\r\nanother wing reached to the knees. The figure was robed in brightness\r\nof the sun, while the hands held a lamb shining with light. Beneath,\r\nthe feet trampled a horrible black monster of revolting shape, upon the\r\nright ear of which a writhing serpent fixed itself.'[1]\r\n\r\nThe image declares its identity in words reminiscent\r\nof the Wisdom literature or of passages in the Hermetic\r\nwritings, but which are, in fact, partly borrowed from\r\nBernard Sylvester (see pp. 230 and 237).\r\n\r\n'I am that supreme and fiery force that sends forth all the sparks\r\nof life.

I am life.'[1]\r\n\r\nHildegard thus supposes that the whole universe is\r\npermeated by a single living spirit, the figure of the vision.\r\nThis spirit of the macrocosm [Fig. 102], the Nous or 'world\r\nspirit' of Hermetic and Neoplatonic literature, the impersonated\r\nNature, as we may perhaps render it, is in its turn\r\ncontrolled by the Godhead that pervades the form and is\r\nrepresented rising from its vertex as a second human face.\r\nNature, the spirit of the cosmic order, controls and holds\r\nin subjection the hideous monster, the principle of death\r\nand dissolution, the Hyle or primordial matter of the Neoplatonists\r\nwhose chaotic and anarchic force would shatter\r\nand destroy this fair world unless fettered by a higher power.\r\n\r\nWith the details of the visionary figure we need not delay,[2]\r\nbut we pass to the description of the structure of the macrocosm\r\nitself, to which the second vision is devoted [Fig. 103].\r\nHere appears the same figure of the macrocosmic spirit.\r\nBut now the head and feet only are visible, and the arms\r\nare outstretched to enclose the disk of the universe which\r\nconceals the body.

It is illustrated\r\nby a charming miniature in the Lucca manuscript\r\n[Plate II].\r\n\r\n'I saw that the upper fiery firmament was stirred, so that as it were\r\nashes were cast therefrom to earth, and they produced rashes and ulcers\r\nin men and animals and fruits.'\r\n\r\nThese effects are shown in the left upper quadrant\r\nof Plate II, where the ashes are seen proceeding from\r\nthe lucidus ignis, the 'upper fiery firmament.'

On\r\nthe legs of the latter a rash may be distinguished.\r\n\r\n'And looking again I saw that from the fortis et albus lucidusque aer\r\ncertain other clouds reached the earth and infected men and beasts with\r\nsore pestilence, so that they were subjected to many ills even to the\r\ndeath, but the aer aquosus opposed that influence so that they were no[**not?]\r\nhurt beyond measure.'",

The influence of the 'Melothesia'--to give it the\r\nname assigned by Porphyry--has been traced through its\r\nperiod of efflorescence at the Renaissance [Fig. 38] right\r\ndown to our own age and country, where it still appeals\r\nto the ignorant and foolish, and is still to be found in\r\npopular calendars and prophecies.\r\n\r\nHildegard often interprets natural events by means of a\r\npeculiarly crude form of the doctrine of the parallelism of\r\nMacrocosm and Microcosm. Thus she tells us that 'if\r\nthe excess of waters below are drawn up to the clouds (by\r\nthe judgement of God in the requital of sinners), then the\r\nmoisture from the aer aquosus transudes through the fortis\r\net albus lucidusque aer as a draught drunk transudes into\r\nthe urinary bladder; and the same waters descend in an\r\ninundation.'[1]\r\n\r\nAgain, events in the body of man are most naively explained\r\non the basis of the nature of the external world as\r\nshe has pictured it.\r\n\r\n'The humours at times rage fiercely as a leopard and again they are\r\nsoftened, going backwards as a crab; or they may show their diversity\r\nby leaping and goring as a stag, or they may be as a wolf in their ravening,\r\nand yet again they may invade the body of man after the manner of both\r\nwolf and crab. Or else they may show forth their strength unceasingly\r\nas a lion, or as a serpent they may go now softly, now violently, and at\r\ntimes they may be gentle as a lamb and at times again they may growl\r\nas an angered bear, and at times they may partake of the nature of the\r\nlamb and of the serpent.'[2] These animals will be seen represented in\r\nPlate II and in Figs. 101 and 103.\r\n\r\nThe word cancer is here used, but the crab goes sideways,\r\nnot backwards.

Trithemius, the teacher of Paracelsus, was abbot\r\nof Sponheim, an important settlement almost within sight\r\nof Hildegard's convents on the Rupertsberg and Disibodenberg.\r\nTrithemius studied Hildegard's writings with great\r\ncare and attached much importance to them, so that they\r\nmay well have influenced his pupil.\r\n\r\nThe influence of mediaeval theories of the relation of\r\nMacrocosm and Microcosm is encountered among numerous\r\nRenaissance writers beside Paracelsus. But as knowledge\r\naccumulated, the difficulty in applying the details of the\r\ntheory became ever greater. Facts were strained and\r\nmutilated more and more to make them fit the Procrustean\r\nbed of an outworn theory, which became\r\nuntenable when the heliocentric system of Copernicus,\r\nKepler, and Galileo replaced the geocentric and anthropocentric\r\nsystems of an earlier age. The idea of a close\r\nparallelism between the structure of man and of the wider\r\nuniverse was gradually abandoned by the scientific, while\r\namong the unscientific it degenerated and became little\r\nbetter than an insane obsession. As such it appears in the\r\ningenious ravings of the English follower of Paracelsus, the\r\nRosicrucian, Robert Fludd, who reproduced, often with\r\nfidelity, the systems which had some novelty five centuries\r\nbefore his time.

A perusal of them reduces her sources of information\r\nto three. One of these was the book On the Nature of\r\nMan by Constantine the African (died 1087. See p. 75).\r\nThis book was translated by him about 1085, at the Benedictine\r\nAbbey of Monte Cassino, from some unknown\r\nArabic original. The other anatomical work to which\r\nHildegard was able to refer was a series of five diagrams\r\nrepresenting respectively the arteries, veins, bones, nerves,\r\nand muscles [Fig. 104]. These diagrams were very widespread\r\nduring the Middle Ages and were copied in the most\r\nservile fashion for centuries. Her account of the structure\r\nof the body was also in part derived from the work of Hugh\r\nof St. Victor On the Members and Parts of Man.

The resultant is a curious visionary system of\r\nanatomy, physiology, and pathology, which we set forth in\r\nan abbreviated translation:--\r\n\r\n'The humours may pass to the liver, where wisdom is tested, having\r\nbeen already tempered in the brain by the strength of the spirit, and\r\nhaving absorbed its moisture so that now it is plump, strong, and healthy.\r\n\r\n'In the right of man is the liver and its great heat, so that the right\r\nis swift to act and to work[1] ... the vessels of the liver, affected by\r\nthe agitation of the humours, trouble the venules of the ear of man and\r\nsometimes confound the organ of hearing....\r\n\r\n'I saw also that sometimes the humours seek the navel, which\r\ncovers the viscera as a cap, and holds them in, lest they be dissipated,\r\n\r\n1 An idea that occurs in Aristotle, Parts of Animals, ii, c. 2, but is rejected\r\nby Galen.",

  "p225.png": "and maintains their course and preserves the heat both of them and of\r\nthe veins....\r\n\r\n'And the same humours go to the vessels of the reins and of other\r\nmembers, and pass in their turn to the vessels of the spleen, and then\r\nto the lungs and to the heart; and they meet the viscera on the left\r\nwhere they are warmed by the lungs, but the liver warms the right-hand\r\nside of the body. And the vessels of the brain, heart, lung, liver,\r\nand other parts carry strength to the reins, whose vessels descend to\r\nthe legs, strengthening them; and returning along with the leg\r\nvessels, they unite with the virile organ or with the womb as the case\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n'Again, the muscles of the arms, legs, and thighs contain vessels full\r\nof humours; and just as the belly has within it viscera containing\r\nnourishment, so the muscles of arms, legs, and thighs have both vessels\r\nand the (contained) humours which preserve man's strength.... But\r\nwhen a man runs or walks quickly, the nerves about the knees and the\r\nvenules in the knees become distended. And since they are united\r\nwith the vessels of the legs, which are numerous and intercommunicated\r\nin a net-like manner, they conduct the fatigue to the vessels of the liver,\r\nand thus they reach the vessels of the brain, and so send the fatigue\r\nthroughout the body.\r\n\r\n'The humours in man are distributed in just measure. But when\r\nthey affect the veins of the liver, his humidity is decreased and also\r\nthe humidity of the chest is attenuated; so that thus dried, he falls\r\ninto disease of such a nature that the phlegm is dry and toxic and ascends\r\nto the brain. There it produces headache and pain in the eyes and\r\nwasting of the marrow, and thus if the moon is in default he may develop\r\nthe falling evil (epilepsy).\r\n\r\n'The humidity also which is in the umbilicus is dispersed by the\r\nsame humours, and turned into dryness and hardness, so that the\r\nflesh becomes ulcerated and scabby as though he were leprous, if indeed\r\nhe do not actually become so. And the vessels of his testicles, being\r\nadversely affected by these humours, are dried up within them; and thus,\r\nthe humours being withdrawn, impetigos may arise ... and the\r\nmarrow of the bones and the vessels of the flesh are dried up, and so the\r\nman becomes chronically ill, dragging out his days in languor.\r\n\r\n'But sometimes the humours so affect breast and liver ... that\r\nvarious foolish thoughts arise ... and they ascend to the brain and\r\ninfect it and again descend to the stomach and generate fevers there, so\r\nthat the man is long sick. Yet again they vex the minor vessels of the\r\near with superfluity of phlegm; or with the same phlegm they infect\r\nthe vessels of the lung, so that he coughs and can scarce breathe and\r\nthe phlegm may pass thence into the vessels of the heart and give",

Thus the following\r\npassage on the relationship of the planets to the brain is\r\nwell illustrated by a diagram of Herrade de Landsberg.\r\n\r\n'From the summit of the vessel of the brain to the extremity of the\r\nforehead seven equal spaces can be distinguished. Here the seven\r\nplanets are designated, the uppermost planet in the highest part, the\r\nmoon in front, the sun in the middle, and the other planets distributed\r\namong the other spaces' [Fig. 105].\r\n\r\n\u00a7 5. Birth and Death and the Nature of the Soul\r\n\r\nThe method by which the soul enters the body is set\r\nforth in a very striking vision in the Scivias and is illustrated\r\nin the Wiesbaden Codex by a no less remarkable\r\nminiature [Fig. 106]. The soul, which contains the element\r\nof wisdom, passes into the infant's body, while yet\r\nwithin the mother's womb. The Wisdom of God is represented\r\nas a four-square object, with its angles set to the\r\nfour quarters of the earth, this form being the symbol of\r\nstability. From it a long tube-like process descends into\r\nthe mother's womb. Down this there passes into the\r\nchild a bright object, described variously as 'spherical'\r\nand as 'shapeless,' which 'illumines the whole body,'\r\nand becomes or develops into the soul.\r\n\r\nThe birth scene is strikingly portrayed. In the foreground\r\nlies the mother with the head and shoulders supported and\r\nthe right arm raised. In her womb is the infant in the\r\nposition known to obstetricians as a 'transverse presentation.'\r\nAround the child may be distinguished clear traces\r\nof the uterine membranes. Near the couch are ranged a\r\ngroup of ten figures who carry vessels containing the various\r\nqualities of the child. Above and to the left the Evil One\r\nmay be seen pouring some noxious substance into one of\r\n\r\n1 Migne, cols. 792-3.",

Over\r\nthe head of the figure are written the names of the seven planets. Air and fire stand\r\none on each side. The inscription against the head may be rendered: 'The head of\r\nthe microcosm is round like the heavenly sphere. In it are two eyes as the two\r\nluminaries shine in the heavens and there are seven orifices adorn it like the seven\r\nheavens of harmony.' Against the thorax is written: 'In the chest is breath and\r\ncough like to winds and thunder.' Against the abdomen: 'Into the belly all things\r\nflow like rivers to the sea.' By the legs stand the emblems of Earth and Water and the\r\nanalogy is similarly carried on.",

Some was of the thick kind from which\r\nfirm cheese is made, some of the thinner sort from which more porous\r\n[tenuis] cheese is made, and some was mixed with corruption [tabes] and\r\nof the sort from which bitter cheese is made. And I saw the likeness\r\nof a woman having a complete human form within her womb. And\r\nthen, by a secret disposition of the Most High Craftsman, a fiery sphere\r\nhaving none of the lineaments of a human body possessed the heart\r\nof the form, and reached the brain and transfused itself through all the\r\nmembers....\r\n\r\n'And I saw that many circling eddies possessed the sphere and\r\nbrought it earthward, but with ever renewed force it returned upward\r\nand with wailing asked, \"I, wanderer that I am, where am I?\" \"In\r\ndeath's shadow.\" \"And where go I?\" \"In the way of sinners.\"\r\n\"And what is my hope?\" \"That of all wanderers.\"'[1]\r\n\r\nThe vision is then further explained as follows:\r\n\r\n'Those whom thou seest carrying milk in earthen vessels are in\r\nthe world, men and women alike, having in their bodies the seed\r\nof mankind from which are procreated the various kinds of human\r\nbeings. Part is thickened because the seed in its strength is well\r\nand truly concocted, and this produces forceful men to whom are\r\nallotted gifts both spiritual and carnal.... And some had cheeses\r\nless firmly curdled, for they in their feebleness have seen imperfectly\r\ntempered, and they raise offspring mostly stupid, feeble, and useless....\r\nAnd some was mixed with corruption ... for the seed in that\r\nbrew cannot be rightly raised, it is invalid and makes misshapen men\r\nwho are bitter, distressed, and oppressed of heart, so that they may not\r\nlift their gaze to higher things.[2]... And often in forgetfulness\r\nof God and by the mocking devil, a mistio is made of the man and of\r\nthe woman, and the thing born therefrom is deformed, for parents who\r\nhave sinned against me return to me crucified in their children.'[3]\r\n[Compare Constantine, De humana natura, sections 'De perfectione'\r\nand 'De impeditione.']\r\n\r\nHildegard thus supposes that the qualities and form of a\r\nchild are inherited from its parents, but that two factors,\r\nthe formless soul from the Almighty and the corrupt fluid\r\n\r\n1 Migne, col. 415.\r\n\r\n2 Migne, col. 421.\r\n\r\n3 Migne, col. 424.",

This is the usual mediaeval view and is broadly\r\nportrayed in the figure.\r\n\r\nThe strange conception of the body being formed from\r\nthe seed as cheese is precipitated and curdled from milk,\r\nis doubtless derived from a passage in the Book of Job:\r\n\r\nHast thou not poured me out as milk,\r\nAnd curdled me like cheese?\r\nThou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,\r\nAnd knit me together with bones and sinews.[1] (Job x. 10, 11.)\r\n\r\nWhen the body has thus taken shape there enters into it\r\nthe soul, which, though at first shapeless, gradually assumes\r\nthe form of its host, the earthly tabernacle; and at death\r\nthe soul departs through the mouth with the last breath, as\r\na fully developed naked human shape, to be received by\r\ndevils or angels as the case may be [Fig. 107].\r\n\r\nDuring its residence in the body the soul plays the part\r\nusually assigned to it in the earlier mediaeval psychology.\r\nHildegard regards the brain as having three chambers or\r\ndivisions, corresponding to the three parts of man's nature,\r\nan idea encountered in the writings of St. Augustine.\r\nParallel to these there are, she tells us:\r\n\r\n'three elements in man by which he shows life; to wit, soul (anima),\r\nbody (corpus), and sense (sensus). The soul vivifies the body and inspires\r\nthe senses; the body attracts the soul and reveals the senses; the senses\r\naffect the soul and allure the body. For the soul rules the body as a\r\nflame throws light into darkness, and it has two principal powers or limbs,\r\nthe intellect (intellectus) and the will (voluntas).... For the intellect\r\nis attached to the soul as the arms to the body; for as the body is prolonged\r\ninto arms with fingers and hands attached, so the intellect is\r\nproduced from the soul by the operations of its various powers.'[2]\r\n\r\nWe need follow Hildegard no further into her maze of\r\nmicro-cosmology, in which an essential similarity and\r\n\r\n1 The Aristotelian writings also compare the transformation of the\r\nmaterial humours into the child's body with the solidification of milk in\r\nthe formation of cheese.\r\n\r\n2 Migne, col. 425.",

The Pathological Basis of the Visions\r\n\r\nFor the physical accompaniments and phenomena of\r\nHildegard's visions we have three separate lines of evidence:\r\nher own account; the statements of her contemporary\r\nbiographers, Theodoric and Godefrid; and the miniatures\r\nof the Wiesbaden Codex, probably prepared under her\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that despite the length and activity of her life\r\nHildegard did not enjoy normal health. From a very early\r\nage she was the subject of trances and visions, and from time\r\nto time she was prostrated with protracted illness.\r\n\r\n'God punished me for a time by laying me on a bed of sickness so that\r\nthe blood was dried in my veins, the moisture in my flesh, and the marrow\r\nin my bones, as though the spirit were about to depart from my body.\r\nIn this affliction I lay thirty days while my body burned as with fever, and\r\nit was thought that this sickness was laid upon me for a punishment. And\r\nmy spirit also was ailing, and yet was pinned to my flesh, so that while I\r\ndid not die, yet did I not altogether live. And throughout those days\r\nI watched a procession of angels innumerable who fought with Michael\r\nand against the Dragon and won the victory.... And one of them called\r\nout to me, \"Eagle, Eagle,[2] why sleepest thou?... All the eagles are\r\nwatching thee.... Arise! for it is dawn, and eat and drink\".... And\r\nthen the whole troop cried out with a mighty voice ... \"Is not the\r\ntime for passing come? Arise, maiden, arise!\" Instantly my body and\r\nmy senses came back into the world; and seeing this, my daughters who\r\nwere weeping around me lifted me from the ground and placed me on my\r\nbed, and thus I began to get back my strength.\r\n\r\n'But the affliction laid upon me did not fully cease; yet was my\r\nspirit daily strengthened.... I was yet weak of flesh, timid of mind,\r\nand fearful of pain ... but in my soul I said, \"Lord, Lord, all that\r\n\r\n1 Especially in the Liber Divinorum Operum, pars 1[**1 or I?], vis. iv.\r\n\r\n2 The eagle is frequently in mediaeval writings a symbol of the power\r\nof Divine Grace.",

Thus was my body\r\nseethed as in a pot ... yet gave I thanks to God, for if this affliction had\r\nnot been from Him I had surely not lived so long. But although I was\r\nthus tortured, yet did I, in supernal vision, often repeat, cry aloud, and\r\nwrite those things which the Holy Spirit willed to put before me.'\r\n\r\n'Three years were thus passed during which the Cherubim thus\r\npursued me with a flaming sword ... and at length my spirit revived\r\nwithin me and my body was restored again as to its veins and marrows,\r\nand thus I was healed.'[2]\r\n\r\nThis illness of Hildegard was the longest and most\r\ntypical but by no means the only one through which she\r\npassed. She describes her affliction as continuing for long\r\nperiods, but there can be little doubt, from her history,\r\nthat during much of the time she was able to carry on some\r\nat least of her functions as head of a religious house.\r\n\r\nThe condition from which she was suffering was clearly\r\na functional nervous disorder; this is sufficiently demonstrated\r\nby her repeated complete recoveries, her activity\r\nbetween the attacks, and the great age to which she lived.\r\nAt first sight the long procession of figures and visions\r\nsuggests that she might have been the victim of a condition\r\nsimilar to that of which Jerome Cardan has left us so complete\r\na personal record. But on reading the books of visions\r\nthe reader will easily convince himself that we are not here\r\ndealing with a dream-state. The visions are indeed essentially\r\nvivid. 'These visions which I saw,' she repeatedly\r\nassures us, 'I beheld neither in sleep, nor in dream, nor in\r\nmadness, nor with my carnal eyes, nor with the ears of the\r\nflesh, nor in hidden places; but wakeful, alert, with the\r\neyes of the spirit and with the inward ears, I perceived them\r\nin open view and according to the will of God. And how\r\nthis was compassed is hard indeed for human flesh to\r\nsearch out.'[3]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though the visions exhibit great originality\r\nand creative power--the reader will often be reminded of\r\n\r\n1 Migne, col. 110.\r\n\r\n2 Migne, col. 111.\r\n\r\n3 Migne, col. 384.",
  "p232.png": "William Blake--all or nearly all present certain characters\r\nin common. In all a prominent feature is a point or a group\r\nof points of light, which shimmer and move, usually in a\r\nwavelike manner, and are most often interpreted as stars or\r\nflaming eyes [Frontispiece]. In quite a number of cases\r\none light, larger than the rest, exhibits a series of concentric\r\ncircular figures of wavering form [Plate XI]; and often\r\ndefinite fortification figures are described, radiating in\r\nsome cases from a coloured area [Plates XII, XIII]. Often\r\nthe lights gave that impression of working, boiling, or fermenting,\r\ndescribed by so many visionaries, from Ezekiel\r\nonwards.\r\n\r\nThis outline of the visions Hildegard herself variously\r\ninterpreted. We give examples from the more typical of\r\nthese visions, in which the medical reader or the sufferer\r\nfrom migraine will, we think, easily recognize the symptoms\r\nof 'scintillating scotoma.' Some of the illuminations, here\r\nreproduced in their original colours, will confirm this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n'I saw a great star most splendid and beautiful, and with it an exceeding\r\nmultitude of falling sparks which with the star followed southward. And\r\nthey examined Him upon His throne almost as something hostile, and\r\nturning from Him they sought rather the north. And suddenly they\r\nwere all annihilated, being turned into black coals ... and cast into the\r\nabyss that I could see them no more.'[1] [Frontispiece.]\r\n\r\nThis vision, illustrated by the beautiful figure of stars\r\nfalling into the waves, is interpreted by her as signifying\r\nthe Fall of the Angels.\r\n\r\nThe concentric circles appear in numerous visions, and\r\nnotably in that of the Days of the Creation of the World and\r\nthe Fall of Man, illustrated by what is perhaps the most\r\nbeautiful of all the miniatures of the Wiesbaden Codex\r\n[Fig. 108]. It is in this concentric form that Hildegard\r\nmost frequently pictures the Almighty, and the idea again\r\nappears in the eleventh miniature, here reproduced in its\r\noriginal colours, which she describes as 'a most shining light\r\n\r\n1 Scivias, lib. iii, vis. 1; Migne, col. 565.",

Appearances of this type are recorded again\r\nand again.\r\n\r\nThe type with fortification figures is encountered in a\r\nwhole series of visions, of which we reproduce the account\r\nand illumination of the Zelus Dei [Plate XIII, and Sedens\r\nLucidus, Plate XII].\r\n\r\n'I looked and behold, a head of marvellous form ... of the colour\r\nof flame and red as fire, and it had a terrible human face gazing northward\r\nin great wrath. From the neck downward I could see no further form,\r\nfor the body was altogether concealed ... but the head itself I saw,\r\nlike the bare form of a human head. Nor was it hairy like a man, nor\r\nindeed after the manner of a woman, but it was more like to a man than\r\na woman, and very awful to look upon.\r\n\r\n'It had three wings of marvellous length and breadth, white as a\r\ndazzling cloud. They were not raised erect but spread apart one from\r\nthe other, and the head rose slightly above them ... and at times they\r\nwould beat terribly and again would be still. No word uttered the head,\r\nbut remained altogether still, yet now and again beating with its extended\r\nwings.'\r\n\r\nFrom the head extended a series of fortification lines, and\r\nthis peculiar form of vision is reproduced on several occasions\r\nand variously interpreted [Plate XIII]. It is united\r\nwith similar visions in what we regard as a reconstructed\r\nconception of exceedingly complex structure. This she\r\nclaims to see separately, and she interprets it as the\r\naedificium of the city of God [Plate XIV]. Such reconstructed\r\nvisions are clearly of a different type and origin to\r\nthe simple group in which a shining light or group of lights\r\nis encountered and interpreted as a speaking figure.\r\n\r\nHildegard's visions, perhaps without exception, contain\r\nthis element of a blinding or glittering light, which she interprets\r\nin a more or less spiritual manner. We terminate our\r\naccount with the passage in which she sums up her experiences\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n'From my infancy,' she says, 'up to the present time, I being now more\r\nthan seventy years of age, I have always seen this light in my spirit and",
  "p234.png": "not with external eyes, nor with any thoughts of my heart nor with help\r\nfrom the senses. But my outward eyes remain open and the other corporeal\r\nsenses retain their activity. The light which I see is not located\r\nbut yet is more brilliant than the sun, nor can I examine its height, length,\r\nor breadth, and I name it the \"cloud of the living light.\" And as sun,\r\nmoon, and stars are reflected in water, so the writings, sayings, virtues, and\r\nworks of men shine in it before me. And whatever I thus see in vision\r\nthe memory thereof remains long with me. Likewise I see, hear, and\r\nunderstand almost in a moment and I set down what I thus learn....\r\n\r\n'But sometimes I behold within this light another light which I name\r\n\"the Living Light itself\".... And when I look upon it every sadness\r\nand pain vanishes from my memory, so that I am again as a simple maid\r\nand not as an old woman.[1]\r\n\r\n'And now that I am over seventy years old my spirit, according to the\r\nwill of God, soars upward in vision to the highest heaven and to the farthest\r\nstretch of the air and spreads itself among different peoples to regions\r\nexceeding far from me here, and thence I can behold the changing clouds\r\nand the mutations of all created things; for all these I see not with the\r\noutward eye or ear, nor do I create them from the cogitations of my heart\r\n... but within my spirit, my eyes being open, so that I have never suffered\r\nany terror when they left me.'[2]\r\n\r\n\u00a7 7. Sources of Hildegard's Scientific Knowledge\r\n\r\nIn our discussion we have often referred to works consulted\r\nby Hildegard. In this section we have to consider\r\nher sources in more general terms. Her imaginative power\r\nand mystical tendency make an exhaustive search into the\r\norigin of her ideas a difficult task. Unfortunately, she does\r\nnot herself refer to any of her sources other than the Biblical\r\nbooks; to have cited profane writers would have involved\r\nthe abandonment of her claim that her knowledge was\r\nderived by immediate inspiration from on high. Nevertheless,\r\nit is possible to form some idea, on internal evidence,\r\nof the origin of many of her scientific conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe most striking point concerning the sources of Hildegard's\r\nmystical writings is negative. There is no German\r\nlinguistic element distinguishable, and the writings show\r\nlittle or no trace of native German folk-lore. She claims\r\nto be a simple unlearned woman, unskilled in the Latin\r\ntongue; but with the testimony before us of the writings\r\n\r\n1 Migne, col. 18.\r\n\r\n2 Migne, col. 18.",
  "p235.png": "themselves, and of her use of Latin, the statement may be\r\nset down to a mere literary formula, accentuated by the\r\ndesire to magnify the element of inspiration. So far from\r\nher having been illiterate, we perceive that not only the form--which\r\nmight have been modified by a contemporary\r\neditor--but also the structure and details of her writings\r\nbetray much painstaking study of the works of others.\r\n\r\nHildegard lived at rather too early a date to drink fully at\r\nthat broad stream of new knowledge that was soon to flow\r\ninto Europe through Paris from its reservoir in Moslem\r\nSpain. Such drops from that source as may have reached\r\nher must have trickled in either from Italy, with the works\r\nof Constantine the African (died 1087), or perhaps from the\r\nJews who had settled in the Upper Rhineland.\r\n\r\nHer science is primarily of the usual degenerate Greek\r\ntype, of the earlier Middle Ages. We may distinguish in\r\nit disintegrated fragments of Aristotle and Galen, coloured\r\nand altered by the customary mediaeval attempts to bring\r\ntheory into line with scriptural phraseology, though a\r\ndegree of independence is at times obtained by the visionary\r\nform in which her views are set. Hildegard exhibits, like\r\nall mediaeval writers on science, the Aristotelian theory of\r\nthe elements, but her statement of the doctrine is illuminated\r\nby flashes of her own thoughts and is coloured\r\nby suggestions from St. Augustine, Isidore of Seville,\r\nBernard Sylvester, and from writings attributed to\r\nBoethius.\r\n\r\nThe great translator from the Arabic, Gerard of Cremona\r\n(1114-87), was her contemporary, and his labours at\r\nToledo made available for Latin readers a vast number of\r\nscientific works which had previously circulated only among\r\nArabic-speaking peoples. Several of these works, notably\r\nMessahalah's De Orbe, and the Aristotelian De Caelo et\r\nMundo, and parts of the Meteorologica, which contain\r\nmaterial on the form of the Universe and on the nature of the\r\nelements, evidently reached the Rhineland in time to be\r\nused by Hildegard. On the subject of the form of the earth",
  "p236.png": "Hildegard expressed herself definitely as a spherist, a point\r\nof view more widely accepted in the earlier Middle Ages\r\nthan is perhaps generally supposed. She considers in the\r\nusual mediaeval fashion that this globe of ours is surrounded\r\nby celestial spheres that influence terrestrial events. But\r\nwhile she claims that human affairs are controlled, under\r\nGod, by the heavenly cosmos, she yet commits herself to\r\nnone of that more detailed astrological doctrine that was\r\ndeveloping in her time, and came to efflorescence in the\r\nfollowing centuries. In this respect she follows the earlier\r\nand more scientific spirit of such writers as Messahalah,\r\nrather than the wilder theories of her own age. The shortness\r\nand simplicity of Messahalah's tract on the sphere made\r\nit very popular. It was one of the earliest to be translated\r\ninto Latin; and its contents would account for the change\r\nwhich, as we shall see, came over Hildegard's scientific\r\nviews in her later years.\r\n\r\nThe general conception of the universe as a series of\r\nconcentric elemental spheres had penetrated to Western\r\nEurope centuries before Hildegard's time. Nevertheless,\r\nthe prophetess presents it to her audience as a new and\r\nstriking revelation. There is another favourite mediaeval\r\ncosmic theory, however, which she developed along individual\r\nlines. Hildegard exhibits in a peculiar and original\r\nform the doctrine of the macrocosm and microcosm (see\r\npp. 224-6). Hardly distinguishable in the Scivias (1141-50),\r\nit appears definitely in the Liber Vitae Meritorum (1158-62),\r\nin which work, however, it takes no very prominent place,\r\nand is largely overlaid and concealed by other lines of thought.\r\nBut in the Liber Divinorum Operum (1163-70) this belief\r\nis the main theme. The book is indeed an elaborate attempt\r\nto demonstrate a similarity and relationship between the\r\nnature of the Godhead, the constitution of the universe,\r\nand the structure of man, and it thus forms a valuable compendium\r\nof the science of the day viewed from the standpoint\r\nof this theory.\r\n\r\nFrom whence did she derive the theory of macrocosm",
  "p237.png": "and microcosm? In outline its elements were easily accessible\r\nto her in Isidore's De Rerum Natura. But the work\r\nof Bernard Sylvester, De mundi universitate sive megacosmus\r\net microcosmus, corresponds so closely both in form, in\r\nspirit, and sometimes even in phraseology to the Liber\r\nDivinorum Operum, that Hildegard must have had access\r\nto it. Bernard's work can be dated between the years\r\n1145-53. This would correspond well with the appearance\r\nof his doctrines in the Liber Vitae Meritorum (1158-62)\r\nand their full development in the Liber Divinorum Operum\r\n(1163-70).\r\n\r\nAnother older contemporary with whom Hildegard\r\npresents points of contact is the mystical writer Hugh of\r\nSaxony (1096-1141), head of the monastic school of St.\r\nVictor at Paris. In Hugh's writings the doctrine of the\r\nrelation of macrocosm and microcosm is more veiled than\r\nwith Bernard Sylvester. Nevertheless, the symbolic universe\r\nin his work The Mystic Noah's Ark is on the lines\r\nof Hildegard's belief, and presents many parallels to the\r\nvisions of Hildegard.\r\n\r\nAt Hildegard's date very complex cabalistic systems involving\r\nthe doctrine of macrocosm and microcosm were\r\nbeing elaborated by the Jews, and Rabbinic mysticism\r\nspecially flourished in her district. The famous traveller\r\nBenjamin of Tudela, who visited Bingen during Hildegard's\r\nlifetime, tells us that he found there a congregation\r\nof his people. It is clear from her writings that she was\r\nfamiliar with Jews, and it is possible that she may have\r\nderived some of the very complex macrocosmic conceptions,\r\nwith which her last work is crowded, from local Jewish\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThe Alsatian Abbess, Herrade de Landsberg (died 1195),\r\na contemporary of Hildegard, developed the microcosm\r\ntheory along similar lines. A combination of circumstances\r\nthus make it probable that the theory, in the form in which\r\nthese writers present it, reached the Upper Rhineland somewhere\r\nabout the middle or latter half of the twelfth century,",
  "p238.png": "and that it was conveyed by works coloured by Neoplatonism\r\nand depending on Arabic sources.\r\n\r\nApart from the Biblical books, the work which made the\r\ndeepest impression on Hildegard was Augustine's City of\r\nGod, which forms the background of a large part of the\r\nScivias. Ezekiel, Daniel, and the Apocalypse among the\r\nBiblical books, the Gospel of Nicodemus and the Shepherd of\r\nHermas among Apocryphal books, contain a lurid type of\r\nvision which her own spiritual experiences enabled her\r\nto utilize, and which fitted in well with her microcosmic\r\ndoctrines. Ideas on the harmony and disharmony of the\r\nelements she picked up from the Wisdom of Solomon and\r\nfrom the Pauline writings, supplemented by Isidore of\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\nHer figure of the Church in the Scivias reminds us irresistibly\r\nof Boethius' vision of the gracious feminine form of\r\nPhilosophy, and Boethius was very widely read in Hildegard's\r\nday. The visions of the punishments of Hell which\r\nHildegard recounts in the Liber Vitae Meritorum bear\r\nresemblance to the work of her contemporary Benedictine,\r\nthe monk Alberic the younger of Monte Cassino (1101-c. 1160),\r\nto whom Dante also became indebted.\r\n\r\nHildegard repeatedly assures us that most of her knowledge\r\nwas revealed to her in waking visions. Some of these,\r\nwe have seen, had a pathological basis and she was a sufferer\r\nfrom a condition that would nowadays probably be classified\r\nas hystero-epilepsy. Too much stress, however, can easily\r\nbe laid on the ecstatic presentment of her scientific views.\r\nVisions, it must be remembered, were a common literary\r\ndevice at the period. Her contemporary Benedictine sister,\r\nElizabeth of Sch\u00f6nau, as well as numerous successors, as for\r\nexample Gertrude of Robersdorf, adopted the same framework\r\nfor their message. The use of the vision for this\r\npurpose remained popular for centuries, and we may say\r\nof these writers, as of Dante, that the visions gave, not the\r\ngenius nor the poetic inspiration, but the form merely in\r\nwhich they were realized.",

Introduction\r\n\r\nThe earliest European institution to develop an organization\r\nthat bore a semblance to a university is said to have been the\r\nmedical school at Salerno, an ancient seaport in southern\r\nItaly not far from Naples. For centuries the Byzantine\r\nEmpire, securely ensconced on the Adriatic sea-board,\r\ndisputed the mastery of southern Italy with native chiefs,\r\nand, from the eighth century onwards, with Saracens\r\nalso. The prevailing language of the South remained,\r\neven into modern times, a dialect of Greek. The imperfect\r\ngrasp of the Byzantines, however, gave an opportunity for\r\nthe entrance of other tongues. A Latin speech of a peculiar\r\nsouthern type was spoken in many places; in others\r\nGreek was replaced by some form of Arabic speech. Nor\r\nwere Latin, Greek, and Saracen cultures the only competitors.\r\nMaterial and literary remains combine to tell us of\r\na considerable development of a Jewish culture in this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nInto this welter of futile and static archaism, of linguistic\r\nand cultural strife, three great solvent forces entered.\r\nFirst came the stimulus of Moslem energy and enterprise.\r\nSecondly, there was the Norman invasion and conquest,\r\nwith the resulting reorganization of society and the strengthening\r\nof law. Thirdly, there was Jewish learning and",
  "p241.png": "the Jewish habit of syncretizing. The finished product\r\nof these forces at Salerno was the first medical school in\r\nEurope which flourished in the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies. But in 1224 a university was formally instituted\r\nat Naples by the Emperor Frederick II. This measure\r\nwas fatal to the neighbouring school, and the importance\r\nof Salerno immediately began to wane, although the\r\nliterary activity of the place continued to some extent,\r\nand the school prolonged a progressively more feeble\r\nexistence to the beginning of the nineteenth century. It\r\ngradually became a place of 'bogus degrees.' When\r\nNapoleon closed it in 1811, it was but a corpse that he slew.\r\n\r\nAs with all established things, legends had gathered round\r\nthe Salernitan School. All ancient institutions tend to\r\ndevelop such stories to account for their origin. The\r\nschool of Salerno, as we may more than suspect, was never\r\nreally 'founded' at all, rather it 'just growed.' It was a\r\nnatural product of certain very peculiar and complex\r\ncultural surroundings. To follow all its legends would be\r\nquite beyond our purpose; we shall, however, discuss\r\nfour, of peculiar interest and of peculiar persistence.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 2. The Four Masters\r\n\r\nThe first of our legends relates that 'the school of Salerno\r\nwas founded by four masters, a Greek, a Latin, an Arab,\r\nand a Jew.' A book is in existence actually fathered on\r\nthese 'four masters.' Their historicity was credited until\r\nquite modern times, and is assumed in the works of several\r\nliving historians, though it is generally scouted by critical\r\nwriters. Yet the idea of the foundation of the school by\r\na Greek, a Latin, an Arab, and a Jew, though not literally\r\ntrue, does correspond, as we have seen, to the mingled\r\ninfluences under which the school arose. Can we associate\r\nit with any historical individual? The names mentioned\r\nin the legend have not been traced back to any real personages.\r\nBut there is an historical personage who seems to\r\nunite the four masters in himself, and seems to typify",
  "p242.png": "in his own person the influences under which the school\r\nof Salerno arose. This is the Jew Donnolo.\r\n\r\nThe name Donnolo is but a variation of Domnulus, a\r\ndiminutive of Dominus, and his full name was Shabbethai\r\nben Abraham ben Joel. He was born near Otranto in 913,\r\nand he died there about 984. His life course therefore\r\ncorresponds to the period which just precedes the time when\r\nour records of the medical school of Salerno begin. He\r\nrepresents the legendary stratum. When he was twelve\r\nyears of age, Donnolo and his family were captured by\r\nMoslem raiders, and carried off to Palermo, which had\r\nlong been under Moslem rule. While a Saracen prisoner\r\nDonnolo made his first acquaintance with the Arabic\r\nlanguage. After a time he was ransomed by relatives and\r\nreturned to Otranto, and later he practised medicine there\r\nand at Rossano. A considerable fragment has survived\r\nof a medical treatise by him. At Otranto Donnolo managed\r\nto secure a teacher of Arabic from Baghdad. The fact\r\nthat he was able to do so bears witness to the mixed character\r\nof the population of South Italy at that date. He learned\r\nfrom him the wisdom of the East: he afterwards claimed to\r\nhave 'studied all the sciences of the Greeks, Arabs, Babylonians,\r\nand Indians.'\r\n\r\nThis hankering after Eastern learning may seem a strange\r\nthing to us, but we must recall the circumstances of the\r\ntimes. During the centuries between the eighth and\r\ntwelfth, the hegemony of the philosophical and scientific\r\nworld, as of the world of arms and affairs, lay not with\r\nChristendom but with Islam, whose sway extended athwart\r\nthe world from India to the Atlantic [Fig. 32]. Teeming\r\nwith intellectual activity, this great stretch of lands became\r\nunited not only by a religion but also by a language. From\r\nAndalusia to Persia the tongue of the Koran was used for\r\nthe purpose of learning and philosophy, and mediaeval\r\nIslam thus enjoyed an advantage never attained by any\r\ncivilization of like extent. In such a civilization there\r\nhad naturally grown up a portentous accumulation of",
  "p243.png": "scientific and medical works. These were based on the\r\nheritage of Greek science that Islam had received from\r\nancient Greece, mainly through Syriac sources. In this\r\ngreat Arabic literature advances had been made in some\r\ndepartments, notably in mathematics, though in most\r\ndepartments, as in medicine, the Arabian material was a\r\ndeterioration from the best Greek standards. Such as it\r\nwas, however, it was the most effective and most living\r\nthen available. It was material of this sort that Donnolo\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nDonnolo's medical work is written in Hebrew, but in a\r\npeculiar Hebrew that contains many Arabic idioms and a\r\nfew Arabic words. The basis of the treatment detailed in\r\nit is in many respects that usual in the Arabic medical works\r\nof ultimate Greek origin. Of some of the herbs he mentions\r\nhe gives the Greek form, of others the Latin form--in both\r\ncases transliterated into Hebrew. We know, too, both\r\nfrom his own statements and from those of his contemporary\r\nSt. Nilus of Rossano, that Donnolo had travelled among\r\nthe Latins.\r\n\r\nHave we not therefore here a very personification of the\r\nfirst legend of Salerno? It is untrue that the school was\r\nfounded by a Greek, a Latin, an Arab, and a Jew; but it\r\nis true that the four influences that those names represent\r\nwere at work in South Italy in the tenth century. We\r\nfind an individual in South Italy practising the art of medicine\r\nand exhibiting the influence of all four cultures in his\r\nwritings. As in so many cases, therefore, we may discern\r\nan element of truth at the back of the legend, and may treat\r\nit, like many other legends, as but \"history misunderstood.\"\r\nIt is these four cultural influences, Greek, Latin, Hebrew,\r\nand Arabic, that we see being welded together as the first\r\nuniversity in Europe emerges into the light of historic day.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 3. 'The Ladies of Salerne'\r\n\r\nThe second legend is that of the 'ladies of Salerne.' The\r\nclaim has often been maintained that Salerno was quite",
  "p244.png": "unique among mediaeval institutions in the free way in which\r\nboth women and Jews were admitted to its teaching, even\r\nin the early period. Alas! as regards the 'ladies of Salerne'\r\nat least, the cold light of history dissipates the romantic\r\nstory! There, as elsewhere in the earlier Middle Ages,\r\nwomen doubtless acted as midwives and nurses, and to\r\nthis extent they may have been connected with the medical\r\nschool. But the works to which their names have been\r\nconnected with such assurance, where are they? Let us\r\nglance at the answer.\r\n\r\nA lady of Salerno, known as Trotula, whose life course\r\nis placed in the earlier eleventh century, is said to have been\r\nthe authoress of the only two books by Salernitan women\r\nthat the ages have spared to us. Her name passed long\r\nago into the fairy-tales as Dame Trot, and has been known\r\nin every nursery for four hundred years. Alas! she had\r\nno real existence. The treatises by the so-called Trotula\r\nare in fact compilations from sources far more ancient\r\nthan the Middle or even the Dark Ages. The very name\r\nTrotula is due to a misunderstanding. One Trottus,\r\nindeed, there was, a doctor of Salerno, and a mere male.\r\nHis works, or rather his compilations, were spoken of as\r\nthe Trotula, according to a common habit of the Italian\r\nschools. As these works happened to deal with aspects\r\nof women's life and contained something of the 'Peeping\r\nTom' about them, they were naturally mothered on a\r\nwoman. The situation is not devoid of humour--and thus\r\nfades into nothingness the first woman professor whose\r\nlife a learned medical historian once essayed to write![1]\r\n\r\n\u00a7 4. The Falsifications of Constantine the African\r\n\r\nWe now turn to shatter the reputation of the most\r\nconsiderable and most influential writer that the school of\r\nSalerno has produced, Constantinus Afer. The 'High\r\nSalernitan' period, when the fame of the medical school\r\n\r\n1 Salvatore De Renzi, Collectio Salernitana, 5 vols. (Naples, 1852-8), i.\r\n149-61.",
  "p245.png": "was at its height, is inaugurated by the works of Constantine\r\nthe African, of Salerno and Monte Cassino, a Christian\r\nconvert from Islam, who died in 1087. He is an historical\r\ncharacter right enough, and we now have a considerable\r\namount of information about him, most of it by no means\r\nto his credit.\r\n\r\nThe works that bear Constantine's name are all, in\r\nfact, versions of the compositions of Greek medical writers,\r\nbut they are neither translated from the Greek nor are they\r\ntraditional South Italian material. Some of them he had\r\ntranslated from Arabic writers, altering them considerably\r\nfor the worse in the process; of others he gives us the\r\nnames of the authors, but he gives them falsely! Many\r\nother confusions are to be found in these works of Constantine.\r\nSome of these errors, it is evident, were deliberately\r\nintroduced, with the intention of deceiving. The wiles\r\nof Constantine have occupied the attention and exercised\r\nthe ingenuity of scholars for generations. We are now in\r\nthe happy position of being able to unmask him. The\r\nwriter on whom Constantine mainly leaned was Abu\r\nJakub Ishak ben Suleiman al Israeli (died 953), an excellent\r\nand respectable Jewish physician who practised in the\r\ntenth century, first in Egypt and later in Kairouan, and\r\nwrote voluminous Arabic works. He was known to the\r\nLatin West as Isaac Judaeus. The further details of the\r\nliterary depredations of Constantine need not occupy us, for\r\nthey have been expounded in detail by that most learned\r\nof Orientalists, Moritz Steinschneider.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 5. Salerno and the King of England\r\n\r\nThere is yet a fourth legend of Salerno, however, with\r\nwhich we must deal faithfully. The most popular medical\r\nwork ever written is the Regimen Sanitatis Salerni. It has\r\nbeen translated into nearly every European and some\r\nAsiatic languages. It has run into hundreds of editions.\r\nVerses of it are still repeated by herbalists in every country,\r\nand it forms the basis of much medical folk-lore. It is a",
  "p246.png": "series of verses of mediaeval origin, the received text\r\nbeginning with the line Anglorum regi scribit Schola tota\r\nSalerni. This long poem was admirably Englished by Sir\r\nJohn Harrington in the seventeenth century. The introduction\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Salerne Schoole doth by these lines impart\r\nAll health to Englands King, and doth advise\r\nFrom care his head to keepe, from wrath his heart,\r\nDrink not much wine, sup light, and soone arise.\r\nWhen meat is gone, long sitting breedeth smart;\r\nAnd after-noone still waking keep your eyes.\r\nWhen mov'd you find your selfe to Natures Needs\r\nForbeare them not, for that much danger breeds.\r\nUse three Physicions still; first Doctor Quiet,\r\nNext Doctor Merry-man, and Doctor Dyet.\r\n\r\nThe advice is doubtless admirable. More scepticism may\r\nbe expressed as to the identity of this English king than as\r\nto the wisdom of the restraint urged upon him. We are\r\nfirmly of the opinion that he is another historical Mrs.\r\n'Arris, fit mate for Trotula herself. Some of the MSS.\r\nspeak of him as 'Robert.' The older editions--and an undue\r\nproportion of the modern ones--identify him with Robert\r\nDuke of Normandy (1054?-1134), the eldest son of William\r\nthe Conqueror. On his way back from the Crusade the\r\ngraceless Robert sojourned a while at Salerno in the years\r\n1099-1100, to be healed of a wound. His stay in the 'Hippocratic\r\ncity' is said to have cost him the English crown. It\r\ncertainly cost him another wound, that of love, for it was\r\nthere that he fell a victim to the charms of the lady that he\r\nmarried. The ascription of the poem to Robert would\r\nrefer the work to about the year 1100, and it is usually so\r\ndated. This view, however, is untenable.\r\n\r\nThe Salernitan poem, in the form at present recognized,\r\nwas certainly put together at a much later date than 1100,\r\nand in the period of Salernitan decline. Manuscripts of it\r\nare very common, but the earliest known in its present form\r\nis from the beginning of the fourteenth century, and in the",
  "p247.png": "recension of the Catalan, Arnald of Villanova (1238?-1311,\r\npp. 94-5). Arnald was a strange combination of charlatan\r\nand genius, who had himself studied at Salerno. He is\r\nunder strong suspicion--to say the least of it--of having\r\nconcocted practically the whole thing himself. As for the\r\nascription to the King of England, it would be completely\r\nin the manner of the time to inset this as a recommendation\r\nof the poem to the reader. Some manuscripts of it are, in\r\nfact, dedicated to the 'King of Arragon,' others to the\r\n'King of the Franks,' and others to Charlemagne himself.\r\nIn these circumstances it is scarcely worth the scholar's\r\nwhile to spend time in the identification of this particular\r\nking of England. In the Middle Ages, as now, medicine\r\ngood enough for the great was held to be more than good\r\nenough for the small. The word of an eminent actress or\r\ncricketer is held by our advertisements to justify the use\r\nof a nerve tonic, a pill, or an ointment. So it was also in the\r\nMiddle Ages, though the contemporary idea of greatness\r\ndiffered somewhat from ours. After all, these manuscripts\r\nhad to be sold, and what better way than to attach a king's\r\nname to them? So passes our fourth legend!\r\n\r\nBut as the legend of Dame Trot still rejoices the nursery,\r\nso does that of the Regimen still console the kitchen and\r\nthe cottage. The pen of that poet whose name is legion has\r\nbeen busy with the Salernitan verses. One of his best\r\nand best-known efforts has been exerted on the introduction\r\nto Duke Robert. That passage contains the exquisite\r\nlines,\r\n\r\nSi tibi deficiant medici, medici tibi fiant\r\nHaec tria, mens laeta, requies, moderata diaeta.\r\n\r\nThese the unknown poet has thus immortalized,\r\n\r\nJoy, Temperance, and Repose\r\nSlam the door on the doctor's nose.\r\n\r\nClassical scholars have assured us that Virgil's tomb\r\nis none the worse for never having seen the bones of",

We, on\r\nour side, may at least claim that medical advice is certainly\r\nnone the worse for never having been given to Duke Robert.\r\nHistory permits us to hear little good of that scapegrace,\r\nbut his remedies will be none the worse--and none the\r\nbetter--for that!
