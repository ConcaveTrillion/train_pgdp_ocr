(\"Courteous,\" \"Intelligent,\" \"Patient,\" and\r\n\"Worshipful,\" as readers were addressed by authors\r\nwhilom), presuming you to possess the estimable qualities\r\nimplied by such designations, I have less timidity in asking\r\nyour indulgence while travelling with me through the following\r\nchapters on weird and fanciful delusions.\r\n\r\nPossibly your patience will be tried by predilections of my\r\nown for particular subjects, which may not prove so attractive\r\nto you as they have been pleasant to myself. It is, also, more\r\nthan probable that there are omissions, which have been rendered\r\ninevitable by the confined compass of this book. But I trust\r\nfor your forbearance, inasmuch as I have, perhaps, spared you\r\na long and wearisome perusal of time-worn books on occult\r\nlore, that may have long slumbered, neglected, on their shelves,\r\nand the study of which may not be recreative to general\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Of what use is the exposure of the dark side\r\nof human nature,--the weaknesses and follies of mankind?\r\nWere these matters of the past only, we might be contented\r\nwith smiling at the ignorance and fatuity of our ancestors, but\r\nthe inheritance of many strange and flimsy fancies has descended\r\nto us through long ages, and is still deeply engrafted on the",
  "a0100.png": "popular mind, in spite of the extension of wholesome intelligence.\r\nEven witchcraft, the most repulsive of all delusions,\r\nhas still its believers in our own country as in others. It is\r\nonly five years since that a man (who was found to be insane\r\nat the time) was tried at Warwick Assizes for the murder of an\r\nold woman at Long Compton, and it was proved, in evidence,\r\nthat fully one-third of the villagers believed in witchcraft!\r\n\r\nIn the following pages will be found many instances of\r\ncredulities, nearly as strange, still current at home and elsewhere.\r\nThe growth of superstition is rapid, and its decline is slow.\r\nThe early Fathers of the Church battled manfully against some\r\nof the corroding prejudices of their time. St. Chrysostom (of\r\n\"the Golden Mouth\") observes in one of his homilies, \"The\r\npeople suspect everything, and are more in bondage than if\r\nthey were slaves many times over.\" Some of the vulgar notions\r\nhe thus mentions: \"This or that man was the first to meet me\r\nwhen I walked out; consequently innumerable ills will certainly\r\nbefal me: that confounded servant of mine, in giving me my\r\nshoes, handed me the left shoe first; this indicates dire calamities\r\nand insults: as I stepped out, I started with the left foot\r\nforemost; this, too, is a sign of misfortune: my right eye\r\ntwitched upwards as I went out; this portends tears. To\r\nstrike the woof with the comb in a particular way, the braying\r\nof a donkey, the crowing of a cock, a sudden sneeze,--all these\r\nwere indications of something or other.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet this most renowned of the Greek fathers was himself\r\na believer in demoniacal possession, exorcism, and miracles\r\nwrought by the relics of martyrs!\r\n\r\nEven in the \"Augustan age\" of Queen Anne, we meet with\r\nnearly similar puerilities of belief to those mentioned by the\r\nhomilist of preceding centuries. Addison remarks, \"As if the\r\nnatural calamities of life were not sufficient for it, we turn the",
  "a0110.png": "most indifferent circumstances into misfortunes, and suffer as\r\nmuch from trifling accidents as from real evils. I have known\r\nthe shooting of a star spoil a night's rest; and have seen a\r\nman in love grow pale, and lose his appetite, upon the plucking of\r\na merry-thought. A screech-owl at midnight has alarmed a family\r\nmore than a band of robbers; nay, the voice of a cricket hath\r\nstruck more terror than the roaring of a lion. There is nothing\r\nso inconsiderable, which may not appear dreadful to an imagination\r\nthat is filled with omens and prognostics. A rusty nail\r\nor a crooked pin shoot up into prodigies.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an inherent tendency, belonging to the weakness\r\nand dependence of human nature, to regard with partiality anything\r\nstrange, or even, it may be, unreasonable; the soil of\r\nthe mind is prolific in the cultivation of morbid fancies, and it\r\nis a hard matter to extirpate them. Threats of evil and promises\r\nof good, give imposture a hold that all the force of reason\r\nand fact cannot always loosen. It is only by exposing fallacies\r\nthat we can hope for their extinction, but this is no easy matter,\r\nremembering the axiom, that there is no truth, however pure\r\nand sacred, upon which falsehood cannot fasten and engraft\r\nitself therein. Still, there is hope for improvement; already\r\nsteam, electricity, and other achievements of science are dissipating\r\nmany popular delusions; ghosts, goblins, and fairies are\r\nloosening their hold on the imaginations of even children, and\r\nthe practical tendency of the age is to apply a crucial test to\r\nwhatever appears peculiar or unnatural. Above all, the sublime\r\nspirit of Christianity is piercing deeper through the shadows of\r\ndoubt and error, bringing to light \"the hidden works of darkness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice the singular affinity of certain credulities\r\nin different parts of the world. In the following pages I\r\nhave given several remarkable instances of this character",
  "a0120.png": "Much labour has been expended by far wiser heads and abler\r\npens than my own, in endeavours to trace the common origin\r\nof certain superstitions; in some cases successfully: but much\r\nthat is mysterious remains for solution, and these are studies of\r\ndeep interest in the history of man. The birth of superstition\r\nmust have arisen, in the earliest ages, from the dread and\r\nwonder excited by the phenomena of the elements:\r\n\r\n\"No natural exhalation in the sky,\r\nNo scope of nature, no distemper'd day,\r\nNo common wind, no custom\u00e8d event,\r\nBut they will pluck away his natural cause,\r\nAnd call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,\r\nAbortions, presages, and tongues of heav'n!\"",
  "p0010.png": "\r\nCredulities Past & Present.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE SEA AND SEAMEN.\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIONS connected with that greatest among\r\nthe marvels of creation--the SEA, have been a fertile\r\nsource of imagination to the credulous, from the earliest\r\ntimes; and especially to those whose lives were mostly spent on\r\nits mysterious expanse, who \"go down to the sea in ships, and\r\noccupy their business in great waters. These men see the\r\nworks of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the \"many-sounding\" sea should\r\nhave found utterances; that the uneducated mind would exaggerate\r\nbeyond the bounds of reason, when poets and writers of\r\nall times have indulged in marvellous relations, which a knowledge\r\nof natural phenomena might, in most instances, easily\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nThe ancient mariners performed their voyages in a vague\r\nmist of capricious doubts and fears, omens and prognostics,\r\nwhich excited terror or inspired confidence. Every object that\r\nmet their gaze was endowed with some miraculous agency for\r\ngood or otherwise. Their course over unknown waters, peopled\r\nby their mythology with imaginary creatures, would naturally\r\ncreate awe and suspicion. Leigh Hunt, in one of his essays,\r\nalludes to the probable sensations of an ancient believer in the\r\npresence of his haunting fancies--\"With similar feelings he",
  "p0020.png": "would cross the ocean, an element that naturally detaches the\r\nmind from earth, and which the ancients regarded as especially\r\ndoing so. He had been in the Carpathian Sea, the favourite\r\nhaunt of Proteus, who was supposed to be gifted above every\r\nother deity with a knowledge of the causes of things. Towards\r\nevening, when the winds were rising, and the sailors had made\r\ntheir vows to Neptune, he would think of 'the old shepherd of\r\nthe seas of yore,' and believe it possible that he might become\r\nvisible to his eyesight, driving through the darkling waters, and\r\nturning the sacred wildness of his face towards the blessed\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\nHorace, lamenting the departure of Virgil for Athens, rebukes\r\nthe impiety of the first mariner who ventured, in the audacity\r\nof his heart, to go afloat and cross the briny barrier interposed\r\nbetween nations. He esteems a merchant favoured specially\r\nby the gods should he twice or thrice return in safety from an\r\nAtlantic cruise. He tells us that he had himself known the\r\nterrors of the dark gulf of the Adriatic, and had experienced\r\nthe treachery of the western gale. The ancients, however, did\r\nnot dare to venture far upon the open sea, but coasted along\r\nfrom shore to shore. It was considered wonderful to make a\r\nshort sea voyage. In the time of Homer, great preparations\r\nand much deliberation were required, before the heroes resolved\r\nto cross the \u00c6g\u00e6an Sea. The expedition of Jason and the\r\nArgonauts--that is to say, the passage over the Propontis and\r\nPont Euxine--was considered a marvellous exploit. Apollonius\r\nRhodius describes the Argonauts as suddenly benighted at sea,\r\nin broad daylight, by a dense black fog. They pray to Apollo,\r\nand he descends from heaven, and lighting on a rock, holds up\r\nhis illustrious bow, which shoots a guiding light farther to an\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary delusions with regard to the watery element\r\nprevailed through a long period of time.\r\n\r\nAgobard, Archbishop of Lyons in the reign of Charlemagne\r\nand his son, has the following passage in his book, \"De Grandine.\"\r\n\"In these districts, almost all persons, noble and",
  "p0030.png": "plebeian, townsmen and rustics, old and young, believe that\r\nhail and thunder may be produced at the will of man--that is,\r\nby the incantations of certain men who are called tempestarii.\"\r\nHe proceeds, \"We have seen and heard many who are sunk in\r\nsuch folly and stupidity, as to believe and assert, that there is\r\na certain country which they call Magonia, whence ships come\r\nin the clouds, for the purpose of carrying back the corn which\r\nis beaten off by the hail and storms, and which those a\u00ebrial sailors\r\npurchase of the said tempestarii.\" Agobard afterwards affirms\r\nthat he himself saw in a certain assembly four persons, three\r\nmen and a woman, exhibited bound, as if they had fallen from\r\nthese ships, who had been kept for some days in confinement,\r\nand were now brought out to be stoned in his presence, but\r\nthat he rescued them from the popular fury.[*] Gervase, of Tilbury,\r\nin his \"Otia Imperialia\" (composed about A.D. 1211),\r\nrelates, that as the people were coming out from a church in\r\nEngland, on a dark cloudy day, they saw a ship's anchor\r\nfastened in a heap of stones, with its cable reaching up from it\r\ninto the clouds. Presently they saw the cable strained, as if\r\nthe crew were trying to haul it up, but it still stuck fast. Voices\r\nwere then heard above the clouds, apparently in clamorous\r\ndebate, and a sailor came sliding down the cable. As soon as\r\nhe touched the ground the crowd gathered round him, and he\r\ndied, like a man drowned at sea, suffocated by our damp thick\r\natmosphere. An hour afterwards, his shipmates cut the cable\r\nand sailed away; and the anchor they had left behind was\r\nmade into fastenings and ornaments for the church door, in\r\nmemory of the wondrous event.\r\n\r\nGervase of Tilbury also relates that a native of Bristol sailed\r\nfrom that port to Ireland, leaving his wife and family at home.\r\nHis ship was driven far out of its course to the remote parts\r\n\r\n* In Hone's \"Every-Day Book,\" vol. ii., there is a reprint of the\r\nfollowing curious tract, which is described as rare: \"A True Account of\r\ndivers most strange and prodigious Apparitions seen in the Air at Poins\r\nTown, in the county of Tipperary, in Ireland, March the second, 1678-9.\r\nAttested by Sixteen Persons that were Eye-witnesses. Published at Dublin,\r\nand then communicated hither. Licensed 1679, London, printed for J. C.,\r\n1679.\"",

At that very\r\nmoment his wife was seated at table with their children in the\r\nhouse at Bristol, and behold, the knife fell through the open\r\nskylight, and stuck in the table before her. She recognised it\r\nimmediately, and when her husband came home long afterwards,\r\nthey compared notes, and found that the time when the\r\nknife had fallen from his hands corresponded exactly with that\r\nin which it had been so strangely recovered.\r\n\r\n\"Who, then,\" exclaims Gervase, \"after such evidence as this,\r\nwill doubt the existence of a sea above this earth of ours,\r\nsituated in the air, or over it?\" Such a sea is still known in\r\nCeltic tradition. \"If our fathers have not lied,\" say the peasants\r\nof La Vend\u00e9e, \"there are birds that know the way of the upper\r\nsea, and may no doubt carry a message to the blessed in\r\nParadise.\"[*]\r\n\r\nIn the days of Sir Francis Drake the vulgar people supposed\r\nthe world to be composed of two parallel planes, the one at a\r\ncertain distance from the other. In reference to this space it\r\nwas commonly said that Sir Francis had \"shot the gulf,\" meaning\r\nthat his ship had turned over the edge of the upper plane, so as\r\nto pass on to the waters of the under. \"There is,\" says Mr.\r\nDavies Gilbert, \"an old picture of Drake at Oxford, representing\r\nhim holding a pistol in one hand, which, in former years, the\r\nman who acted as showman to strangers was wont to say (still\r\nimproving upon the story) was the very pistol with which Sir\r\nFrancis shot the gulf!\"\r\n\r\nBy the \"Nauticum Astrologicum,\" directing merchants,\r\nmariners, captains of ships, insurers, etc., how (by God's\r\nblessing) they may escape divers dangers, which commonly\r\nhappen in the ocean, the posthumous work of John Gadbury\r\n\r\n* \"That there are waters in the Regions of the Blessed, Bede, it is said,\r\nassures us for this reason, that they are necessary there to temper the heat\r\nof the sun. And Cornelius \u00e0 Lapide has found out a most admirable use\r\nfor them above the firmament, which is to make rivers, and fountains, and\r\nwaterworks for the recreation of the souls in bliss, whose seat is in the\r\nEmpyrean Heaven.\"--Southey.",
  "p0050.png": "(1710), it appears that astrological figures were often made\r\nconcerning the voyages of ships from London to Newcastle, etc.\r\nIn one part the predictor tells us his answer was verified; the\r\nship, though not lost, had been in great danger thereof, having\r\nunhappily run aground at Newcastle, sprung a shroud, and\r\nwholly lost her keel. At page 93, there is a figure given of\r\na ship that set sail from London towards Newcastle, Aug. 27,\r\n11 p.m., 1669. This proved a fortunate voyage. \"As, indeed,\"\r\nsaith our author, \"under so auspicious a position of heaven, it\r\nhad been strange if she had missed so to have done; for herein\r\nyou see Jupiter in the ascendant in sextile aspect of the sun;\r\nand the moon, who is lady of the horoscope, and governess of\r\nthe hour in which she weighed anchor, is applying ad trinum\r\nVeneris. She returned to London again, very well laden, in\r\nthree weeks' time, to the great content as well as advantage of\r\nthe owner.\"\r\n\r\nLodge, in his \"Incarnate Devils\" (1596), speaks of \"a divell\r\nwho persuades the merchant not to traffique, because it is given\r\nhim in his nativitie to have losse by sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice how the superstitions of pagan times,\r\nmodified according to the change in religious belief, have been\r\ninterwoven in successive ages with each other, and are not\r\neven yet extinct among the seafaring communities of various\r\ncountries. The monks in the middle ages were the chroniclers\r\nof saintly interpositions at sea, similar functions to those of the\r\nmaritime gods of the ancients. A goodly harvest of delusions\r\ncame from the monastic granary, but independent of these, the\r\ngross ignorance and misconception which prevailed, until within\r\na comparatively late period, of the most ordinary principles of\r\nmeteorology, and nautical science generally, encouraged a faith\r\nin the supernatural, and gave a loose rein to credulity. It is\r\nscarcely half a century ago that in the west of England, a\r\nstrange hollow noise on the sea-coast was supposed to proceed\r\nfrom a spirit called Bucca, and foretold a tempest. This was a\r\nmatter of terror to all mariners on the coast. It is well known\r\nthat sound travels much faster than currents in the air; it was,",
  "p0060.png": "therefore, the former that indicated the approach of a very\r\nheavy storm, which seldom takes place on that wild and rocky\r\nshore without a shipwreck on some parts of its extensive coasts\r\nsurrounded by the Atlantic.[*]\r\n\r\nConsidering the great advance of modern intelligence, there\r\nis no great reason to boast of an immunity from gross superstitions;\r\nso late as 1857, a horrible murder was committed at sea\r\non board the Raby Castle, by Karl Anderson, a Swede, on a\r\nfellow sailor, a mulatto, under an hallucination that the victim\r\nwas a Russian Fin. It seems that the Fins are supposed to\r\nhave the power of drawing blood from anything, even a ship's\r\nmainmast!\r\n\r\nIgnorance is the parent of superstition, as it frequently is of\r\ndisasters at sea; for the want of nautical experience is too often\r\nthe cause of shipwrecks. Landsmen, however, as well as seamen,\r\nhave their strange beliefs and their vulgar prejudices.\r\nThat such should be the case is a reproach to our boasted\r\ncivilisation. The favourite doctrine of \"luck,\" good and bad\r\nauguries, inauspicious days, fortune-telling, and a host of similar\r\nabsurdities, are still current throughout the length and breadth\r\nof the land; so we should not judge too harshly the credulity\r\nof seamen, whose isolated occupations and peculiar mode of\r\nlife render them more susceptible of fanciful impressions.\r\nAlthough the boldest men alive in action, yet they are frequently\r\nthe very abject slaves of superstition. \"Innumerable,\"\r\nobserves Scot, in his \"Discoverie of Witchcraft,\" [** \"]are the reports\r\nof accidents unto such as frequent the seas, as fishermen and\r\nsailors, who discourse of noises, flashes, fires, shadows, echoes,\r\nand other things nightly seen or heard upon the water.\"\r\nAndrews remarks, \"superstition and profaneness, those\r\nextremes of human conduct, are too often found united in the\r\nsailor; and the man who dreads the stormy effect of drowning\r\na cat, or of whistling a country dance, while he leans over the\r\ngunwale, will, too often, wantonly defy his Creator by the most\r\ndaring execrations, and the most licentious behaviour.\"\r\n\r\n* Sir Humphrey Davy's \"Salmonia.\"",
  "p0070.png": "\r\nIt has been truly said that a sailor is the oddest compound\r\nin existence: his habits, his feelings, his language are peculiar\r\nto himself alone. He displays the most noble and exalted\r\nvirtues when roused into exertion; but too frequently indulges\r\nin gross habits and degrading vices. He is a child in sympathetic\r\nfeeling, yet a stern hero in the hour of danger; undauntedly\r\nfaces and defies death on deck, amidst the blood\r\nand slaughter of battle, and yet shrinks with indescribable\r\napprehension on shore at the sight of a coffin.\r\n\r\n\"Our own sailors,\" remarks Southey, \"sometimes ascribe\r\nconsciousness and sympathy to their ship. It is a common\r\nexpression with them, 'She behaves well;' and they persuade\r\nthemselves that an English man-of-war, by reason of its own\r\nwill, sails faster in pursuit of a Frenchman than at any other\r\ntime. Poor old Captain Adkins was firmly possessed with this\r\nbelief. On such occasions he would talk to his ship, as an\r\nArabian to his horse, urge and entreat her to exert herself and\r\nput forth all her speed, and promise to reward her with a new\r\ncoat of paint as soon as they should get into harbour. 'Who,'\r\nsays Fuller, 'can, without pity or pleasure, behold that trusty\r\nvessel which carried Sir Francis Drake about the world?'\"\r\n\r\nSo naturally are men led to impute something like vitality to\r\nso great a work of human formation, that persons connected\r\nwith the shipping trade talk of the \"average life of a ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Jack's belief in the supernatural will\r\nprobably be one of the last strongholds of superstition; for\r\nthe obstinacy of his character will hold out long, despite \"the\r\nschoolmaster abroad.\" Falconer thus describes this peculiarity\r\nin the old English seaman:\r\n\r\n\"Each veteran rule he prized,\r\nAnd all improvements utterly despised.\"\r\n\r\nBacon na\u00efvely observes: \"One was saying 'that his great\r\ngrandfather, and grandfather, and father died at sea.' Said\r\nanother that heard him, 'An I were as you, I would never\r\ncome at sea.' 'Why?' said he--'where did your great grandfather,\r\ngrandfather, and father die?' 'Where, but in their\r\nbeds!' An I were as you, then, I would never come to bed!'\"",
  "p0080.png": "\r\nAddison, in the Spectator (No. 27), says: \"It is an old\r\nobservation that a time of peace is always a time of prodigies;\r\nfor as our news-writers must adorn their papers with that which\r\nthe critics call the 'marvellous,' they are forced, in a dead\r\ncalm of affairs, to ransack every element for proper amusements,\r\nand either to astonish their readers from time to time\r\nwith a strange and wonderful sight, or be content to lose their\r\ncustom. The sea is generally filled with monsters when there are\r\nno fleets upon it.\"\r\n\r\nOMENS for good or for evil were derived from birds and\r\nmarine animals. Sir Thomas Browne, in his \"Vulgar\r\nErrors,\" says: \"That a kingfisher hanged by the bill sheweth\r\nwhat quarter the wind is, by an occult and secret property,\r\nconverting the breast to that part of the horizon from whence\r\nthe wind doth blow. This is a received opinion, and very\r\nstrange, introducing natural weathercocks and extending\r\nmagnetical positions as far as animal natures, a conceit supported\r\nchiefly by present practice, yet not made out by reason\r\nnor experience.\"\r\n\r\nShakspeare alludes to the halcyon when he says:\r\n\r\n\"Disown, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks,\r\nWith every gale and vary of their masters.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancients believed that so long as the female kingfishers sat\r\non their eggs, no storm or tempest disturbed the ocean. In\r\nWild's \"Iter Boreale\" we read:\r\n\r\n\"The peaceful kingfishers are met together\r\nAbout the decks, and prophecy calm weather.\"\r\n\r\nDryden says:\r\n\r\n\"Amidst our arms as quiet you shall be,\r\nAs halcyons breeding on a winter's sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"The halcyon,\" observes Willford, in his \"Nature's Secret,\"\r\n\"at the time of breeding, which is about fourteen days before\r\nthe winter's solstice, foreshows a quiet and tranquil time, as it\r\nis observed about the coasts of Sicily, from whence the proverb\r\nis transported of 'halcyon days.'\"[*]\r\n\r\n* Gmelin tells us that the Tartars pluck the feathers from a kingfisher,\r\n\"cast them into the water, and carefully preserve such as float, pretending",
  "p0090.png": "\r\nPennant says that \"the great auk is a bird observed by\r\nseamen never to wander beyond soundings; and, according to its\r\nappearance, they direct their measures, being assured that land\r\nis not very remote. Thus sailors, in modern times, paid regard\r\nto auguries, in the same manner as Aristophanes tells us the\r\nGreek mariners did more than two thousand years ago;[**: ?]\r\n\r\n\"From birds in sailing, men instructions take,\r\nNow lie in port, now sail, and profit make.\"\r\n\r\nThe osprey is abundant, during the summer, along the coasts\r\nof North America; and its presence is hailed by the fishermen\r\nwith the same feelings of satisfaction as the appearance of the\r\ngannet upon our own shores. The most certain of all indices,\r\nthe appearance of the osprey, is awaited with much anxiety by\r\nthe fishermen of those coasts before they commence the toils\r\nof the season. Protected by them, as the other harbingers of\r\nsummer are upon the land, to molest one in a fleet of fishermen\r\nmight be attended with unpleasant consequences. Wilson,\r\nthe ornithologist of America, alludes to the bird in his \"Fisherman's\r\nhymn:\"\r\n\r\n\"The osprey sails above the sound\r\nThe geese are gone, the gulls are flying;\r\nThe herring shoals swarm thick around,\r\nThe nets are launch'd, the boats are plying.\r\nYo, yo, my hearts! Let's seek the deep,\r\nRaise high the song, and cheerly wish her,\r\nStill as the bending net we sweep,\r\nGod bless the fish-hawk, and the fisher!\"\r\n\r\nThe tern is considered in the same light by fishermen as the\r\nharbinger of a good and prosperous fishing season. Its appearance\r\nwas similarly appreciated by the sagas of the Norse Vikings:\r\n\r\n\"Now let the steed of ocean bound\r\nO'er the North Sea, with dashing sound;\r\nLet nimble tern, and screaming gull\r\nFly round and round; our net is full.\"\r\n\r\nthat if with one of these feathers they touch a woman, or even her clothes,\r\nshe must fall in love with them. The Ostiacs take the skin, the bill, and\r\nthe claws of this bird, shutting them up in a purse, and so long as they\r\npreserve this sort of amulet, they believe they have no ill to fear. The\r\nperson who taught me this means of living happy, could not forbear shedding\r\ntears, while he told me that the loss of a kingfisher's skin had caused him to\r\nlose both his wife and his goods.\"--Gmelin, \"Voyage en Sib\u00e9rie.\"",
  "p0100.png": "\r\nThe stormy petrels, the \"Mother Carey's Chickens\" of early\r\ntimes, bring to the mariners of all nations apprehensions of\r\nfearful dangers, owing probably to the appearance of the birds,\r\nwhen perhaps a thousand miles from any land; apparently un-*tired[**untired],\r\nand seldom seen resting or eating; together with its\r\nominous colour:\r\n\r\n\"O'er the deep, o'er the deep!\r\nWhere the whale, and the shark, and the sword-fish sleep,\r\nOutflying the blast and the driving rain,\r\nThe petrel telleth her tale in vain;\r\nFor the mariner curseth the warning bird,\r\nWho bringeth him news of storms we heard.\r\nOh! thus does the prophet of good or ill\r\nMeet hate from the creatures he serveth still;\r\nYet he ne'er falters, so, Petrel, spring\r\nOnce more o'er the waves, on thy stormy wing!\"\r\n\r\nPennant says that the petrel cautions the seamen of the approach\r\nof a tempest by collecting under the stern of a ship.\r\nThis is probably to catch up the small animals which the agitated\r\nocean brings near the surface, or any food that may be dropped\r\nfrom the vessel. When the storm subsides they are no more seen.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find crows employed in the early ages as\r\nguides to mariners. Arngrim Jonas tells us that when Flock, a\r\nfamous Norwegian navigator, was going to set out from Shetland\r\nto Iceland (then called Gardarsholm), he took on board some\r\ncrows, because the mariner's compass was not then in use.\r\nWhen he thought he had made a considerable part of his way,\r\nhe threw up one of his crows, which, seeing land astern, flew\r\nto it; when Flock, concluding that he was nearer to Shetland\r\nthan any other land (perhaps, rather F\u00e6roe), kept on his course\r\nfor some time, and then sent out another crow, which seeing no\r\nland, returned to the vessel. At last, having run the greater\r\npart of the way, another crow was sent out by him, which,\r\nseeing land ahead, immediately flew for it, and Flock, following\r\nhis guide, fell in with the east end of the island. Such was the\r\nsimple mode of keeping a reckoning and steering their course\r\npractised by the bold navigators of the stormy northern ocean.[*]\r\n\r\n* The ancient coins of Phoc\u00e6a[**typo?

Sir Walter\r\nScott relates that his friend, Mr. William Clark, on a journey to\r\nLondon by mail coach, found himself in company with a seafaring\r\nman of middle age and respectable appearance, who announced\r\nhimself as master of a vessel in the Baltic trade. In\r\nthe course of the desultory talk which occurs on such occasions\r\nthe seaman observed, in compliance with a common superstition:\r\n\r\n\"I wish we may have good luck on our journey--there is a\r\nmagpie.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should that be unlucky?\" said my friend.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you that,\" replied the seaman, \"but all the\r\nworld agrees that one magpie bodes ill-luck; two are not so\r\nbad, but three are the evil one himself.

The\r\nname of Phoc\u00e6a, or, as we might translate it, Sealtown, was therefore given\r\nto the newly founded city; and a seal was, probably, made an object of\r\nperiodical sacrifices to Neptune, and so became a sacred symbol.\r\n\r\nMany other omens, apart from those derived from animals, prevailed in\r\nearly times. Thus we are told in the Norwegian chronicles, that one\r\nIngolf, and his friend Lief, determined in 874 to abandon their country,\r\nand seek an asylum in Iceland. On approaching the island, Ingolf, conformably\r\nwith an ancient superstition of his country, threw overboard two\r\nwooden columns of the temple of his gods, determining to make his first\r\nlanding on that part of the coast to which the gods should direct the floating\r\nguide; but the current having carried it away from his sight, he landed\r\nin a fiord, or gulf, on the southern part of the island, which still bears his\r\nname.",

Hence\r\nsailors regarded this companion of their voyages with superstitious\r\nfondness.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious instances of a belief in bird-omens\r\noccurred as recently as 1857. Captain Johnson, of the Norwegian\r\nbarque Ellen, which fortunately picked up forty-nine of\r\nthe passengers and crew of the ship Central America, after the\r\nsteamer had sunk, arrived at New York, September 20, and made\r\nthe following singular statement:\r\n\r\n\"Just before six o'clock in the afternoon of September 12, I\r\n\r\n* For anglers, in spring, it is a bad omen to see single magpies, but two\r\nmay be considered a favourable augury.

When two go\r\nout together, it is only when the weather is warm and mild, and favourable\r\nfor fishing.\r\n\r\nIn M. G. Lewis's ballad of \"Bill Jones,\" we read:\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, well-a-day,' the sailor said,\r\n'Some danger must impend,\r\nThree ravens sit in yonder glade,\r\nAnd evil will happen, I'm sore afraid,\r\nEre we reach our journey's end.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what have the ravens with us to do?\r\nDoes their sight betoken us evil?'\r\n'To see one raven is lucky, 'tis true,\r\nBut it's certain misfortune to light upon two,\r\nAnd meeting with three is the devil.'\"",

The bird was unlike any bird I\r\never saw, nor do I know its name. The colour of its feathers\r\nwas a dark iron-grey; its body was a foot and a half in length,\r\nwith wings three and a half feet from tip to tip. It had a beak\r\nfull eight inches long, and a set of teeth like a small hand-saw.\r\nIn capturing the bird it gave me a good bite on my right thumb;\r\ntwo of the crew who assisted in tying its legs were also bitten.\r\nAs it strove to bite everybody, I had its head afterwards cut off,\r\nand the body thrown overboard.\r\n\r\n\"When the bird flew to the ship, the barque was going a little\r\nnorth of north-east.

It had come on board the ship the evening\r\nbefore the action, and had remained in her afterwards. The\r\nadmiral's cabin was its chief residence, but it was fed and petted\r\nby all who came near it, for sailors regard the arrival of a bird\r\nas a promise of victory, or at least an excellent omen. It flew\r\naway soon after the ship reached Naples.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Life of Rodney\" it is related that in the famous\r\nvictory of the 12th April, 1782, a bantam cock perched himself\r\nupon the poop of Rodney's ship, and at every broadside that\r\nwas poured into the Ville-de-Paris, clapped his wings and crew.\r\nRodney gave special orders that this cock should be taken care\r\nof as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny the buteo was a species of hawk used in\r\nauguries. It gave its name to a family of the Fabians, because\r\na bird of this species settled on the general's ship, and afforded\r\na lucky omen.\r\n\r\nDolphins and porpoises, when they play about, are said to\r\nforetell a storm; hence they are considered as unlucky omens\r\nby the sailor. In the \"Canterbury Guests,\" a comedy by\r\nRavenscroft, we read: \"My heart begins to leap and play like\r\na porpoise before a storm.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancients, however, regarded the appearance of the\r\ndolphin as a sign of fair weather. According to old fables, the\r\ndolphins and porpoises offered themselves, in times of storms,\r\nto convey shipwrecked mariners to shore. The story of Arion\r\nis well known, but in no instance has the Lesbian poet been\r\nintroduced with so much grace and beauty as by Spenser in\r\nthe \"Marriage of the Thames and Medway\":\r\n\r\n\"Then, there was heard a most celestiall sound\r\nOf dainty musicke, which did next ensue\r\nBefore the Spouse.

  "p0150.png": "\r\nLike many other old pagan fictions, this classic myth was\r\ninvested by the earlier Christian converts with a deeper, holier\r\nmeaning; and the dolphin, so constantly recognised in sculptures\r\nand frescoes, points not to the deliverer of Arion, but to\r\nHim who, through the waters of baptism, opens to mankind\r\nthe path of deliverance.\r\n\r\nPliny tells us that dolphins like music, and will come when\r\ncalled for by those who are accustomed to feed them, and can\r\nswim as swift as an arrow can be shot from a bow. The\r\ndolphin plays no inconsiderable part in the mythological lore\r\nof the ancients. The Romans, when fishing for the tunny,\r\nused to invoke the name of Alexicacus, or Neptune, that their\r\nnets might be preserved from the swordfish, which used to tear\r\nthem, and prevent the assistance which, it was asserted, the\r\ndolphins used to give the tunny on these occasions.\r\n\r\nSea-urchins thrusting themselves in the mud, or striving to\r\ncover their bodies with sand, forbode a storm; cockles, and\r\nmost shell-fish, are observed, when a tempest is brooding, to\r\nhave gravel sticking hard into their shells, as a providence of\r\nnature to stay or poise themselves, and to help to weigh them\r\ndown if raised from the bottom by surges.\r\n\r\nMany fishes possess the power of keeping themselves secure\r\namidst the turmoil of a storm by affixing themselves to a rock,\r\nor other steady substance. Among the most remarkable of\r\nthese is the remora, or sucking-fish (echeneis), which the ancients\r\nimagined had the power to impede or arrest the course of a\r\nship, a fable which continued to be credited until very late\r\ntimes. Thus, it was alleged, Anthony's ship was detained from\r\ngetting soon enough into action on the memorable and decisive\r\nbattle of Actium.[*]\r\n\r\n* Magnus Heigninsen, who was sent by Frederick II., King of Denmark,\r\nto discover Greenland, after many mishaps did so; but was not able\r\nto get near it, because, before he had seen the land, his ship stopped short,\r\nat which he was much astonished, and with reason, for it was in the open\r\nsea, and in great depth of water; there was no ice, and the wind was fresh.\r\nUnable to go forward, he was obliged to return to Denmark, where he reported\r\nwhat had happened to him, and told the king that there were load-*stones[**unhyphenated on 160.png]\r\nat the bottom of the sea, which had arrested his vessel!

Pennant says that in the Indian\r\nseas this species has been found of such a size as to measure\r\ntwo fathoms in breadth across the central part, while each arm\r\nhas measured nine fathoms in length; and that the natives of\r\nthe Indian isles, when sailing in their canoes, always take care\r\nto be provided with hatchets, in order to cut off immediately\r\nthe arms of such of those animals as happened to fling them\r\nover the sides of the canoes, lest they should pull them under\r\nthe water and sink them. This has been considered a credulity\r\nin Pennant, unworthy of a steady naturalist.\r\n\r\nknown the history of the remora, perhaps he would have given that as a\r\nreason, as well as the loadstone. This occurred in 1588.\r\n\r\nLivingstone states that the Barotse believe that at certain parts of the\r\nriver Leeambi, in South Africa, a tremendous monster lies hid, and that it\r\nwill catch a canoe, and hold it fast and motionless, in spite of the utmost\r\nexertions of the paddlers. While near Nameta, they even objected to pass\r\na spot supposed to be haunted. They believe that some of their countrymen\r\npossess a knowledge of the proper prayer to lay the monster. It is\r\nstrange to find fables similar to those of the more northern nations even in\r\nthe heart of Africa. Can they be vestiges of traditions of animals that no\r\nlonger exist?\r\n\r\nAmong the northern nations, Neccus, the malign deity of the waters, was\r\nmuch dreaded. If any perished by cramp, or in whirlpools, or by bad\r\nswimming, he was thought to be seized by Neccus. Steel was thought to\r\nexpel him, and therefore all who bathed threw some little pieces of steel in\r\nthe water for that purpose.",

Several old writers assert this, and Holinshed\r\ngravely declares that with his own eyes he saw the feathers of\r\nthese barnacles \"hang out of the shell at least two inches.\"\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis gives similar ocular testimony. \"Who,\"\r\nhe says, \"can marvel that this should be so?

When it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth\r\nopen, and the first thing that appeareth is the aforesaid lace or\r\nstring; next come the legs of a bird hanging out, and as it\r\ngroweth greater, it openeth the shell by degrees, till at length\r\nit is all come forth, and hangeth only by the bill; in a short\r\ntime after it cometh to full maturity, and falleth into the sea,\r\nwhere it gathereth feathers, and groweth to fowle bigger than a\r\nmallard, and less than a goose, having black legs, and bill or\r\nbeak, and feathers black and white, spotted in such a manner\r\nas is our magpie, called in some places a pie-annet, which the\r\npeople of Lancashire call by no other name than a tree-goose;\r\nwhich place, and all those parts adjoining, do so much abound\r\ntherewith that one of the best may be bought for threepence.\"[*]\r\n\r\n* William Barentz and his companions, on their voyage into the North\r\nSea in 1594-1596, refuted Gerard's errors respecting the barnacle, which\r\nis noticed by Thomas Johnson, the editor of the second edition of the\r\n\"Herbal,\" published in 1633: \"The burnakles, whose fabulous breed my\r\nauthor here sets downe, and diuvers[**P2 typo for diuers?] others have also deliuered[**typo for delivered?|P2:17th century style spelling], were found\r\nby some Hollanders to have had another originall, and that by egges, as",

Enormous oyster-shells are used for holy water in\r\nsome continental churches. One oyster was known to be\r\nninety years old, by the layers of the shell.\r\n\r\nDuring the oyster-dredging, the fishermen keep up a wild\r\nmonotonous song, or rather chaunt, which they assert charm the\r\noysters into the dredge:\r\n\r\n\"The herring loves the merry moonlight,\r\nThe mackerel loves the wind,\r\nBut the oyster loves the dredgers' song,\r\nFor he comes of a gentle kind.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to some Norwegian writers, the fishermen often see\r\n\r\nother birds haue; for they in their third voyage to finde out the North-east\r\npassage to China and the Molucco's, about the eightieth degree and eleven\r\nminutes of Northerly latitude, found two little islands, in one of which they\r\nfound aboundance of these geese sitting vpon their egges, of which they got\r\none goose, and tooke away sixty egges.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in Dr. Aikins's \"Athen\u00e6um\" quotes the following curious\r\naccount of barnacles from an old author.

At Nimroud, a gigantic image was found by Layard,\r\nrepresenting a fish's head as a cap, and the body of the fish depending\r\nover his shoulders, his legs those of a man; a richly-decorated\r\nbag was in his left hand. On the coins of Ascalon is\r\nfigured a goddess, above whose head is a half-moon, and at her\r\nfeet a woman, with her lower extremities like a fish.\r\n\r\nThe tritons and the syrens are represented as half fish and\r\nhalf human. Originally, the syrens were winged, but after the\r\nfable had been accepted, which told of their strife with the\r\nMuses, and their precipitation into the sea, they were figured\r\nlike mermaids.[*] It is curious how the prevalence of tales of\r\nmermaids exists among Celtic populations, indicating these\r\nwater-nymphs as having been originally deities of those people.\r\nThe Peruvians had, also, their semi-fish gods.

This creature appears like a\r\nwoman as far down as her waist, with breasts and bosom like a\r\nwoman, long hands and soft hair; the neck and head in all\r\nrespects like a human being. The hands seem to people to be\r\nlong, and the fingers not to be parted, but united by a web like\r\nthat on the feet of water birds. From the waist downwards,\r\nthis monster resembles a fish with scales, tail, and fin. This\r\nprodigy is supposed to show itself more especially before heavy\r\nstorms. The habit of this creature is to dive frequently, and\r\nrise again to the surface with fish in its hands. When sailors\r\nsee it playing with the fish, or throwing them towards the ship,\r\nthey fear they are doomed to lose several of the crew; but when\r\nit casts the fish, or turning from the vessel, flings them away\r\nfrom her, then the sailors take it as a good omen, that they will\r\nnot suffer loss in the impending storm. The monster has a\r\nvery horrible face, with broad brow and piercing eyes, a wide\r\nmouth and double chin.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Landnama,\" or Icelandic Doomsday Book, tells of a\r\nMarmennil, or merman, having been caught off the island of\r\nGrimsey, and the annals of the same country relate the appearance\r\nof these creatures off the coast in 1305, and 1329.\r\n\r\nMegasthenes reported that the sea which washed Taprobana,\r\nthe modern Ceylon, was inhabited by monsters having the\r\nappearance of a woman, and \u00c6lian improved this account by\r\nstating that there were whales having the appearance of satyrs!\r\n\r\nIn 1187, a merman was stated to have been taken off the\r\ncoast of Suffolk. It closely resembled a man, but was not\r\ngifted with speech. One day when it had the opportunity to\r\nescape, it fled to the sea, plunged in, and was never afterwards\r\nseen. Pontoppidan, in his \"Natural History of Norway,\"\r\nrecords the appearance of a merman, which was deposed to on\r\noath by the observers. About a mile from the coast of\r\nDenmark, near Landscrona, three sailors observed something",
  "p0220.png": "floating, like a dead body, in the water, and they rowed towards\r\nit. When they came within seven or eight fathoms, it still\r\nappeared as at first, for it had not stirred, but at that instant it\r\nsunk, and came up almost immediately in the same place.\r\nUpon this, out of fear, they lay still, and then let the boat float,\r\nso that they might better examine the monster, which, by the\r\nhelp of the current, came nearer and nearer to them. The\r\ncreature turned its face, and stared at them, which gave them\r\nan opportunity of examining it narrowly. It stood in the same\r\nplace for seven or eight minutes, and was seen in the water\r\nabove breast-high. At last they grew apprehensive of some\r\ndanger, and began to retire, upon which the monster blew out\r\nits cheeks, and made a kind of lowing noise, diving from\r\ntheir view. In regard to its form, it appeared like an old\r\nman, strong-limbed, with broad shoulders, but its arms they\r\ncould not see. The head was small in proportion to the body,\r\nand it had short curled black hair, which did not reach below\r\nthe ears; the eyes were deep in the head, and it had a meagre\r\nface, with a black beard, about the body downwards; this\r\nmerman was quite pointed like a fish.\r\n\r\nOld Hudson, the navigator, relates: \"This morning, one of\r\nour company looking overboard, saw a mermaid, and calling\r\nup some of the company to see her, one more came up, and by\r\nthat time she was come close to the ship's side, looking earnestly\r\nat the men. A little after, a sea came and overturned her.\r\nFrom the navel up, her back and breasts were like a woman's,\r\nas they say that saw her; her body as big as one of us; her\r\nskin very white, and long hair hanging down behind, of colour\r\nblack. In her going down they saw her tail, which was like\r\nthat of a porpoise, speckled like a mackerel.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Shetland Islands had a belief that\r\nthese supernatural beings possess a sealskin, which serves them\r\nas a charm, and permits them to live in the depths of the\r\nocean; had they not this talisman they would lose their amphibious\r\nqualities. A story is told of a man belonging to Unst,\r\nwho, one day walking along the sands, saw a group of these",
  "p0230.png": "singular beings dancing in the moonlight, and a considerable\r\nnumber of the sealskins lying near them on the shore. Each\r\nwent to pick up its own, and the whole band of mermen and\r\nmermaids disappeared like magic in the sea; but the Shetlander[**P2: Shetlander no space on line P3:corrected]\r\nnoticed one of the skins at his feet, seized it, and hid it\r\nsecurely. On his return he found on the beach the loveliest\r\nmaiden that mortal eyes had ever seen; she was bemoaning\r\nwith many tears the theft which compelled her to remain an\r\nexile on land. In vain did she implore the restitution of her\r\ntalisman, for the man was mad with love, and inexorable,\r\noffering, however, his protection, and a shelter beneath his roof\r\nas his wife. The mermaid, seeing there was no alternative but\r\nto accept, married him. This singular alliance lasted a few\r\nyears, and some children were born, who had no other peculiarity\r\nof appearance, except that the fingers were slightly flattened.\r\nThe wife, however, showed great coldness to her\r\nhusband, and when occasion permitted, she wandered on the\r\nbeach, and at a given signal some one appeared in the sea, with\r\nwhom she kept up a restless conversation in an unknown tongue.\r\nOne day it happened that one of her children accidentally found\r\na sealskin hidden under a mill-wheel, and ran to show it to the\r\nmother. The latter started; her joy was only troubled when\r\nshe looked at the boy, whom she was about to leave for ever.\r\nShe kissed him, and ran at full speed across the sands. At\r\nthis moment the husband returned home, and learned that the\r\nsealskin had been found, and ran to stop his wife; but he arrived\r\nonly to see her transformation in the shape of a seal, and diving\r\nfrom a projecting rock into the sea.\r\n\r\nIn all the northern countries stories relating to mermen and\r\nmermaids are singularly prolific. One common in Sweden tells\r\nhow one night as some fishermen from the farm of Kennare\r\nslept in their wooden huts, the door opened gently, and those\r\nwho were awakened saw a woman's hand, nothing more. This\r\nwas related to their friends the next day, when a reckless young\r\nfellow exclaimed: \"Why did you not lay hold of it? I'll\r\nwatch this evening myself.\" He did so, and when the hand",
  "p0240.png": "appeared he seized it, but was drawn through the door and disappeared.\r\nYears afterwards his wife re-married. The young\r\nman now turned up again, and related how the hand of the\r\nmermaid (for such was the owner of it) had drawn him into the\r\nsea, and how he had lived with her under the water ever since,\r\nuntil one day she said: \"To-night they dance at Kennare.\"\r\nThen he thought to himself that his wife must be re-married,\r\nand the mermaid telling him it was so, added: \"Go and see\r\nyour wife in her bridal wreath, but enter not beneath the roof.\"\r\nHe went ashore, and stood some time looking at the festival,\r\nbut could resist no longer, and entered. That night the roof\r\nof the farm buildings was carried off, and three days afterwards\r\nthe fisherman died.\r\n\r\nIn the \"History of the Netherlands\" there is the following\r\nstrange account of the sea-woman of Haarlem:\r\n\r\n\"At that time there was a great tempest at sea, with exceeding\r\nhigh tides, the which did drowne many villages in Friseland\r\nand Holland; by which tempest there came a sea-woman swimming\r\nin the Zuyderzee betwixt the towns of Campen and\r\nEdam, the which passing by the Purmeric, entered into the\r\nstraight of a broken dyke in the Purmermer, where she remained\r\na long time, and could not find the hole by which she entered,\r\nfor that the breach had been stopped after that the tempest had\r\nceased. Some country women and their servants, who did\r\ndayly pass the Pourmery, to milk their kine in the next pastures,\r\ndid often see this woman swimming on the water, whereof at\r\nthe first they were much afraid; but in the end being accustomed\r\nto see it very often, they viewed it neerer[**nearer?], and at last they resolved\r\nto take it if they could. Having discovered it they\r\nrowed towards it, and drew it out of the water by force, carrying\r\nit in one of their barkes unto the towne of Edam. When\r\nshe had been well washed and cleansed from the sea-moss which\r\nwas grown about her, she was like unto another woman; she\r\nwas appareled, and began to accustome herself to ordinary\r\nmeats like unto any other, yet she sought still means to escape,\r\nand to get into the water, but she was straightly guarded. They",
  "p0250.png": "came from farre to see her. Those of Harlem made great\r\nsute to them of Edam to have this woman by reason of the\r\nstrangenesse thereof. In the end they obtained her, where she\r\ndid learn to spin, and lived many years (some say fifteen), and\r\nfor the reverance which she bare unto the signe of the crosse\r\nwhereunto she had beene accustomed, she was buried in the\r\nchurch-yarde. Many persons worthy of credit have justified\r\nin their writings that they had seene her in the said towne of\r\nHarlem.\"\r\n\r\nOn the western coast of Ireland, at certain rare conjunctions\r\nof wind and tide, there occurs what is called a \"bore.\" The\r\nfishermen being totally ignorant of its actual cause, for it takes\r\nplace in but one bay, and at remote intervals, called it an\r\n\"avenging wave,\" and gave a terrible description of its rushing\r\nalong crested with lightnings. Their account of its origin is\r\nthis. A man of the name of Shea, a fisherman, once killed a\r\nmermaid, though she begged hard for mercy. The very next\r\ntime that he sailed on the bay, the waves appeared in all their\r\nterrors. Struck by a guilty conscience he fled towards land;\r\nbut the incredible speed of the \"avenger\" could not be baffled,\r\nhe was overtaken, and not only he, but all in his boat perished.\r\nThe punishment did not end there. Even to a later period the\r\nappearance of any of his direct descendants roused the same\r\nwave or \"bore.\" Its desire of vengeance, or its power, somewhat\r\ndiminished afterwards, for if the fishermen perceived it in\r\ntime, and crossed the bar, they were secure.\r\n\r\nIn the Icelandic chronicles it is stated that there were seen\r\nin the sea of Greenland three sea-monsters of enormous size.\r\nThe first, which some Norwegians saw from the waist upwards\r\nout of the water, was like a man about the neck, head, face,\r\nnose, and mouth, with the exception of the head being very\r\nmuch elevated and pointed towards the top. Its shoulders\r\nwere broad, and at their extremity were two stumps of arms\r\nwithout hands. The body was slender below, and its look was\r\nchilling. There were heavy storms each time the monster appeared\r\nabove the water. The second monster was formed down",
  "p0260.png": "to the waist like a woman; it had large breasts, disheveled hair,\r\nand huge hands at the ends of the stumps of the arms, with\r\nlong fingers, webbed like the feet of a duck. It was seen\r\nholding fish in its hand, and eating them. This phantom\r\nalways preceded some storm. If it plunges in the water with\r\nits face towards the sailors, it is a sign they will not be shipwrecked;\r\nbut if it turns its back to them, they are lost. The\r\nthird monster had three large heads.\r\n\r\nScoresby, in his account of the Arctic Regions, says that\r\nwhen seen at a distance, the front pan of the head of a young\r\nwalrus without tusks is not unlike a human face. As this\r\nanimal is in the habit of rearing its head above water to look\r\nat ships and other passing objects, it is not at all improbable\r\nthat it may have afforded some foundation for the stories of\r\nmermaids. \"I have myself,\" he remarks, \"seen a sea-horse\r\nin such a position, and under such circumstances, that it required\r\nvery little stretch of imagination to mistake it for a\r\nhuman being; so like indeed was it, that the surgeon of the\r\nship actually reported to me his having seen a man with his\r\nhead just appearing above the water.\"\r\n\r\nColumbus in his \"Journal\" relates having seen three\r\nmermaids, which elevated themselves above the surface of the\r\nsea, and he adds that he had before seen such on the coast of\r\nAfrica. They were by no means the beautiful beings that are\r\ngenerally represented, although they had some traces of the\r\nhuman countenance. It is supposed that these must have\r\nbeen manati, or sea-calves, seen indistinctly or at a distance,\r\nand that the imagination of Columbus, disposed to give a\r\nwonderful character to everything in this New World, had\r\nidentified these misshapen animals with the syrens of ancient\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThe Russian popular mythology has, of course, its Vodyany,\r\nor water-sprite. \"Here,\" remarks Mr. Ralston in his interesting\r\nwork on the \"Songs of the Russian Peasants,\" \"is one of\r\nthe stories about a mixed marriage beneath the waves. Except\r\nat the end, it is very like that which forms the groundwork of",
  "p0270.png": "Mr. Matthew Arnold's exquisite romaunt of the 'Forsaken\r\nMerman.' 'Once upon a time a girl was drowned, and she\r\nlived for many years after that with a water-sprite. But one\r\nfine day she swam to the shore, and saw the red sun and the\r\ngreen woods and fields, and heard the humming of insects and\r\nthe distant sound of church-bells. Then a longing after her\r\nold life on earth came over her, and she could not resist the\r\ntemptation. So she came out from the water, and went to\r\nher native village. But there, neither her relatives nor friends\r\nrecognised her. Sadly did she return in the evening to the\r\nwater-side, and passed once more to the power of the water-sprite.\r\nTwo days later, her mutilated corse[**P2: corpse] floated on the sands.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a water-sprite appears in a village, it is easy to recognise\r\nhim; for water is always dripping from his left skirt, and the\r\nspot on which he sits becomes instantly wet. In his own\r\nrealm he not only rules over all the fishes that swim, but he\r\ngreatly influences the lot of fishers and mariners. Sometimes\r\nhe brings them good-luck--sometimes he lures them to destruction.\r\nSometimes he gets caught in nets; but he immediately\r\ntears them asunder, and all the fish that had been inclosed\r\nwith him, swim after him.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, fishermen are afraid of assisting a drowning\r\nman, thinking the water-sprite will be offended, and will drive\r\naway the fish from their nets; and they say he often sits on the\r\nshore with a club in his hand, from which hang ribbons of\r\nvarious hues: with these he allures children, and those he gets\r\nhold of he drowns. The souls of his victims he keeps, making\r\nthem his servants, but their bodies he allows to float to shore.\r\nSometimes he changes himself into a fish, generally a pike.\r\nSometimes, also, he is represented like the Western merman,\r\nwith a fish's tail. In the Ukraine there is a tradition that,\r\nwhen the sea is rough, such half-fishy \"marine people\" appear\r\non the surface of the water and sing songs. In other places\r\nthey are called \"Pharaohs,\" being supposed, like the seals in\r\nIceland, to be the remains of that host of Pharaoh which\r\nperished in the Red Sea.",
  "p0280.png": "\r\nThe tradition of the Russian peasants speak of the Tsar\r\nMoskoi, the Marine or Water-King, who dwells in the depths\r\nof the sea, or the lake, or the pool, and who rules over the\r\nsubaqueous world. To this Slavonic Neptune a family of\r\ndaughters is frequently attributed, maidens of exceeding\r\nbeauty, who, when they don their feather dresses, become the\r\nSwan Maidens who figure in the popular legends of so many\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe following ballad of \"Duke Magnus and the Mermaid,\"\r\nis from Smaland. Magnus was the youngest son of Gustavus\r\nVasa. He died out of his mind. It is well known that\r\ninsanity pervaded the Vasa family for centuries:\r\n\r\n\"Duke Magnus looked out from the castle window,\r\nHow the stream ran so rapidly;\r\nAnd there he saw how upon the stream sat\r\nA woman most fair and lovely.\r\nDuke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,\r\nI pray you still so freely;\r\nSay me not nay, but yes! yes!\r\n\r\n\"O, to you I will give a travelling ship,\r\nThe best that a knight would guide;\r\nIt goeth as well on water as on fair land,\r\nAnd through the fields all so wide.\r\nDuke Magnus, etc.\r\n\r\n\"O, to you I will give a courser grey,\r\nThe best that a knight would ride;\r\nHe goeth as well on water as firm land,\r\nAnd through the groves all so wide.\r\nDuke Magnus, etc.\r\n\r\n\"O, how shall I plight me to you?\r\nI never any quiet get;\r\nI serve the king and my native land,\r\nBut with woman I match me not yet.\r\nDuke Magnus, etc.\r\n\r\n\"To you I will give as much of gold\r\nAs far more than your life will endure;\r\nAnd of pearls and precious stones handfuls,\r\nAnd all shall be so pure.\r\nDuke Magnus, etc.\r\n\r\n\"O, gladly would I plight me to thee,\r\nIf thou wert of Christian kind;\r\nBut now thou art a vile sea-troll,\r\nMy love thou canst never win.\r\nDuke Magnus, etc.",

Presently the waters of the lake were troubled, and the\r\nTsar Moskoi appeared, who thanked him for his music, and\r\npromised a rich reward. Thereupon Sadko flung a net into\r\nthe lake, and drew a great treasure to land. Another of the\r\npoems tells how the same Sadko, after he had become a wealthy\r\nmerchant, was sailing over the blue sea. Presently his ship\r\nstopped, and nothing would make it move on. Lots were cast\r\nto find out whose guilt was the cause of this delay, and they\r\nfixed the blame on Sadko. Then he confessed that he had\r\nnow been sailing to and fro for twelve years, but had not\r\nremembered to pay fitting tribute to the King of the Waters--to\r\noffer bread and salt to the blue Caspian. Thereupon the\r\nsailors flung him overboard, and immediately the ship proceeded\r\non its way. Sadko sank to the bottom of the sea, and\r\nthere found a dwelling entirely made of wood. Inside lay the\r\nTsar Moskoi, who said he had been expecting Sadko for twelve\r\nyears, and told him to begin playing. Sadko obeyed and\r\ncharmed the Tsar, who began to dance. Then the blue sea\r\nwas troubled, the swift rivers overflowed, and many ships with\r\ntheir freight were submerged. The Ocean King was so pleased\r\nwith the music that he offered the hand of any one of his thirty\r\ndaughters to the musician, who married the nymph Volkhof;\r\nthat being the name of the river which runs past Novgorod.",
  "p0300.png": "\r\nAmong the Indian tribes of Guiana, there is an important\r\nbeing in their mythology called the Orehu, a mysterious female\r\ninhabiting the waters. Though not decidedly malignant, she\r\nis very capricious, and consequently dreaded. Her supposed\r\nform agrees with that of the ordinary mermaid, but she sometimes\r\npresents herself above the water, with the head of a horse\r\nor other animal, as may suit her fancy or the object she has\r\nin view. She often amuses herself with terrifying mankind; but\r\nsometimes bears canoe and people to the bottom. There was\r\na spot on the banks of the Pomeroon where the earth, being\r\nundermined by the current, had sunk, and the trees which\r\nformerly flourished there stood out of the water withered and\r\nbare, presenting a desolate appearance. That was supposed\r\nto be a favourite resort of the Orehu. Many, especially of the\r\nWarans, an Indian tribe, if compelled to pass the spot by\r\nnight, would keep close to the opposite bank and glide with\r\nnoiseless paddles past the place where the water-sprite was\r\nbelieved to have fixed her abode. The superstitious belief\r\nconcerning this being prevailed also among the black people\r\ndwelling on the rivers of Guiana. One of the Obia dances of\r\nthe blacks is commonly called the water-mama dance, from\r\nthe appellation usually given by them to their adopted\r\npatroness, the Orehu of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe occasional appearance above the surface of the waters\r\nof the Manati, or Water-Cow, is supposed to have given rise to\r\nthis superstition in former days. But, however that may be,\r\nthe Indians have for ages drawn a wide distinction between\r\nthe \"Orehu\" and the \"Koiamoora,\" or Manati, believing\r\nthem to differ in nature as in name. The Orehu, according\r\nto their notions, may assume the figure of the Manati, as of\r\nany other animal, but the latter does not, in their belief, possess\r\nany supernatural power, and is eaten when captured.\r\n\r\nFAIRIES, water-spirits, and kelpies had a share in bewildering\r\nthe feeble minds of sailors in olden times. In Perthshire\r\nevery lake had its kelpie, or water-horse, often seen dashing",
  "p0310.png": "along the surface of the water. This malignant genius was supposed\r\nto allure women and children to his subaqueous haunts,\r\nthere to be immediately devoured. He would also swell the\r\ntorrent beyond its usual limits to overwhelm the hapless traveller.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of Dieppe had a tradition that the fairies, at a\r\ncertain season of the year, held a bazaar on the cliffs overhanging\r\nthe sea, where articles of unequalled rarity and beauty were\r\noffered for sale. The passing fisherman on these occasions was\r\naccosted by these strange beings, who employed every art of\r\nfascination to draw his attention to their wares. If he had\r\nsufficient firmness to avert his gaze from the brilliant spectacle,\r\nhe escaped uninjured; but if he yielded to the delusion, or\r\nlistened to the delicious music that swelled around, all self-control\r\nwas lost, and pursuing the glittering bait, which receded\r\nbefore him, he was drawn to the edge of the precipice, and\r\nhurled into the waves beneath.\r\n\r\nI have ventured a ballad on this subject:\r\n\r\n'Twas the eve of the bridal of Claude Deloraine,\r\nThe boldest of fishers who travers'd the main,\r\nWith the heart and the brow that had won him the hand\r\nOf a maiden, the fairest and best in the land.\r\n\r\nStill was the hour--the stars shone above,\r\nAs Claude bounded homeward, his thoughts full of love,\r\nWith a song on his lips, and a step light and free\r\nAs the waves that had rock'd him that day on the sea.\r\n\r\nOn, onward, he went; but it seem'd to his gaze\r\nThat the falaise grew longer; perchance 'twas the haze;\r\nWhen, sudden, there gleam'd on his pathway a light,\r\nThat eclips'd the full moon in the glory of night.\r\n\r\nAnd there rose in the midst, with a speed like the wind,\r\nA mart of rich splendour, unmatch'd of its kind,\r\nAll the marvels of Stamboul in vain could compare\r\nWith the treasures of art that lay clustering there.\r\n\r\nBut bright though the jewels, how lovelier far\r\nShone the eyes of the elves--each the ray of a star,\r\nAs playful, and graceful, the gay creatures came\r\nTo the side of poor Claude, and breath'd softly his name.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, young fisher, and buy from our store;\r\nWe have pearls from the deep, and earth's costliest ore:\r\nThy bride is awaiting some gift from thee now,\r\nTake a chaplet of pearls to encircle her brow.\"",
  "p0320.png": "\r\nSoft fell the voice on the calm summer's even,\r\nThe herald of strains that seem'd wafted from heaven;\r\nSo thrilling, the heart of the sailor gave way,\r\nAnd he look'd, with charm'd eyes, on the fairies' array!\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" cried the elves, as the bridegroom drew near,\r\n\"The willows look greener when wet with a tear;\r\nThere's a boat on the wave, but no helmsman to guide,\r\nThere's an arm on the cold beach, but pulseless its pride!\"\r\n\r\nAs the lights mov'd before him, Claude hasten'd along;\r\nHe marked not his footsteps; he heard but the song:\r\nOne moment--it ceas'd--midst the silence of death\r\nThe sailor was hurl'd in the breakers beneath!\r\n\r\nA droll legend of a fisherman and the piskies, or little people,\r\nhow, with true Cornish keenness, he over-reached the fairies, is\r\nrelated by Mr. Couch, of Penzance. It seems that John\r\nTaprail, long since dead, moored his boat one evening beside\r\na barge of much larger size, in which his neighbour John\r\nRendle traded between Cornwall and Plymouth; and as the\r\nwind, though gusty, was not sufficient to cause any apprehension,\r\nhe went to bed and slept soundly. In the middle of the\r\nnight he was woke by a voice from without bidding him get up\r\nand \"shift his rope over Rendle's,\" as his boat was in considerable\r\ndanger. Now, as all Taprail's capital was invested in his\r\nboat and gear, we may be sure that he was not long in putting\r\non his sea-clothes and going to its rescue. To his great chagrin\r\nhe found that a joke had been played upon him, for the boat\r\nand barge were both riding quietly at their rope. On his way\r\nback again, when within a few yards of his home, he observed\r\na crowd of the little people congregated under the shelter of a\r\nboat that was lying high and dry upon the beach. They were\r\nsitting in a semicircle, holding their hats to one of their\r\nnumber, who was engaged in distributing a heap of money,\r\npitching a gold piece into the hat of each in succession, after\r\nthe manner in which cards are dealt. Now, John had a\r\ncovetous heart, and the sight of so much cash made him forget\r\nthe respect due to an assembly of piskies, and that they are not\r\nslow to punish any intrusion on their privacy; so he crept slily\r\ntowards them, hidden by the boat, and reaching round, managed",
  "p0330.png": "to introduce his hat without exciting any notice. When the\r\nheap was getting low, and Taprail was awaking to the dangers\r\nof detection, he craftily withdrew his hat, and made off with\r\nthe prize. He had got a fair start before the trick was discovered,\r\nbut the defrauded piskies were soon on his heels, and\r\nhe barely managed to reach his house, and to close the door\r\nupon his pursuers. So narrow indeed was his escape that he\r\nhad left the tails of his sea-coat in their hands.\r\n\r\nSuch is evidently the very imperfect version of an old legend\r\nas it is remembered by the Cornish fishermen of the present\r\ngeneration. We may suppose that John Taprail's door had a\r\nkey-hole, and there would have been poetical justice in the\r\nstory, if the elves had compelled the fraudulent fisherman to\r\nturn his hat, or his pocket, inside out.\r\n\r\nThe French sailors formerly dreaded the nocturnal visits of\r\na goblin, a sort of mischievous Puck, who played his pranks on\r\nboard while they slept: opened the knives in their pockets,\r\nsinged their hair, tied up the cords that held the sails, drew up\r\nanchors in a calm, and tore in pieces the sails that had been\r\ncarelessly tied by the sailors; in the latter case proving\r\ncertainly a retributory monitor.\r\n\r\nSir George Grey, in his \"Polynesian Mythology,\" observes\r\nthat the New Zealanders learnt the art of netting mackerel from\r\nthe fairies. It was a certain Kahakura, whose observation of\r\nthe habits of his race was sufficiently acute to discover this\r\ndevice. Passing a place where some people had been cleaning\r\nmackerel, he remarked that the people who had been fishing\r\nmust have been there in the night-time, and he said to himself,\r\n\"These are no mortals who have been fishing here; spirits\r\nmust have done this. Had they been men, some of the reeds\r\nand grass which they sit upon in their canoe would have been\r\nlying about.\" Keeping his own counsel, he returned to watch\r\non the following night; and, sure enough there were the fairies,\r\nshouting out, \"The net here--the net here!\" and other encouraging\r\ncries. In the darkness, Kahakura managed to lend\r\na hand in hauling in the nets; and in the collection and appro-*",
  "p0340.png": "*priation of the fish, availed himself of a crafty ruse to delay his\r\ncompanions from time to time, until the daylight broke. The\r\nfairies, when they saw that Kahakura was a man, dispersed in\r\nconfusion, leaving their nets, the construction of which Kahakura\r\ncould study at leisure. He thus taught his children to\r\nmake nets, and by them the Maori race became acquainted\r\nwith the art.\r\n\r\nFROM early times the Virgin and saints were believed to\r\nexercise a miraculous influence over the destinies of\r\nseamen; and a like sentiment still prevails over the maritime\r\npopulation of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nTwo Varangian chiefs, Askold and Dir, began the expeditions\r\nagainst Byzantium. With two hundred vessels, says Nestor, they\r\nentered the Sound (the Bosphorus), and besieged Constantinople.\r\nBut the patriarch Photius, according to the Byzantine accounts,\r\ntook the wonder-working robe of Our Lady of Blachernes, and\r\nplunged it into the waves. A fierce tempest instantly arose,\r\nand the whole Russian fleet was destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe are told (in the beginning of the eleventh century) that\r\nwhen \u00c6thelsige set sail from Denmark on his return to England,\r\nhis ship was well-nigh lost in a storm. In answer to the\r\nprayers of the abbot and his companions, an angel presently\r\nappeared, and bade them keep the Feast of the Conception of\r\nOur Lady. On his vow so to do, the storm ceased, and on his\r\nreturn the new festival was first kept in the church of Ramsey,\r\nand from thence its observance spread over England and\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nIn 1226, the Earl of Salisbury, on returning to England, was\r\nso nearly shipwrecked on his voyage, that everything, including\r\narticles of great value, were thrown into the sea to lighten the\r\nship. In the moment of supreme danger a brilliant light was\r\nseen at the top of the mast, and near to it a damsel of surpassing\r\nbeauty, who protected the light from the wind and rain.\r\nThis sight inspired the earl and the sailors with courage, and\r\nthe presence was assumed to be that of the Virgin, to whom",
  "p0350.png": "the earl, from the day of his knighthood, had devoted a taper\r\nto be burnt at her shrine constantly during canonical hours.\r\n\r\nEdward III., after the surrender of Calais, on his return to\r\nEngland, encountered a violent storm. \"Oh, blessed Mary!\"\r\nhe exclaimed; \"holy lady! why is it, and what does it portend,\r\nthat in going to France I enjoyed a favourable wind, a calm\r\nsea, and all things prospered with me; but on returning to\r\nEngland, all kinds of misfortunes befall me?\" Of course the\r\nmonkish historians relate that this expostulation had the desired\r\neffect, and the storm suddenly subsided.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV. in England\"\r\n(Camden Society), we read: \"The kynge, beinge out of his\r\nrealme, in great trowble, thowght, and hevines, for the infortwne\r\nand adversitie that was fallen hym, full often, and specially\r\nupon the sea, he prayed to God, owr Lady, and Seint George,\r\nand, amonges othar saynts, he specially prayed Seint Anne to\r\nhelpe hym, where that he promysed, that, at the next tyme that\r\nit shuld hape hym to se any ymage of Seint Anne, he shuld\r\ntherto make his prayers, and gyve his offeringe, in the honor\r\nand worshipe of that blessyd saynte.\"\r\n\r\nJoinville relates that a sailor falling overboard during the\r\nvoyage of St. Louis to France, on being picked up, was asked:\r\n\"Why he didn't swim?\" He replied that he had no need to\r\ndo so, for while falling into the sea, he exclaimed: \"Our Lady\r\nof Valbert,\" and that she had supported him by his shoulders\r\nuntil he was taken aboard.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sir Henry Howard wrote to King Henry VIII. from\r\nsea: \"I have given him (Captain Arthur) liberty to go home,\r\nfor when he was in extreme danger, he called upon Our Lady\r\nof Walsingham for health and comfort, and made a vow that\r\nan it pleased God and her to deliver him out of the peril, he\r\nwould never eat flesh or fish until he had seen her.\"\r\n\r\nFynes Moryson, in his \"Travels,\" mentions having seen an\r\nimage of the Virgin Mary at Venice, to which great miracles\r\nwere attributed. All ships that came into the haven used to\r\nsalute this image and that of St. Mark, by firing guns. A mer-*",
  "p0360.png": "*chant of Venice, saved from shipwreck by the light of a candle\r\non a dark night, in his last will ordered that his heirs should for\r\never cause a wax candle to be burnt before the image.\r\n\r\nIn Leo Antonio More's \"Description of Africa\" (1600) is a\r\ncurious legend of saintly interposition at sea. Alluding to the\r\nconsecration of Venice to St. Mark the Evangelist (A.D. 829),\r\nhe says it became possessed of certain relics of the saint by a\r\npious fraud. The Caliph of Egypt was building at Alexandria\r\na new palace, and decorating it with the spoils of the Christian\r\nchurches. As it was feared that the body of St. Mark would\r\nshare in the general desecration, two Venetian merchants, who\r\nwere then trading in the Egyptian ports with ten galleys, bribed\r\nthe chief priest of the temple to hand over to them the body\r\nfor transference to Venice. It was necessary to conceal the\r\ncontemplated theft from the Christian population, and for this\r\npurpose the body of St. Claudia was deposited in the linen\r\nshroud occupied by the evangelist. Such, however, was the\r\nsuperior sanctity of the latter, that the disturbance of his\r\nremains filled the whole church with a rich celestial odour,\r\nand attracted crowds of curious devotees to satisfy themselves\r\nof the safety of the holy treasure. They did not detect the\r\nchange that had been effected. During the homeward voyage\r\na terrible storm would have destroyed the vessel and all its\r\ncrew, but for the timely appearance of the saint, who ordered\r\nthe captain to furl his sails, thereby proving himself a better\r\nnavigator than the Venetian.\r\n\r\nThe Sardinian fishermen appear to indulge in a plurality of\r\nsaints to favour their vocation. Tyndale, in his account of that\r\nisland, gives an animated description of the superstitious observances\r\nof the sailors. \"Amidst the cheers,\" he says, \"of the\r\nfishermen, at having made a good capture of fish, a general\r\nsilence prevailed, the leader in his little boat having checked\r\nthe hilarity, and assumed a pontifical as well as a piscatorial\r\ncharacter. Taking off his cap--an example followed by all his\r\ncompany--he commenced a half-chaunt, or half-recitative\r\nprayer, a species of litany and invocation of the saints, to which",
  "p0370.png": "an ora pro nobis chorus was made by the sailors. After the\r\nVirgin Mary had been appealed to, and her protection against\r\naccidents particularly requested--as the ancients did to Neptune--several\r\nsaints were called over, half of whose names I\r\nknew not, but who were evidently influential persons in the fishing\r\ndepartment. St. George was supplicated to drive away all\r\nenemies of the tunny, from the imaginary \"lammia,\" or sorceress,\r\nto the real shark and sword-fish. St. Peter was reminded of\r\nthe holy miracle performed for him, by an application to effect\r\na similarly miraculous draught on the present occasion, and\r\n(perhaps to counterbalance the difficulty in case of his refusal)\r\na petition was offered up to San Antonio di Padua, imploring\r\nhim to perform some more of his fishing wonders. St. Michael\r\nwas complimented on his heavenly influence in these matters,\r\nand humbly requested to continue his favours. Not knowing\r\nwhy the latter was mixed up with the affair, I asked one of the\r\nmen for an explanation, and his answer was as learned as it was\r\nlucid. \"St. Michael,\" he said, \"was with St. Peter, when the\r\nlatter asked Jesus Christ to go fishing, and he was, therefore,\r\none of the crew of that boat.\" Besides the saints of such undoubted\r\nauthority and interest in tunny fishing, the shrines of\r\ngeneral saints, as well as local ones, were called over, and a\r\nblessing requested for the particular towns and places in the\r\nMediterranean, which purchased the fish.\r\n\r\nDuring these pious appeals, so cunning and amusing to a\r\nProtestant stranger, the preparations for killing the fish were not\r\nforgotten, the men having changed their clothes for the occasion;\r\nfor by the time the carnage was over, the men were\r\ncovered with blood, the stain of which it is almost impossible to\r\nremove. The change of every jacket, waistcoat, and trousers,\r\nseemed to produce a corresponding one in the litany, and one\r\nmight have imagined that the saints presided no less over the old\r\nclothes than over the tunnies. The next day, the weather being\r\nunpropitious, a fresh invocation of the saints was made in church\r\nat vespers, and fishermen and others were assembled to implore\r\na change of wind, and a successful fishing on the morrow.",
  "p0380.png": "\r\nAccording to Cetti, it is a custom of the Italian seamen on\r\nthe vigils of a particular day, to draw by lot the name of a saint,\r\nand thus elected to constitute and invoke him as the protector\r\nand patron for the time; and he is paid for the trouble and\r\nhonour by a present of one of the largest fish, which the priest\r\nobligingly takes care of in his own larder.\r\n\r\nThe saints in turbulent times took good care of their own\r\nhonour by miraculous interpositions; thus we read that during\r\nthe strife between the Scots and English in 1335, the fleet of\r\nthe latter entered the Forth, and committed great ravages on\r\nthe sea-coast. One of these piratical vessels landed on the\r\nisland of Amonia, and despoiling a church, carried off a splendid\r\nimage of St. Colomba. While on their return, however, the\r\nsaint took vengeance upon them, for a furious storm arose, and\r\none of the largest ships nearly foundered. Having reached\r\nInchkeith in great distress, and implored the forgiveness of the\r\nsaint, they suddenly found themselves in safety, but not until\r\na vow had been made that the image should be replaced in its\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\nAnother ship of the same expedition robbed the church of\r\nDolas, and took away the choir, a piece of curious workmanship;\r\nbut the crime did not pass unpunished, for the barge\r\nwhich was conveying the choir, and while the sailors were exulting\r\nwith trumpets and horns, suddenly sunk.\r\n\r\nThorlack, a Swedish bishop, when forced to leave Upsala,\r\nstole the finger-bone of the holy Erik, to secure a favourable\r\nwind. A dreadful storm, however, arose; so, repenting of his\r\nsacrilege, he took back the relic, and then, with a fair breeze,\r\nthe vessel went quietly on.\r\n\r\nA similar legend is recorded in the annals of the Abbey of\r\nF\u00e9camp in Normandy. A monk named Gualtier had been\r\nreceived into the monastery about the year 1201. On the pretext\r\nof taking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, he stole a portion of\r\nthe \"holy blood,\" which relic rendered the abbey so famous in\r\nolden time. Besides this, he purloined a bone of the arm of\r\nSt. Madelaine. With these the monk quitted the abbey, and,",
  "p0390.png": "in company with two other priests, embarked on board a ship.\r\nGualtier assured the crew that they would have a favourable\r\nvoyage, as he was the bearer of some precious relics. The\r\ncontrary, however, took place; a violent tempest frightened all\r\non board, and Gualtier was reminded of his boast. He avowed\r\nthe theft, but declared his intention of raising a chapel at Jerusalem,\r\nin honour of the precious relics. After this the wind\r\nabated, and the sea became calm. The sailors who had witnessed\r\nthe miracle, endeavoured to obtain the relics by force;\r\nbut it was resolved, at length, that they should be restored to\r\nthe abbey, and on this conclusion the vessel returned safely to\r\nF\u00e9camp.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the \"Rhyming Chronicle of Sweden,\" that\r\nbefore the taking of Wisby, Erik (not the saint) and his piratical\r\ncompanions, repenting of their sins, came to Bro Church, and\r\nkneeling on the stone pavement before the cross, offered, as\r\ngifts, plunder taken from the Swedish merchants. An unseen\r\nhand kindled their offerings as they lay upon the altar, and fire\r\nconsumed them, while not even the altar-cloth was singed. The\r\nimages of the martyred saints swelled, and dropped blood upon\r\nthe floor. Thus the pirates understood that heaven rejected\r\ntheir gifts, and that some punishment was at hand, which really\r\nhappened; the ships of Erik being wrecked, and all their\r\ntreasures lost, while the chief himself was nearly drowned.\r\n\r\nThe miraculous powers of St. Nicholas, the patron of seamen,\r\nseem to have been confined to no particular country or occasion.[*]\r\nThe church of this worthy, at Arboja in Sweden, had\r\nbefore the Reformation a richly-carved altar-piece, concerning\r\n\r\n* According to the Scandinavian mythology, Odin assumes the name of\r\nNick, Neck, Nikkar, Nickur, or Hnikar, when he acts as the evil or\r\ndestructive principle. In the character of Nikur, or Hnikudur, a Protean\r\nwater-sprite, he raised sudden storms and tempests. Nick, or Nickar, was\r\npropitiated by sacrifices, and hence it has been imagined that the Scandinavian\r\nspirit of the waters became in the middle ages St. Nicholas. The\r\ncorrespondence of these two sea-protectors with those ascribed to the marine\r\ndeities of Greece and Rome, is the consequence of their common origin in\r\nthe mysteries of the Cabiri, or the great gods of Ph\u0153nicia, Samothrace,\r\nEgypt, Troas, Greece, Italy, and Crete. Of these were Castor and Pollux.",
  "p0400.png": "which a tradition is related, that during some foreign war the\r\ninhabitants of a besieged town sewed this splendid work of art in\r\na cow-hide, and sunk it in the sea to prevent their enemies from\r\nobtaining possession of it. The Swedes, however, discovered\r\nthe spot, but in trying to hoist the weighty load into a ship, they\r\nfound that it could not be moved. A sagacious bystander suggested\r\nthat they should call over the names of the great\r\nchurches in Sweden, for if by chance they came upon the name\r\nof the patron saint of the altar-piece, it could surely be moved.\r\nThe bright idea was acted upon, and St. Laurentius of Lund\r\nwas invoked, but without effect, the altar-piece sticking as firm\r\nas ever. Saint after saint--nearly all in the calendar, were\r\ncalled upon with the same result; but at length a sailor boy\r\nsuggested St. Nicholas, when up came the altar-piece like a\r\ncork, and was sent to the church of Arboja, of which he was the\r\ntutelary guardian.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Nicholas at Liverpool was consecrated in\r\n1361, \"and,\" remarks Mr. Baines, \"in the vicinity there formerly\r\nstood a statue of St. Nicholas, and when the faith in the intercession\r\nof saints was more operative than at present, the\r\nmariners were wont to present a peace-offering for a prosperous\r\nvoyage on their going out to sea, and a wave-offering on their\r\nreturn; but the saint, having lost his votaries, has long since\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\nTo these churches, in many countries, mariners offered\r\nup their prayers, and hung up votive tablets. One in the\r\n\"Absurda\" of Erasmus, having escaped shipwreck, says that\r\nhe is proceeding forthwith to the church, in order to dedicate a\r\npiece of an old sail-cloth to St. Nicholas.\r\n\r\nLambarde in his \"Perambulations of Kent,\" alluding to St.\r\nNicholas's Chapel, near Hythe, remarks: \"This is one of the\r\nplaces--\r\n\r\n\"[**P3 no closing \"]'Where such as had escapt the sea\r\nWere wont to leave their guifts.'\r\n\r\nInsomuch, as if any of the fishermen on this coast had hardly\r\nescaped the storme, and taken any store, then should Sainct",
  "p0410.png": "Nicholas have not onely the thanke of that deliverance, but, also,\r\none or more of the best fishes for an offering.\"\r\n\r\nThe custom of suspending tablets is probably derived from\r\nthe Romans, who had it from the Greeks, for we are told that\r\nBion, the philosopher, was shown several of these votive\r\npictures, suspended in a temple of Neptune upon the sea-shore.\r\nCicero briefly notices this custom, and Horace describes it:\r\n\r\n\"Me tabula sacer\r\nVotiva paries indicat avida\r\nSuspendisse potenti,\r\nVestimenta maris Deo.\"\r\n\r\nA friend of Diagoras, the philosopher, in order to convince\r\nhim that the gods were not indifferent to human affairs, desired\r\nhim to observe how many consecrated tablets were hung up in\r\nthe temple in grateful acknowledgments of the escapes from\r\nthe dangers of the sea. Diagoras, in reply, said: \"True, but\r\nhere are no tablets of those who have suffered shipwreck, and\r\nperished in the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans it was customary to consecrate little\r\nmarble ships to Jupiter Redux, in gratitude for their safe return\r\nfrom sea. On the C\u0153lian Hill, where anciently stood the\r\ntemple of this deity, Our Lady of the Ship, Santa Maria della\r\nNavicella, now receives the homage of her naval votaries.\r\nBefore her chapel, Pope Leo X. erected a marble ship to record\r\nthe dangers he had escaped in a storm at sea. Fragments of\r\nancient votive ships have often been discovered in the soil of\r\nthis spot.\r\n\r\nIt seems singular that an Egyptian goddess, Isis, whose\r\ngenuine worshippers at home held the sea and everything connected\r\nwith it in abhorrence, should be fixed upon at Rome,\r\nfor the tutelar[**tutelary on 0440.png] power of that element, and have her altars\r\ncrowned with votive tablets. Anciently these were hung up to\r\nNeptune; but it was not only on his prerogative she trenched,\r\nbut on those of Apollo, Esculapius, etc. The tablets which\r\nmen in danger of shipwreck vowed to Isis, and which they\r\nprocured to be painted and hung up in her temple, contained",
  "p0420.png": "a representation of their perils and escapes. Thus Juvenal\r\n(Satire xii.) says:\r\n\r\n\"As Isis's temples show\r\nBy many a pictured scene of votive woe.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern mariners of Greece substitute St. Nicholas for\r\nNeptune, and an interesting historical anecdote is connected\r\nwith the subject. The name of Kanaris, the Greek naval hero,\r\nwas almost unknown among his fellow-countrymen, until he\r\nsignalised himself in January, 1828, by setting fire to the\r\nTurkish admiral's ship, which had a crew of 2,200 men on\r\nboard at the time in the roads of Chios. His own men, on\r\ndescrying the great Turkish fleet in that roadstead, attempted to\r\ncompel him to sheer off. \"If you have coward hearts,\"\r\nexclaimed Kanaris, \"throw yourselves into the sea, and shelter\r\nyourselves behind yon rocks. I shall remain on board and die\r\nwithout you.\" These words recalled their sinking courage, and\r\nthey swore to live or die with him. It happened to be the\r\nmonth of Ramazan, when the faithful, after keeping their\r\nmouths closed from sunrise to sunset, retaliate for the penance\r\nby passing the night in all kinds of merriment and debauchery.\r\nThe night in question had, therefore, collected a host of officers\r\nof considerable rank on board the admiral's ship as visitors. It\r\nwas pitch dark when Kanaris made his fire-ship fast to the\r\nvessel, set fire to her, and jumped into his launch; the flames\r\nspread rapidly, and Kanaris, who was at no great distance from\r\nthe enemy, called out to them, \"Holloa there! how do you\r\nrelish the Ramazan illumination?\" Then laying his best hands\r\nto the oar, he beheld the Turkish admiral's ship with the\r\nKapudan Pasha, and every soul on board blown into the air.\r\nAs soon as the hero got ashore, he went to St. Nicholas's\r\nChurch, where he returned the saint thanksgivings, and presented\r\na votive offering of two wax tapers to his shrine.\r\n\r\nAn instance of a partnership of saints for the protection of\r\nmariners is recorded. At the time of the Crusades, a fleet of\r\nships, conveying troops, set sail from Dartmouth in 1190, to\r\njoin Richard I. at Marseilles, but were dispersed on their way",
  "p0430.png": "during a violent gale. To one of these vessels, which belonged\r\nto London, and had one hundred passengers, a special miracle\r\nwas vouchsafed. The terrified crew having invoked divine aid,\r\nSt. Thomas of Canterbury thrice appeared, and assured them\r\nthat he and St. Edmund and St. Nicholas had agreed to protect\r\ntheir ship, and would preserve it in safety, provided the\r\npassengers repented of their sins, and would do penance. Such\r\neasy terms being gladly accepted by the company, the saint\r\nvanished, and the tempest ceased.\r\n\r\nNumberless are the instances of saintly interposition on\r\nbehalf of seamen in peril, and sometimes under strange circumstances.\r\nThus we are told of a Mahommedan miracle. A\r\ncertain person's ship sprung a leak at sea, and the vessel was\r\nnearly sinking, when the captain vowed with a sincere heart\r\nthat should Qadir Wullee-Sahib (a celebrated saint and prophet)\r\nvouchsafe to stop the leak, he would offer up in his excellency's\r\nname the profits of his cargo, and likewise a couple of small\r\nmodels of ships formed of gold and silver. It happened at that\r\nperilous moment the saint was engaged with his barber, undergoing\r\nthe process of shaving, but he instantly became acquainted\r\nwith the condition in which the captain stood. Out of kindness\r\nhe threw away the looking-glass he held in his hand, which flew\r\noff to the vessel, and adhering to the aperture in the ship,\r\nstopped the leak. The vessel reached its destination safely,\r\nand the captain, remindful of his promise, brought his offering\r\nin gold, and the two little vessels of gold and silver to the\r\nsaint, who told him to restore the looking-glass to the barber.\r\nThe captain, astonished, inquired what looking-glass was meant.\r\nThe saint told him it would be found over the hole in the ship's\r\nside, which proved to be correct.\r\n\r\nSt. Anthony of Padua had many adorers among fishermen.\r\nThe miracle he performed in sight of some heretics of Rimini,\r\nwhom he had vainly endeavoured to convert, is well known,\r\nand has, in many instances, formed the subject of artistic\r\nrepresentations which are found in continental churches. A\r\npainter, who had covered his canvas with fishes, in all attitudes",
  "p0440.png": "of prayerful listening, introduced some lobsters stretching out\r\nof the water, and coloured red; probably never having seen\r\nthem in their natural state. Being asked to explain this\r\nanachronism, he extricated himself from the dilemma by\r\nobserving that the whole affair was a miracle, and he had made\r\nthe miracle still greater.\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Anthony, at Padua (a splendid pile, the\r\neight cupolas and two fine towers giving it a character of\r\nOriental magnificence), there are bas-reliefs of the actions of the\r\nsaint, including the miracle of the fishes.\r\n\r\nIn the book of \"The Translation and the Miracles of St.\r\nVaast,\" we read that some Flemish fishermen had wounded\r\nwith their lances an enormous whale. They had already surrounded\r\nthe apparently dead monster, with the intention of\r\ndragging it ashore; but the whale, although wounded, suddenly\r\nregained his strength, and became furious, attacking the boats,\r\nand exposing the sailors to great danger. One of them proposed\r\nto his companion that they should invoke St. Arnould,\r\nand promise, in return for the saint's aid, a portion of the fish\r\nif they were saved. The result was that the whale offered\r\nno further resistance, but allowed himself to be dragged\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1540, St. Francis Xavier, decorated with the\r\nlofty title of the Apostle of the Indies, sailed in a Chinese\r\nvessel from Malacca on his way to Japan. The voyage was\r\nlong and hazardous: during which he was much afflicted by\r\nthe sight of an idol placed in the poop, having candles and\r\nincense continually burning before it, which, on every emergency,\r\nwas consulted by the crew with offerings of meat and birds.\r\nViewing the image as an impersonation of the devil, he thought\r\nit most grievous to be so many months under the sole direction\r\nof that unholy power. The same superstition still prevails at\r\nthe present time. In every large Chinese junk there is a shrine\r\nin honour of the goddess Tien-how, who is the tutelary deity of\r\nsailors. The idol of the goddess, which is carefully inclosed\r\nin a glass case, is daily worshipped by the crew. Above the",
  "p0450.png": "altar there is generally inscribed an ejaculatory prayer, such as:\r\n\"Wherever this ship may sail, O goddess, grant her a prosperous\r\nvoyage.\" On each side of the altar are inscribed sentences to\r\nthe following effect: \"Enable us by trading to acquire wealth;\"\r\nor, \"When on the wide waste of waters, fail not, O goddess,\r\nto show us thy favour.\" At the commencement and termination\r\nof each voyage, the goddess Tien-how receives a special\r\nhomage. When a junk is ready for sea, a number of Taonist\r\npriests are invited to go on board for the purpose of chanting\r\nprayers and offering sacrifices to Tien-how. But should a\r\nviolent storm arise after all these religious observances and\r\nthreaten the safety of the vessel, there is an all-prevailing opinion\r\namong Chinese sailors that it is owing to the anger of the gods\r\nagainst some sinful person or persons on board. A similar\r\nnotion prevailed among mariners in ancient times. We read\r\nthat when a storm overtook the vessel in which the prophet\r\nJonah was seeking to escape to Tarshish, in order that he might\r\nevade the divine command to preach repentance to the inhabitants\r\nof Nineveh, the terrified sailors cast lots to know for whose\r\ncause the evil was upon them; and when the lot fell upon the\r\ndisobedient prophet, they reluctantly cast him into the sea.\r\nThe Argonauts of Orpheus were disposed to act in a similar\r\nway towards Medea, when they attibuted[**attributed] to her presence the\r\nstorm by which the Argo was overtaken:\r\n\r\n\"And much they doubted in their prudent minds,\r\nWhether to kill and cast a prey to fishes,\r\nWretched Medea, and avert their fate.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told that when the vessel which carried Diagoras, surnamed\r\nthe Atheist--who flourished in the fifth century before\r\nthe Christian era--was beset by tempests, the sailors at once concluded\r\nthat it was owing to the atheistical principles which the\r\nphilosopher professed. Instances are known in which Chinese\r\nsailors during very severe storms have cast into the sea persons\r\nwhose wickedness they believed to have been the cause of the\r\ntempests, hoping by the sacrifice to appease the anger of the\r\ngods.",
  "p0460.png": "\r\nIn the middle ages, if a priest happened to be on board during\r\na time of tempest and danger, he ran the risk of being thrown\r\ninto the sea, his black dress being considered the cause of the\r\nstorm.[*]\r\n\r\nAs a Chinese junk is leaving port, other crews which hail\r\nfrom the same port mount the poops of their junks with the\r\nview of propitiating the winds and waves in favour of the\r\ndeparting vessel, some of them energetically beating gongs and\r\ntomtoms, while others, to dispel all evil influences, increase the\r\ndin by discharging popguns and fire-crackers.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel reaches the port, religious ceremonies are\r\nagain observed in honour of Tien-how. The services on such\r\noccasions are not held on board the junks, but in a temple in\r\nhonour of the goddess. They consist of thanksgivings, prayers,\r\nand offerings of boiled fowl and pork, or of small portions of\r\nthe merchandise which the junk has brought to port. Dr.\r\nGray, Archdeacon of Hong Kong, observes: \"In 1864 I\r\nentered a temple dedicated to Tien-how on Fisher's Island,\r\none of the Pescador\u00e9 group, and observed on the altar a number\r\nof small red bags of the size of an ordinary purse. On\r\neach bag was written the name of the person by whom, and\r\nthe purpose for which it had been placed on the altar. These\r\nbags I was told contained salt, large quantities of which are\r\nbrought by junks to the Pescador\u00e9 group for preserving fish.\r\nIn the same temple there was a large model of a Chinese junk,\r\nwhich I was informed it was the custom of the islanders to\r\ncarry in procession through the streets of their villages when\r\ncelebrating the natal anniversary of Tien-how.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gray, alluding to the excessive superstitions of the\r\nChinese sailors, observes: \"On one occasion our boat ran\r\naground in the river, and as the waters of the Yang-tsze were\r\n\r\n* The custom of throwing a guilty person overboard in a storm being\r\none of the most ancient superstitions, we can have but little difficulty in\r\nimagining a similar legend to have been current in different countries, and\r\nas those with whom Jonah took his voyage were Ph\u0153nicians, their maritime\r\nconnection with most parts of the then known world would still favour its\r\nextension.",
  "p0470.png": "rapidly receding, the men became much alarmed, and used\r\ntheir best endeavours to get her off. While the majority were\r\nthus exerting themselves, others were busily engaged in propitiating\r\nthe evil spirits who were supposed to have caused the\r\nmishap. After great efforts they got the vessel off, but as it was\r\nnow dark they let go the anchor, and waited for the following\r\nday. We had not been at anchor many minutes, when we\r\nobserved that the sailors who crowded round us were ill at ease.\r\nThey seemed to anticipate further disasters; and when we were\r\nretiring to rest, the servant of my companion in travel entered\r\nthe saloon in a state of great anxiety, informing us that many\r\nevil spirits were flitting about, and that the sailors were desirous\r\nthat we should discharge a revolver or fowling-piece to drive\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion they were thrown into a state of\r\nprofound alarm, because, when some ravens hovered over the\r\nvessel, my companion wished to shoot one or two of the birds.\r\nOnly the solemn assurance of my companion that he would not\r\nmolest the birds allayed the excitement.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailors on board ships in the river traffic are devotees of\r\nthe deity called \"Loong-moo,\" or the Dragon's Mother. In\r\nhonour of this goddess there are small shrines at frequent intervals\r\non the banks, and a religious ceremony of a very singular\r\nnature is usually observed by the masters of river junks\r\nat the beginning of a voyage. Previous to weighing anchor\r\nthe master takes his place in the bows, which the Chinese\r\nregard as the most sacred part of the ship, and proceeds to propitiate\r\nthe Dragon's Mother. On a small temporary altar erected\r\nfor the occasion, are three cups containing Chinese wine. Taking\r\nin his hands a live fowl, which he continues to hold until he kills\r\nit as a sacrifice, the master proceeds in the first place to perform\r\nthe Kowtow. He then takes the cups from the table one at a\r\ntime, and raising each above his head, pours its contents on the\r\ndeck as a libation. He next cuts the throat of the fowl with a\r\nsharp knife, taking care to sprinkle that portion of the deck on\r\nwhich he stands with the blood of the sacrifice. At this stage",
  "p0480.png": "of the ceremony several pieces of silver paper are presented to\r\nhim by one of the crew. These are sprinkled with the blood,\r\nand then fastened to the doorposts and lintels of the cabin,\r\nreminding one of the rites connected with the Passover among\r\nthe Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Burmese fishermen make a small shed, termed a \"Nat-*sin,\"\r\nnear their fishery, in which every morning offerings of\r\nfruit, leaves, rice, or some such tribute is placed; if this were\r\nnot done, they say that the Nat, or spirit, would destroy the\r\nfish. In a boat-race a preliminary row over the course is always\r\ntaken, a man at the prow holding in his extended arms a tray\r\nor basin containing a cocoa-nut, bunch of plantains, betel leaves,\r\netc., as an oblation to the Nats of the stream, to ensure their\r\ncausing no accident to the boat in the race.\r\n\r\nThe Indian sailor to propitiate the favour of his god, Muthiam,\r\nking of evil spirits, would drink the blood of a cock, or swallow\r\na live coal to avert evil influences.\r\n\r\nAmong the natives of the South Pacific, the extremity of a\r\ngreat cocoa-nut leaf, and comprising ten or twelve lesser leaves,\r\nwhen cut off and neatly bound with a piece of yellow cinet by\r\n\"the priest of all good,\" constituted the fisherman's god.\r\nWithout this Mokoiro, as the divinity was called, no canoe\r\nwould venture over the reef to fish.\r\n\r\nThe Gotland sailor always makes the sign of a cross before\r\nhe launches his boat into the sea.\r\n\r\nAMONG the curiosities of fish legends may be noticed one\r\nrelating to St. Neot, who established a monastery in\r\nCornwall, about four miles west of St. Cleer. Near this spot\r\nwas a spring, which in the driest season never failed. The\r\nsaint perceived in it three fishes, but did not presume to take\r\nthem until it was revealed to him for what purpose they were\r\nplaced there. An angel appeared to acquaint him that every\r\nday, or as often as he should find occasion, he might take one\r\nfish for his use, leaving the other two untouched. This condition\r\nbeing observed, he was assured that on his next return to",
  "p0490.png": "the well, he would always find three fishes as at the first. It\r\nhappened soon after this, that the saint was afflicted with a\r\ngrievous disorder, and unable for some days to take any sustenance.\r\nBarius, his faithful and affectionate servant, being\r\nalarmed at his long abstinence, went to the well and caught two\r\nfish, which he cooked in different ways, boiling one and broiling\r\nthe other, and brought them to his master on a dish. The\r\nsaint immediately took alarm, and inquired whence the two fish\r\nhad been brought. Barius, with honest simplicity, told him\r\nthat he had taken them from the well, and had dressed them in\r\ndifferent ways, hoping that if the one did not suit his sickly\r\npalate, the other might. Then said the saint, \"Why hast thou\r\ndone this?\" and commanded his trembling servant to take the\r\nfishes again to the well, and throwing himself prostrate, he continued\r\nin prayer, until Barius returning, acquainted him that the\r\ntwo fishes, after being dressed, were now in the well alive and\r\nactive, disporting in the water as usual. The saint then desired\r\nhim to go again, and catch one fish only and dress it for his use,\r\nof which he had no sooner tasted than he recovered his health\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA remarkable incident is mentioned in the life of St. Leven,\r\nof Cornwall. One evening he was on the rocks fishing. There\r\nwas a heavy pull on his line, and drawing it in, he found two\r\nfishes on the same hook. The saint, anxious to serve both\r\nalike, to avoid even the appearance of partiality, took both the\r\nfishes off the hook, and cast them back into the sea. Again\r\nthey came to the hook, and were returned to the sea. For the\r\nthird time the two fishes hooked themselves again. St. Leven,\r\nupon this, thought there must be some reason for this strange\r\noccurrence, so he took both fishes home with him. On his\r\narrival he found his sister, St. Breage, had come to visit him\r\nwith two children. Then he thought he saw the hand of Providence\r\nat work in guiding the fish to his hook. But the result\r\nwas unfortunate; the fish were cooked, and the children being\r\nhungry, were choked by eating the bones.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous miracles attributed to Thomas \u00e0",
  "p0500.png": "Becket is the following: When passing through St. Omers\r\nand Gravelines with some companions, as they were crossing a\r\nriver, one of them asked him as a favour to the hospitable\r\nmonks, who were about to receive them in their monastery,\r\n\"ut in adventu tuo comedunt pinguia.\" Becket replied that,\r\nbeing Wednesday, this might not be. \"Forsan non abundant\r\npiscibus,\" said his companion. \"Domini est providere,\" replied\r\nBecket; and at the word a great bream leaped out of the\r\nriver into his lap.\r\n\r\nDr. Walsh, in his \"Travels of Macarius,\" relates the following\r\nmiracle: \"At the distance of a quarter of a mile from the\r\nwalls is Balukli, or the Church of Fishes. The church is so\r\ncalled from a legend that has rendered it very celebrated\r\namong the Greeks. There stood on this place a small monastery\r\nof Greek Calayers, when Mahomet laid siege to Constantinople,\r\nwho, it seems, were not molested by his army. On the\r\nday of the decisive attack, a monk was frying some fish, when\r\nnews was suddenly brought to the convent that the Turks had\r\nentered the town, through the breach in the walls. 'I would\r\nas soon believe,' said he, 'that these fried fish would spring\r\nfrom the pan, and become again alive.' To reprove the incredulous\r\nmonk, the fish did spring from the pan into a vessel of\r\nwater which stood near, and swam about as if they had never\r\nbeen taken out of it. In commemoration of this miracle, a\r\nchurch was erected over the spot, containing a reservoir of\r\nwater, into which the fish, which still continued alive, were\r\nplaced. The 29th of April was appointed in the Greek\r\ncalendar as a festival to commemorate the circumstance; and\r\na vast concourse of people used to assemble here on every\r\nanniversary day to see the miraculous and everlasting fishes\r\nswim about the reservoir.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, a saint of Brittany, that his\r\nsister lived in a convent of nuns near his own monastery. It\r\nwas situated on the sea-shore, and exposed to the tempestuous\r\nwinds of the north. She represented the case of the convent to\r\nher brother, when he ordered the sea to retire four thousand",
  "p0510.png": "paces from the convent, which it did immediately. He then\r\ndirected his sister and her companions to range a row of flints\r\nalong the shore for a considerable distance, which was no\r\nsooner done than they increased to large rocks, which so entirely\r\nbroke the force of the winds that the convent was never after\r\nincommoded.\r\n\r\nIt is stated of St. Corentin, of Brittany, that every morning a\r\nlittle fish was seen in a fountain near his hermitage. The saint\r\ncaught it, cut off a sufficient quantity for his repast, then threw\r\nthe rest into the water, when the fish became whole again, and\r\non the next morning was ready for another quartering. A\r\nsimilar story is told by an Eastern traveller, Abou-el-Cassim,\r\nwho, alluding to a river which flows from Mount Caucasus into\r\nthe Black Sea, says: \"Every year there arrives in this part of\r\nthe river a great quantity of fish. The people cut off the flesh\r\non one side of them, eat it, and let the fish go. The year\r\nfollowing, the same creatures return and offer the other side,\r\nwhich they had preserved untouched. It is then discovered\r\nthat new flesh has replaced the old.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of fish legends, we find how St. Patrick,\r\nonce overcome by hunger, helped himself to pork chops on a\r\nfast-day. An angel met him with the forbidden cutlets in his\r\nhand; but the saint popped them into a pail of water, pattered\r\nan Ave Mary over them, and the chops were turned into a\r\ncouple of respectable and orthodox-looking trout. The angel\r\nlooked perplexed and went away, with his index-finger on the\r\nside of his nose. And see what became of it! In Ireland,\r\nmeat dipped into water and christened by the name of \"St\r\nPatrick's fish,\" is commonly eaten there even on fast-days, and\r\nto the great regret of all those who eat greedily enough to\r\nacquire an indigestion.\r\n\r\nThese stories remind us of the miracle performed by two\r\nChristian pilgrims in Poland, who, when travelling, arrived at\r\nthe house of a peasant, who was entertaining some friends on a\r\nfat hog that had been killed for the occasion. The pilgrims\r\nwere so hospitably entertained, that they pronounced a blessing",
  "p0520.png": "on the half-consumed hog, which from thenceforth never\r\ndiminished in weight. This \"cut and come again\" was frequently\r\nresorted to by the gratified peasant and his family.\r\n\r\nA different reception was encountered by St. Augustine, in\r\none of his visits to an English town. The inhabitants showered\r\nupon him every kind of insult, especially the fishermen, who\r\nlaid hands on the archbishop and his company, and ill-treated\r\nthem. The saint, to punish them, caused the tails of fish to\r\ngrow behind them.\r\n\r\nThe John Dory enjoyed an enviable notoriety among fishes,\r\ngreatly owing, no doubt, to its culinary merits. It seems to\r\nhave been held in particular veneration by the Greeks, who, in\r\nancient days, gave it the name of their supreme god, Zeus or\r\nJupiter. The modern name is said to be derived from the\r\nFrench word ador\u00e9e, worshipped. The modern Greeks also\r\ntreat the fish with due respect, by hanging it up in their most\r\nsacred places of worship. According to some writers, it was the\r\ndory and not the haddock that furnished St. Peter with the\r\ntribute money, which has so far obtained credit that many contend\r\nthe name is derived from il janitore, or the \"door-keeper,\"\r\nin allusion to St. Peter's office of keeping the keys of heaven.\r\nIn the \"Dialogues of Metellus\" (1693), we read:\r\n\r\n\"O superstitious dainty, Peter's fish;\r\nHow cam'st thou here to make so goodly dish?\"\r\n\r\nThe dark spot on the dory was said to be the impression\r\nleft by the finger and thumb of St. Peter. Others assert that\r\nthis mark was occasioned by the fingers of St. Christopher,\r\nwho captured one of these fishes as he was in the act of carrying\r\nhis Master across a ford. John is said to be a corruption\r\nof the French word jaune (yellow), from the golden tint that\r\nprevails over this fish when taken out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of Filey, in Yorkshire, account for the black\r\nmarks on the haddock by the following legend: \"The Evil\r\nSpirit, in one of his mischievous pranks, determined to build\r\nFiley Bridge for the destruction of ships and sailors, and the",
  "p0530.png": "annoyance of fishermen. In the progress of his work, he accidentally\r\nlet fall his hammer into the sea, and, being in haste to\r\nsnatch it back, caught a haddock instead, and thereby made\r\nthe imprint retained by this fish to the present day.\"\r\n\r\nBuchanan, in his \"History of Scotland,\" relating the\r\naccession of Ethus, the seventy-second king of Scotland (874),\r\nsays: \"Among the prodigies of his time, they reckon those\r\nsea-fishes then appearing, which are seldom seen, and after\r\nlong intervals of time; but they never appear but in shoals,\r\nnor without some unlucky presage. The common people call\r\nthem Monachi-marini; i.e., sea-monks.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Normandy,\" says Hoare, in his \"Giraldus,\" \"a few\r\ndays before the death of Henry II., the fish of a certain pool\r\nnear Seez, five miles from the Castle of Exme, fought during\r\nthe night so furiously with each other, both in the water and\r\nout of it, that the neighbouring people were attracted by the\r\nnoise of it to the spot; and so desperate was the conflict that\r\nscarcely a fish was found alive in the morning: thus by a\r\nwonderful and unheard-of prognostic foretelling the death of\r\none by that of many.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the life and penance of St. Gregory, he sold all his\r\ngoods for the benefit of the poor, retaining nothing for himself\r\nbut a silver basin, given to him by his mother St. Silvia. One\r\nday a poor shipwrecked sailor came several times to the cell\r\nwhere he was writing; and as he had no money, he gave him\r\nthe basin. A long time after, St. Gregory saw the same ship-*wrecked\r\nsailor reappear, in the form of his guardian-angel, who\r\ntold him that henceforward God had destined him to rule his\r\nChurch and become the successor of the papal ruler.\r\n\r\nThe Jews have a queer Talmudistical tradition that the sea\r\nthrew out a great fish; sixty cities ate of it, and sixty cities\r\nsalted some of its flesh for food. From one of its eyes\r\nwere made three hundred measures of oil.\r\n\r\nFishes used to be considered unlawful food in the East, as\r\nthe name of Allah could not frequently be pronounced over\r\nthem before they died. To obviate this, Mahomet, it is said,",
  "p0540.png": "blessed a knife and cast it into the sea, whereby all the fish\r\nwere hallowed, and had their throats cut before they came\r\non shore. The large openings behind the gills, according to\r\nMussulman fable, are the wounds thus miraculously made\r\nwithout killing the fish.\r\n\r\nAccording to an Irish legend, Fionn, being on the banks\r\nof the River Boyne, met with some fishermen who had been\r\nsent by his enemies to take \"the Salmon of Foreknowledge.\"\r\nThe fishermen took a salmon of great size and beauty, which\r\nthey placed on the fire to broil, leaving it in charge of Fionn,\r\nwho was to take care it did not burn, on pain of losing his\r\nhead. During the process of cooking, a spark flew from the\r\nfire, which raised a blister on the fish, Fionn applied his thumb\r\nto the scorched part, in order to force down the blister; but\r\nthe heat burning his thumb, he thrust it into his mouth to\r\nrelieve the pain. No sooner had he done so, than he began\r\nto be gifted with foreknowledge and prophecy; for this was the\r\nSalmon of Foreknowledge which he had been cooking; and he\r\nat once acquired the knowledge that the King of Tara, seven\r\nyears before, had expressly sent these fishermen in quest of the\r\nSalmon of Foreknowledge, in order that he might ascertain\r\nwhere he, Fionn, had taken refuge, so that he might seize and\r\nslay him.[*]\r\n\r\nIT appears that the saints had their dishonest clients, who,\r\nwhen the perils of the ocean were over, forgot the vows\r\nand promises they had made for deliverance. Erasmus, in his\r\n\"Colloquy of the Shipwreck,\" describing a company threatened\r\nwith that calamity, says: \"Did no one think of St. Christopher?\r\nI heard one, and could not help smiling, who, with a shout\r\n\r\n* In a Welsh tale, Gwion (who was afterwards Taliesin), was left in\r\ncharge of the Cauldron of Ceridwyn. Three drops of the charmed liquor\r\nflew out of the cauldron, and fell upon the finger of Gwion; \"and by\r\nreason of their great heat he put his finger to his mouth, and the instant he\r\nput those marvel-working drops into his mouth, he foresaw everything that\r\nwas to come, and perceived that his chief care was to guard against the\r\nwiles of Ceridwyn; and in very great fear he fled towards his own land.\"",
  "p0550.png": "lest he should not be heard, promised to Christopher, who\r\ndwells in the great church of Paris, and is a mountain rather\r\nthan a statue, a wax image as great as himself. He had\r\nrepeated this more than once, bellowing as loud as he could,\r\nwhen the man who happened to be next to him, touched him\r\nwith his finger, and hinted, 'You could not pay that even if\r\nyou set all your goods to auction.' Then the other, in a voice\r\nlow enough that St. Christopher might not hear him, whispered,\r\n'Be still, you fool!--do you fancy I am speaking in\r\nearnest? If I once touch the shore, I shall not give him a\r\ntallow-candle!'\"\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese seaman would, in times of peril, attach an\r\nimage of St. Anthony to the mast of his ship, and pray to it\r\nfor the wind to change, or a storm to cease. If prayers were\r\nunsuccessful, imprecations followed, and the image was beaten\r\nwith sticks to improve its behaviour.\r\n\r\nOn some occasions the saints would dispense with miracles.\r\nThus St. Molua saw a monster, the size of a large boat, in pursuit\r\nof two boys swimming, unconscious of danger. Instead of\r\nalarming them with an announcement of their perilous situation,\r\nhe called out to them to try a race, and see who would reach\r\nthe shore first. The monster was thus baulked of his prey, and\r\nwas not seen afterwards.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous legends ascribed to St. Patrick, is one\r\nrelating to a leper, whom some mariners would not carry to\r\ntheir ship; on which the saint took a stone altar consecrated by\r\nthe pope, cast it into the sea, caused the leper to sit upon it,\r\nand the stone, keeping company with the ship all the voyage,\r\ngot into port with her at the same time.\r\n\r\nSome fishermen, in the county of Leinster, drawing their\r\nnets from a river, loaded with fish, St. Patrick asked them for\r\nsome. They refused him, and he cursed them and the river,\r\nand from that day no fish were to be had.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's nephew, St. Lumanus, being desirous of taking\r\na journey by sea, when wind and tide were against him, he\r\nhoisted the sails, trusted in the merits of St. Patrick, and the\r\nship, without any pilot, sailed against wind and stream.",
  "p0560.png": "\r\nIt is related of St. Moel that, when he wanted fish, he caught\r\nthem on dry ground; but this was no greater feat than that of\r\nSt. Fechan, who, after a long fast, would change some acorns\r\ninto pork and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nWalking on the sea was an ordinary circumstance among\r\nsome saints. One day as Scothinus was travelling in this\r\nmanner across the Irish Channel, he met his brother, St.\r\nBarras, passing in a ship. The latter, who did not possess the\r\naquatic qualification, appears to have been jealous of the other,\r\nand sneeringly asked him what he was walking upon. Scothinus\r\njestingly replied that it was a beautiful meadow. On St.\r\nBarras denying this in a very unceremonious manner, Scothinus\r\nstooped down, and gathered a handful of fresh flowers. St.\r\nBarras, to refute him in his own way of arguing, also stooped\r\ndown, and, putting his hand in the sea, drew it out full of\r\nfishes!\r\n\r\nSt. Aidan preferred the equestrian mode of traversing the sea,\r\nand had his horses trained for that purpose, the water becoming\r\nhard under foot. In this manner the same saint drove a waggon\r\nand a team of horses over an Irish bog.\r\n\r\nThe legend of St. Clement and the anchor is thus explained.\r\nWhen the Roman Emperor Trajan understood that upwards\r\nof five hundred persons had been baptised by that saint--who\r\nafterwards destroyed the temple of idols--he caused him to be\r\nthrown into the sea, with an anchor bound round his neck.\r\nAt the intercession of his disciples, the sea departed three miles\r\nfrom the shore, and they found a temple of marble, with the\r\nbody of St. Clement in an ark and the anchor near him.\r\n\r\nTHE foundation of Westminster Abbey is ascribed to the\r\nfollowing legend. It was on a certain Sunday night,\r\nin the reign of King Sebert, the eve of the day fixed by\r\nMellitus, first Bishop of London, for the consecration of the\r\noriginal monastery in the Isle of Thorney, that a fisherman of\r\nthe name of Edric was casting his nets from the shore of the\r\nisland into the Thames. On the other side of the river, where",
  "p0570.png": "Lambeth now stands, a bright light attracted his notice. He\r\ncrossed, and found a venerable personage, in foreign attire,\r\ncalling for some one to ferry him over the dark stream. Edric\r\nconsented. The stranger landed, and proceeded at once to the\r\nchurch. On his way, he evoked with his staff the two springs\r\nof the island. The air suddenly became bright with celestial\r\nsplendour. The building stood out clear, without darkness or\r\nshadow; a host of angels descending and re-ascending, with\r\nsweet odours and flaming candles, assisted; and the church\r\nwas dedicated with the usual solemnities.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman remained in his boat, so awe-struck by the\r\nsight, that when the mysterious visitant returned and asked for\r\nfood, he was obliged to own that he had not caught a single\r\nfish. Then the stranger revealed his name. \"I am Peter,\r\nkeeper of the keys of heaven. When Mellitus arrives to-morrow,\r\ntell him what you have seen, and show him the token\r\nthat I, St. Peter, have consecrated my own church of St. Peter,\r\nWestminster, and have anticipated the Bishop of London.\r\nFor yourself, go out into the river; you will catch a plentiful\r\nsupply of fish, whereof the larger part shall be salmon. This I\r\nhave granted on two conditions--first, that you never fish\r\nagain on Sundays; secondly, that you pay a tithe of them to the\r\nAbbey of Westminster.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day at dawn, \"the Bishop Mellitus rose and began\r\nto prepare the anointing oil and the utensils for the great\r\ndedication, and, with the king, arrived at the appointed hour.\r\nAt the door they were met by Edric with the salmon in his\r\nhand, which he presented from St. Peter, in a gentle manner,\r\nto the bishop. He then proceeded to point out the marks of\r\nthe twelve crosses on the church, the walls within and without\r\nmoistened with holy water; the letters of the Greek\r\nalphabet written twice over distinctly on the sand of the now\r\nsacred island; the traces of the oil, and (chiefest of the miracles)\r\nthe droppings of the angelic candles. The bishop professed\r\nhimself entirely convinced, and returned from the church\r\nsatisfied that the dedication had been performed sufficiently",
  "p0580.png": "better, and in a more saintly fashion than he could have\r\ndone.\"[*]\r\n\r\nVotive offerings connected with the sea were of a varied\r\ncharacter. In the cathedral of Alghero, in Sardinia, a\r\nskull is shown stated to be that of one of the innocents slain by\r\nHerod! A document, written in 1645, states that it was presented\r\nby Cardinal Colonna in 1597, as a thanksgiving for his\r\npreservation from shipwreck.\r\n\r\nCanute evinced his gratitude to heaven for his safe return\r\nfrom Rome in a remarkable manner. He gave to the Christchurch\r\nof Canterbury the port of Sandwich, and all the dues\r\narising out of it on either side of the haven, \"so that when the\r\ntide is highest and fullest, and there be a ship floating as near\r\nthe land as possible, and there be a man standing on the ship,\r\nwith a taper axe in his hand, whithersoever the large taper axe\r\nmight be thrown out of the ship, throughout all that land the\r\nministers of Christchurch should enjoy their rights.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the saints, no doubt, preferred substantial gifts for\r\naverting the horrors of shipwreck, yet the poor mariners' vow\r\nof penitence was not unheard. In the midst of a violent\r\ntempest, the fishermen belonging to Dieppe declared that if\r\nspared at sea they would go barefooted to some celebrated\r\nplace of pilgrimage on reaching home. The vessel would,\r\nthereupon, be righted, the crew believing that supernatural\r\nagency assisted their labours. The mariners at this port had\r\nthe habit when at sea to have frequent prayers on board, but\r\n\r\n* In the early annals of Westminster Abbey, mention is made that\r\na law-suit was successfully carried on by the Convent of Westminster\r\nagainst the Rector of Rotherhithe in 1282, on the ground that St. Peter\r\nhad granted the first haul. The parish clergy, however, struggled against\r\nthe claim, and the monastic historian, Flete, in the gradually increasing\r\nscarcity of salmon, saw a divine judgment on the fishermen, for not having\r\ncomplied with St. Peter's request. Once a year, as late as 1382, one of the\r\nfishermen, as representative of Edric, took his place beside the prior, and\r\nbrought in a salmon for St. Peter. It was carried in state through the\r\nmiddle of the refectory. The prior and the whole fraternity rose as it\r\npassed to the high table, and then the fisherman received ale and bread\r\nfrom the cellarer, in return for the fish's tail.",
  "p0590.png": "they preceded this act of devotion by a particular ceremony,\r\nthe omission of which, they believed, would bring upon them\r\ndisastrous consequences. A boy belonging to the ship ran\r\nabout, urging all hands to come on deck. He then lighted a\r\ncandle, crying: \"The candle of the good God is lighted! The\r\nholy name of God be praised!\" Afterwards the eldest of the\r\nsailors, who was called the cur\u00e9, repeated with a loud voice\r\nsome prayers. When the herring-fishery was over, and the\r\nships entered the port of Dieppe, the crew would thunder out\r\na thanksgiving Te Deum.\r\n\r\nIN the early ages, besides streamers bearing a representation\r\nof the saint after whom a ship was named, his image\r\nseems to have been placed on board. When Edward III. embarked\r\nin the Thomas, in 1350, before the battle with the\r\nSpaniards, an image of that saint was sent to ensure divine\r\nprotection. It appears also that a figure of Our Lady, which\r\nhad been captured in a ship at sea, was carefully conveyed to\r\nthis monarch while at Eltham Palace in 1376.[*]\r\n\r\nSmall silver images of ships were sometimes used as votive-offerings\r\nfor preservation from danger at sea. In July 1397,\r\nthe master of the Trinity was paid for his expenses in carrying\r\nto Arques a small ship made of silver, which, on his first\r\nvoyage to Burgundy for wine for the king's use, he had vowed\r\nduring a storm to offer to the figure of the Virgin at Arques for\r\nthe preservation of his ship.[*]\r\n\r\n* Among the Saxons, in the hour of battle, the priest took the image of\r\ntheir venerated idol, Irminsula, from the marble column in its magnificent\r\ntemple, and carried it to the field. After the conflict, captives and the\r\ncowardly of their own army were immolated to the idol.\r\n\r\nAugustus having lost a number of his ships in a storm, expressed his resentment\r\nagainst Neptune, by ordering that his image should not be carried\r\nin procession with those of the other gods, at the next solemnity of the\r\nCircensian games.\r\n\r\n* Lord Lindsay, in his \"Christian Art\" (vol. i. p. 18), remarks: \"The\r\nallegory of a ship is peculiarly dwelt upon by the ancient fathers. A ship\r\nentering the port, was a favourite heathen emblem of the close of life. But\r\nthe Christian idea, and its elevation from individual to universal or\r\ncatholic humanity, is derived directly from the Bible. \"Without doubt,\"",
  "p0600.png": "\r\nJoinville, in his \"Memoirs,\" relates an incident that happened\r\nduring the voyage of St. Louis to France. Being in danger of\r\nshipwreck, the queen made a vow of a silver ship to St.\r\nNicholas, who thereupon delivered the travellers from their\r\nperil. On the arrival of the queen in France, she caused the\r\nship to be made, and had it ornamented with the figures of the\r\nking, herself, her three children; also the sailors. All were\r\nmade in solid silver, and the robes were of silver thread.\r\n\r\nIn the voyage of Vasco da Gama to India, in 1497 (being\r\nthe first that was undertaken by the Portuguese round Africa),\r\nat an interview with the Samorin, or ruler of Calicut, he was\r\nasked why he had brought no presents. \"But,\" added the\r\nSamorin, \"I hear that you have a Saint Mary in gold, and I\r\ndesire to have that.\" Da Gama, a little confounded at this\r\ndemand, replied, \"that the image he was told of was not of\r\ngold, but wood gilded; but nevertheless as it had preserved\r\nhim at sea, he desired to be excused from parting with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn his discovery of the New World, Columbus had fearful\r\nconflicts with the elements, and often incurred great risks. In\r\none particular instance, after his return to Europe, he was\r\nexposed to a tremendous storm. \"Seeing all human skill\r\nbaffled and confounded, he endeavoured to propitiate heaven\r\nby solemn vows and acts of penance. By his orders a number\r\nof beans, equal to the number of persons on board, were put\r\ninto a cup, and on one of them was cut the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\nsays St. Augustine, \"the ark is the figure of the city of God, pilgrimising\r\nin the world; or, in other words, of the Church, which is saved by the\r\nwood on which hung the mediator between God and man; the man Jesus\r\nChrist.\"\r\n\r\nThe same interpretation was recognised in the Latin Church, in the\r\ndays of Tertullian, and St. Cyprian, etc. The bark of St. Peter is similarly\r\nrepresented in a Greek gem found in the catacombs, as sailing on a\r\nfish, probably Leviathan, or Satan, while doves, emblematical of the faithful,\r\nperch on the mast and stern; two apostles row; a third lifts up his\r\nhands in prayer, and our Saviour approaching the vessel, supports Peter\r\nby the hand when about to sink. But the allegory of the ship is carried\r\nout to its fullest extent in the fifty-seventh chapter of the second book of\r\nthe Apostolical Constitutions, supposed to have been compiled in the\r\nnames of the apostles, in the fourth century.",
  "p0610.png": "Each of the crew made a vow that should he draw forth the\r\nmarked bean, he would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of\r\nSanta Maria di Guadalupe, bearing a wax taper of five pounds\r\nweight. The admiral was the first to put in his hand, and the\r\nlot fell upon him. From that moment he considered himself a\r\npilgrim bound to perform a vow. Another lot was cast in the\r\nsame way for a pilgrimage to the chapel of Our Lady of Loretto,\r\nwhich fell to a seaman named Pedro de Villa, and the admiral\r\nengaged to pay his expenses. A third lot was also cast for a\r\npilgrimage to Santa Clara di Magner, to perform a solemn mass,\r\nand to watch all night in the chapel; and this also fell on\r\nColumbus.\r\n\r\nThe tempest still raging, the admiral and sailors made a vow\r\nthat, if spared, wherever they first landed, they would go in\r\nprocession, barefooted and in their shirts, to offer up thanks\r\nand prayers in some chapel dedicated to the Virgin. The\r\nheavens, however, seemed deaf to the vows, but the filling of\r\nsome empty casks with sea-water, as ballast, relieved the ship\r\nof her rolling.\r\n\r\nIn another danger the whole crew made a vow, in case their\r\nlives were spared, to fast upon bread and water for a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOBLATIONS to the sea were common in ancient and\r\nolden times. During a tempest the Greek sailor would\r\nthrow into the sea small pieces of bread, invoking divine aid\r\nto calm the winds. The Russian sailor, to appease the evil\r\ngenius that troubled the waters of the White Sea, would cast\r\ninto the waves a cake made of flour and butter. The Baron\r\nVon Hebertstein, in his account of Russia in the earlier part of\r\nthe sixteenth century, relates an incident that occurred during\r\na voyage in the Baltic: \"Having passed the Holy Nose they\r\ncame to a certain rocky mountain, which they were obliged to\r\nsail around. Here they were detained several days by contrary\r\nwinds, upon which a sailor said, 'This rock which you see is\r\ncalled Semes, and unless we appease it with a gift, we shall not",
  "p0620.png": "easily pass it.' The captain reproved him for his vain superstition;\r\nthe sailor held his peace, and after having been detained\r\nthree or four days by the tempest, the wind abated, and they\r\nweighed anchor. When a favourable wind arose for carrying\r\nthem on, the sailor said: 'You laughed at my warning about\r\nappeasing the rock Semes, as though it were an idle superstition,\r\nbut if I had not secretly climbed the rock in the night\r\nand propitiated Semes you would not have had a passage\r\ngranted to you.' Upon being questioned as to the offering he\r\nhad made, he said that he had poured on the projecting rock\r\nwe had seen, some oatmeal mixed with butter.\"\r\n\r\nThese oblations to sea-deities were common in most countries.\r\nIn Th\u00e9v\u00e9not's \"Travels\" (1687), he alludes to Dabul, in the\r\nIndies: \"All the people of that coast are much given to seafaring,\r\nso the Gentiles offer many times sacrifices to the sea,\r\nespecially when any of their kindred and friends are abroad\r\nupon a voyage. Once I saw this manner of sacrificing; a\r\nwoman carried in her hands a vessel made of straw, about three\r\nfeet long. It was covered with a veil, three men, playing on a\r\npipe and drum, accompanied her, and two others had, each on\r\nthe head, a basketful of meat and fruits. Being arrived at the\r\nsea-side, they threw into the sea the vessel of straw, after they\r\nhad made some prayers, and left the meat they had brought\r\nwith them on the shore, that the poor and others might eat of\r\nit. I have seen the same sacrifice performed by Mahometans.\r\nThe Gentiles offer another sacrifice at the end of September,\r\nwhich they call 'opening the sea,' because no one can sail\r\nupon their seas from May until that time; but that sacrifice is\r\nperformed with no great ceremony--they only throw cocoa-nuts\r\ninto the sea.\"\r\n\r\nA Norwegian legend states that a mariner wished, according\r\nto custom, to give on Christmas-day a cake to the spirit of the\r\nwaters; but when he came to the shore, lo! the waters were\r\nfrozen over. Unwilling to leave his offering upon the ice, the\r\nfisherman tried to make a hole, but in spite of all his labour, it\r\nwas not nearly large enough for him to put the cake through.",
  "p0630.png": "Suddenly a little tiny hand as white as snow was stretched\r\nthrough the hole, and seizing the cake, doubled it up, and\r\nwithdrew with it. In this legend originates the compliment\r\npaid to a Norwegian lady, \"your hand is like a water-sprite's.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Sandinavians[** Scandinavians?], Thor, together with Freya, were\r\npropitiated by seamen with sacrifices, sometimes of human\r\nbeings previous to any predatory expedition.\r\n\r\nThe oblation custom is not extinct among the natives of\r\nIndia. In 1853, during a voyage from Rangoon to Calcutta,\r\nin the ship Lahore, the wind was very light and variable. There\r\nwere a number of camp and other followers on board, who\r\nbeing extremely anxious for the speedy termination of the\r\nvoyage, collected money among themselves, and had the same\r\ndeposited as a propitiation, in order to ensure a favourable and\r\nstronger breeze.\r\n\r\nA superstitious belief prevailed among the boatmen of the\r\nLake of Traunsee, in Austria, that it must have one victim\r\nannually, and a legend relates how this offering was made many\r\nyears ago. There was a nunnery at Traunkirche, and among\r\nits inmates there was one, very beautiful of course, who so far\r\nforgot her vow as to fall in love with a young miller, who lived\r\nat the Corbach mill, on the other side of the lake. Inspired in\r\nthe same manner as Leander, the youth was in the habit of\r\nswimming across the lake at night to visit his mistress, and this\r\nhe continued to do until the fatal time arrived, with the\r\nexpiring year, when the lake must have its victim. Some disclosure\r\nof the miller's visits was made, and the nun was made\r\nthe expiatory sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA similar superstition of an annual offering to appease the\r\nspirit of the waters was current on the Danube. \"I, myself,\"\r\nobserves Auguste Ellrich, in his \"Sketches of Austria,\" \"saw a\r\nfellow fall overboard, and drown, after a long struggle, during\r\nwhich neither the crew of the vessel nor his comrades made\r\nthe slightest effort to save him. While he was battling among\r\nthe impetuous waves, the crew stood quite composedly on deck,",
  "p0640.png": "and cried out in chorus, 'Jack! Jack! give in--dost thou not\r\nsee that it pleases God?'\"\r\n\r\nWith their usual amount of credulity, fishermen must have\r\nhad a keen sense of hearing, if we may trust the author of a\r\nmanuscript in the Cottonian collections, who observes that, \"At\r\nSaltburne Mouth (Yorkshire), a small brooke dischargeth itselfe\r\ninto the sea, which lyeinge lower under the bankes, serveth as\r\na trunke, or conduite, to convey the rumour of the sea into the\r\nneighbour fields; for when all wyndes are whiste, and the sea\r\nrestes unmoved as a standying poole, sometimes there is such a\r\nhorrible groninge heard from that creak[** creek?], at the least six myles\r\nin the mayne land, that the fishermen dare not put forth,\r\nthough thyrst of gaine drive them on, houlding an opinion that\r\nthe sea is a greedie beaste, raging for hunger, and desyrs to be\r\nsatisfied with men's carcasses.\"\r\n\r\nA singular custom, blending the Scandinavian worship of\r\nN\u00f6kke, or Nekkar, with the Celtic rites of Druidism, formerly\r\nprevailed in the Isle of Lewes. Martin says: \"The inhabitants\r\nof this island had an ancient custom to sacrifice to a sea-god,\r\ncalled Shony, at Hallow-tide, in the following manner. The\r\ninhabitants round the island come to the church of St. Mulvay,\r\nhaving each man his provision along with him; every family\r\nfurnished a peck of malt, and this was brewed into ale. One\r\nof their number was picked out to wade into the sea, and,\r\ncarrying a cup of ale in his hand, standing still in that posture,\r\ncried out with a loud voice: 'I give you this cup of ale, hoping\r\nyou will be so kind as to send us plenty of sea-water for\r\nenriching our ground the ensuing year,' and so threw the cup\r\nof ale into the sea. This was performed in the night-time. At\r\nhis return to land, they all went to the church, where there was\r\na candle burning before the altar; and then, standing silent for\r\na little while, one of them gave a signal, at which the candle\r\nwas put out, and immediately all of them went to the fields,\r\nwhere they remained, drinking, dancing, and singing the\r\nremainder of the night.\"",
  "p0650.png": "\r\nThe present custom of christening ships may be considered\r\nas a relic of the ancient libation practised when they\r\nwere launched. On the completion of a ship, it was decked\r\nwith garlands and flowers, and the mariners adorned with\r\ncrowns. It was launched into the sea, with loud acclamations,\r\nand other expressions of joy, and being purified by a priest with\r\na lighted torch, an egg, and brimstone, or in some other manner,\r\nit was consecrated to the god whose image it carried.[*] In\r\nmodern Greece when a ship is launched, the bow is decorated\r\nwith flowers, and the captain takes a jar of wine, which he\r\nraises to his lips, and then pours upon the deck.\r\n\r\nThe Greek captain who purchases a vessel which he is to\r\ncommand himself, takes possession of it by a ceremony which\r\nis called espousing the ship; on this occasion he suspends in it\r\na laurel crown as a symbol of the marriage, and a bag of garlic\r\nas a preservative against tempest.\r\n\r\nThe custom of blessing ships is alluded to by the monks of\r\nSt Denys. In July, 1418, the Bishop of Bangor was sent to\r\nSouthampton to bless the king's ship, the Gr\u00e2ce Dieu, and\r\nreceived five pounds for his expenses. In the fleet commanded\r\nby John de Outremarius against the Tunisians, according to\r\nancient custom, and to ensure success, the ships were blessed\r\nby the priests, and being afterwards exposed to storms, the captains\r\ndesired the soldiers and sailors to invoke the Lord, and\r\nwhile they were at prayers the wind suddenly became favourable.\r\n\r\n* Before the ancients embarked on a voyage, they offered prayers and\r\nsacrifices to the gods, especially to Neptune, and all the people who\r\nassembled on such occasions joined them in prayers for deliverance from\r\nthe dangers they were about to encounter. After this, they usually let fly\r\na dove, which was considered an omen of their safe return, because that bird\r\nwhen forced from its habitation, delights to return. On landing at the\r\nplace of destination, the sailors discharged the vows they had made to the\r\ngods, and they usually offered a sacrifice to Jupiter for enabling them to\r\nleave their ships and regain the land. Their devotions were sometimes\r\npaid to Nereus, Glaucus, Ino, Melicertes, the Cabiri, and other gods of\r\nthe sea, more especially Neptune. Those who had escaped any danger at\r\nsea offered presents to the gods, and sometimes added the garment in\r\nwhich they had escaped, and a tablet containing an account of their deliverance.\r\nIf nothing else remained, they at least cut off their hair,\r\nwhich they consecrated to their protectors.",
  "p0660.png": "In 1242, when Henry III. was at war with France, a fleet was\r\nprepared in which that monarch embarked, after visiting the\r\nshrines of many saints to propitiate their influence against\r\nstorms, and to ensure success to his arms.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, conformably with Russian usages, the\r\nvessels which are used for carrying produce to and from Siberia,\r\nnever leave port without every part being blessed by the priests.\r\n\r\nBefore the Reformation it was usual for the priests at Yarmouth\r\nto give a blessing to the fishing vessels yearly, and it was\r\nafterwards customary for the minister of the parish to preach a\r\nfishing sermon.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Twelfth Day (January 18) is devoted to that\r\nsingular custom of blessing the waters of the Neva.\r\n\r\nOn the same day at Constantinople, the Greek patriarch performs\r\na similar ceremony. He throws a cross into the sea, and\r\nit is asserted that skilful divers succeed in getting it before\r\nreaching the bottom.\r\n\r\nIT was a belief among the ancients that certain persons had\r\nthe power of raising tempests. Pomponius Mela, who\r\nwrote in the reign of the Emperor Claudian, mentions a set of\r\npriestesses, in the Island of Sena (Ile des Saints), on the coast\r\nof Gaul, who were said to control the winds and the waves by\r\ntheir enchantments. Eolus is stated in the \"Odyssey\" to have\r\npossessed these powers. Calypso in the same work is said to\r\nhave been able to control the winds.\r\n\r\nA strong belief in human agency to influence the ocean, prevailed\r\nin the fifteenth century. Witches were supposed to\r\npossess this attribute.[*] A curious confession was made in Scotland\r\nabout the year 1591, by one Agnes Sampson, a reputed\r\nwitch, who seemed to have a ready imagination, quickened\r\n\r\n* From the \"P\u0153nitentiale\" of Theodore, we learn that the Anglo-Saxons\r\nhad a belief in the power of witchcraft to let loose tempests.\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus tells us that \"Ericus, King of Sweden, in his time, was\r\nheld second to none in the magical art; and he was so familiar with the\r\nevil spirits, which he exceedingly adored, that which way soever he turned\r\nhis cap, the wind would presently blow that way. From this occasion he\r\nwas called 'Windy Cap.'\"",
  "p0670.png": "most probably by the application of torture. She vowed that\r\n\"At the time his majesty (James VI.) was in Denmark, she\r\ntook a cat and christened it, and afterwards bound to each part\r\nof that cat the chiefest parts of a dead man, and several joints\r\nof his body; and that in the night following, the said cat was\r\nconveyed into the midst of the sea, by herself and other witches,\r\nsailing in their riddles, or crieves, and so left the said cat right\r\nbefore the town of Leith, in Scotland. This done, there arose\r\nsuch a tempest in the sea, as a greater hath not been seen,\r\nwhich tempest was the cause of the perishing of a boat or\r\nvessel coming over from the town of Brunt Island to the town\r\nof Leith, wherein were sundry jewels and rich gifts, which\r\nshould have been presented to the new Queen of Scotland, at\r\nher majesty's coming to Leith. Again, it is confessed that the\r\nsaid christened cat was the cause of the king's majesty's ship,\r\nat his coming forth of Denmark, having a contrary wind to the\r\nrest of the ships then being in his company, which thing was\r\nmost strange and true, as the king's majesty acknowledgeth.\"\r\n\r\nSupposing that the miserable old beldame really did perform\r\nher satanic operations, such an outrage on the majesty of the\r\nsea was quite enough to excite its indignation, though not in\r\nthe partial manner described.\r\n\r\nAgnes Sampson mentioned another frolic that she and her\r\nsister witches had enjoyed during a sea-journey performed in\r\nsieves. The Evil One, who condescended to amuse them, rolled\r\nupon the waves beside them, resembling a huge haystack in\r\nsize and appearance. These agreeable old women went on\r\nboard of a foreign ship richly laden with wines; where, invisible\r\nto the crew, they feasted until the sport became tiresome,\r\nand then Satan sunk the vessel, and all on board--the weird\r\nsisters of course excepted.\r\n\r\nKing James in his \"D\u00e6monology,\" says that \"Witches can\r\nraise stormes and tempestes in the aire, either on sea or land.\"\r\n\r\nScot, in his \"Discoverie of Witchcraft,\" observes: \"No one\r\nendued with common sense but will deny that the elements\r\nare obedient to witches, and at their commandment, or that",
  "p0680.png": "they may at their pleasure send hail, rain, tempest, thunder and\r\nlightning, when she being but an old doting woman casteth a\r\nflint stone over her left shoulder toward the west, or hurleth a\r\nlittle sea-sand up into the element, or wetteth a broom-sprig in\r\nwater and sprinkleth the same into the air, or diggeth a pit in\r\nthe earth, and putting water therein, stirreth it about with her\r\nfinger; or boileth hog's bristles, or layeth sticks across upon a\r\nbank where never a drop of water is, or buryeth sage until it be\r\nrotten; all which things are confessed by witches, and affirmed\r\nby writers to be the means that witches use to raise extraordinary\r\ntempests and rain.\"\r\n\r\nReginald Scot has the advantage of his royal master, \"the\r\nBritish Solomon,\" on this subject, and his book (published in\r\n1584) was designed to demonstrate the absurdity of the\r\nprevalent belief in witchcraft. This excited the fury of King\r\nJames, who wrote his \"D\u00e6monology\" against \"the damnable\r\nopinions of Scot, who is not ashamed in public print to deny\r\nthere can be such a thing as witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nA hazy kind of belief in the power of witches to control the\r\nwinds and sea existed in the eighteenth century. A tale was\r\nimposed upon the public by John Dunton, \"a man of scribbling\r\ncelebrity\" (as he is described by Sir Walter Scott), which was\r\ncalled the \"Apparition Evidence.\" In this story many incredible\r\nmatters are related of an old lady named Leckie, who\r\nresided at Minehead in Somersetshire, with one son and a\r\ndaughter. Mrs. Leckie, who made herself so agreeable that\r\nher friends used to say to her, and to each other, it was a\r\nthousand pities such an excellent gentlewoman must from her\r\nage be soon lost to her friends. To this Mrs. Leckie would\r\nreply: \"Although you appear to like me now, you will but\r\nlittle care to see or speak to me after my death, though I\r\nbelieve you may have that satisfaction.\" These were strange\r\nwords, but die, however, she did, and after her funeral she was\r\nrepeatedly seen in her earthly likeness, at home and abroad, by\r\nnight and by day. The resemblance, however, was in feature\r\nonly, for the conduct of the ghost was the antipodes to respec-*",
  "p0690.png": "*table. Mischief and wickedness seemed the prevailing instincts\r\nof the spectre. It would appear at noonday upon the quay at\r\nMinehead and cry, \"A boat! a boat, ho!\" and if any\r\nboatmen or seamen were in sight, and did not come, they\r\nwould be sure to be cast away, as, indeed, they would have been\r\nhad they obeyed the summons. It was equally dangerous to\r\nplease or displease her. Her son had several ships trading\r\nbetween England and Ireland; no sooner did they make land\r\nand come in sight of England, but this ghost would appear in\r\nthe same garb and likeness as when she was alive, and standing\r\nat the mainmast, would blow with a whistle, and though it were\r\nnever so great a calm, yet immediately there would arise a\r\ndreadful storm, that would break, wreck, and drown the ship and\r\ngoods; only the seamen would escape with their lives, the evil\r\nspirit had no permission to take them away. At this rate,\r\nby her frequent apparitions and disturbances, she ruined her\r\nson, and he that was once worth thousands was reduced to\r\npenury.\r\n\r\nSo deep, we are told, was the impression made by this story\r\non the inhabitants of Minehead, that the mariners belonging\r\nto the port often believed in stormy weather they heard the\r\nwhistle of the horrible old lady, who tormented even her own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAt Peel, in the Isle of Man, there is a tradition that a witch,\r\nwith a basin of water, said that the herring-fleet would never\r\nreturn. Every ship was lost, and she was put in a barrel with\r\nspikes, and rolled down the hill. The place of this horrible\r\npunishment was before covered with grass, but it has never\r\ngrown since.\r\n\r\nThe Evil One was supposed to have a direct influence on the\r\nwinds and waves. \"Our sailors,\" writes Dr. Pegge in 1763,\r\n\"I am told at this very day--I mean the vulgar sort of them--have\r\na strange opinion of satanic power and agency in stirring\r\nup winds, and that is the reason why they so seldom whistle on\r\nshipboard, esteeming it to be a mockery, and consequently an\r\nenraging of the devil. And it appears that even Zoroaster him-*",
  "p0700.png": "*self imagined that there was an evil spirit called Vato, that could\r\nexcite storms of wind.\"\r\n\r\nVarious practices were adopted to influence the winds, and\r\nensure prosperous passages to seamen. The good wives of\r\nWinchelsea, in former days, hit upon an ingenious plan of their\r\nown for this purpose; in the success of which they, no doubt,\r\nimplicitly believed. The Kentish perambulator, Lambarde,\r\nalluding to Winchelsea, says: \"And because our portes men\r\ntraded the sea, and lived by quicke returne, they were not unprovided\r\nwith an \u00c6olus also, that might directe the winde for\r\ntheir desire. For within memorie, there were standyng in Winchelsey\r\nthree parish churches--St. Lennard, St Giles, and St.\r\nThomas; and in that of St. Lennard there was erected the\r\npicture of St. Lennard, the patrone of the place, holding a fane\r\n(or \u00c6olus-scepter) in his hand, which was moovable at the\r\npleasure of any that would turne it to such pointe of the compasse,\r\nas best fitted the return of the husband, or other friend,\r\nwhom they expected.\" This was, at least, an innocent method\r\nof working the winds. The women of Roscoff, in Brittany,\r\nafter mass, sweep out the chapel \"de la Sainte Union,\" and\r\nblow the dust towards that side of the coast, by which their\r\nlovers and husbands should come to them; and they do this\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining a favourable wind for the objects\r\nof their affection.\r\n\r\nOne would scarcely expect that the mere turning of a stone\r\nwas supposed to have a sensible effect in procuring favourable\r\nbreezes, yet we learn that the inhabitants of Fladda Chuan, in\r\nthe Western Islands, had implicit faith in this charm. In a\r\nchapel on the island, there was a blue stone, fixed in the altar\r\nof a round form, which was always moist. It was an ordinary\r\ncustom with any fishermen who were detained in the island by\r\ncontrary winds, to wash this blue stone with water, expecting\r\nthereby to obtain a favourable wind. So great was the regard\r\npaid to this stone, that any oath sworn before it could never be\r\nbroken. Another mode of these primitive islanders to secure auspicious\r\nwinds, consisted in hanging a he-goat to the mast-head.",
  "p0710.png": "\r\nA similar feeling with regard to the efficacy of stones, though\r\nfor another purpose, existed among the fishermen of Iona.\r\nThis took the shape of a pillar, and the sailor who stretched his\r\narm along it three times in the name of the Trinity, could never\r\nerr in steering the helm of a vessel.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Gigha is a well with some stones in it; and\r\nit is affirmed that if the stones be taken out of it, a great storm\r\nwill arise.\r\n\r\nThe Finlanders are said to have used a cord, tied with three\r\nknots, for raising the wind. When the first was loosed, they\r\nwould expect a good wind; with the second, a stronger; on\r\nthe third being loosed, such a storm would arise that the sailors\r\nwould not be able to direct the ship, or avoid rocks, or to stand\r\nupon the decks.\r\n\r\nIn a \"History of Kintyre,\" by Peter McIntosh (Campbeltown,\r\n1870), we find: \"Old John McTaggart was a trader between\r\nKintyre and Ireland. Wishing to get a fair wind to waft his\r\nbark across to the Emerald Isle, he applied to an old woman\r\nwho was said to be able to give this. He received from her\r\ntwo strings, on each being three knots. He undid the first\r\nknot, and there blew a fine breeze. On opening the second,\r\nthe breeze became a gale. On nearing the Irish shore he\r\nloosed the third, and such a hurricane arose, that some of the\r\nhouses on shore were destroyed. On coming back to Kintyre,\r\nhe was careful to loose only two knots on the remaining\r\nstring.\"\r\n\r\nThe French seamen, in former days, had a comical notion\r\nthat the spirit of the storm was to be propitiated by flogging\r\nunfortunate middies at the mainmast.[*]\r\n\r\n* This brings to mind a paragraph in Galignani's newspaper (May,\r\n1856), relative to the inhabitants of Constantina, in Africa, who, during a\r\ngreat drought, had recourse to what they consider an infallible means of\r\nobtaining rain--the ceremony of ducking, with religious forms, in the\r\nnearest water, the half-witted creatures called Marabouts. Five or six of\r\nthese men were conveyed in procession to the Roumel, and there plunged\r\nin succession several times into the water, midst singing and shouting.\r\nOne of them who was unwilling to undergo the ordeal, was thrown into\r\nthe water by force, and when he came out, declared, in a passion, that no\r\nrain should fall for a year. Rain it did, however, on the next day.",
  "p0720.png": "\r\nSt. Gregory of Tours assures us that one of the nails of the\r\ncross on which Christ was crucified was thrown into the\r\nAdriatic by the Empress Helena during a storm (perhaps on\r\nher homeward passage from the East), in consequence of which\r\nsailors entered upon that sea as sanctified, with fastings, prayers,\r\nand singing hymns, even to his own day.\r\n\r\nOne of Baxter's tales is of \"an old reading parson, named\r\nJewis, not far from Framlingham, that was hanged; who confessed\r\nthat he had two imps, and that one of them was always\r\nputting him on doing mischief; and he being near the sea, as\r\nhe saw a ship under sail, it moved him to send him to sink the\r\nship, and he consented, and saw the ship sink before him.\" The\r\nclergyman was four-score years old, and his confession was obtained\r\nafter undergoing the ordeal of swimming, and made to\r\nwalk incessantly for several days and nights by the infamous\r\nHopkins, the witch-finder, and his gang.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hallywell, who follows \"Marcus the Eremite,\r\na skilful d\u00e6monist,\" there are six kinds of demons, the fourth of\r\nwhich \"are aquatic or watery, keeping their haunts about rivers,\r\nlakes, and springs, drowning men often, raising storms at sea,\r\nand sinking ships.\"\r\n\r\nCassas mentions a belief that the hurricanes so frequent in\r\nthe Gulf of Carnero were occasioned by sorcerers, who, when\r\noffended, kindled great fires in their caverns in the mountains;\r\nand that the earth, enraged with the pain which this occasioned,\r\nraised such commotions in the air as to cause the destruction\r\nof those against whom the sorcerers were wroth.\r\n\r\nMARINERS, in ancient times, considered the appearance\r\nof lightning playing amidst the masts, spars, and\r\ncordage of ships as ominous. A single flame was of evil\r\naugury, and took the name of \"Helena;\" while two flames\r\nsignified a successful voyage, and were termed \"Castor and\r\nPollux.\" Thus Horace alludes:\r\n\r\n\"Ad navim\r\nSic te diva potens Cypri\r\nSic fratres Helena, lucida sidera,\r\nVentorumque regat pater.\"",
  "p0730.png": "\r\nIn Lloyd's \"Stratagems of Jerusalem\" (1602) we read:\r\n\"Cabrias, the generall of Athens, being ready to strike a battell\r\non sea, it suddenly lightened, which so terrified the soldiers\r\nthat they were unwilling to fight, until Cabrias said that now\r\nthe time is to fight, when Jupiter himselfe with his lightening,\r\ndoth shewe he is ready to go before us.\"\r\n\r\nAriel, in the \"Tempest,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\r\nNow in the waist, the deck, in every cabin\r\nI flamed amazement; sometimes I'd divide,\r\nAnd burn in many places; on the top-mast,\r\nThe yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\r\nThen meet, and join.\"\r\n\r\nSt Elmo's light, which will be recognised in this description,\r\nis mentioned by Pliny in his \"Hist. Nat.,\" as also by Seneca,\r\nand other subsequent writers. Douce supposes that Shakspeare\r\nconsulted the works of Stephen Batman, who, speaking of\r\nCastor and Pollux, says: \"They were figured like two lamps,\r\nor cresset-lights, one on the toppe of a maste, the other on the\r\nstemme or foreshippe.\"\r\n\r\nFalconer alludes to this phenomenon:\r\n\r\n\"High on the mast, with pale and livid rays,\r\nAmid the gloom portentous meteors blaze.\"\r\n\r\nBy the superstition of later times these electrical phenomena\r\nhave been convened into indications of the guardian presence\r\nof St. Elmo, a patron saint of the sailor, hence called cuerpo\r\nsante by the Spanish mariners. During the second voyage of\r\nColumbus in the West Indies, a sudden gust of heavy wind\r\ncame on during the night, and his crew considered themselves\r\nin great peril, until they beheld several of these lambent flames\r\nplaying about the tops of the masts, and gliding along the\r\nrigging, which they hailed as the assurance that their supernatural\r\nprotector was near. Fernando Columbus records the\r\ncircumstance in a manner characteristic of the age in which he\r\nlived: \"On the same Saturday, in the night, was seen St.\r\nElmo, with seven lighted tapers, at the topmast. There was\r\nmuch rain and great thunder. I mean to say that those lights",
  "p0740.png": "were seen, which mariners affirm to be the body of St. Elmo,\r\nin beholding which, they chaunted many litanies and orisons,\r\nholding it for certain that in the tempest in which he appears\r\nno one is in danger.\"\r\n\r\nA similar mention is made of this nautical superstition in the\r\nvoyage of Magellan. During several great storms the presence\r\nof the saint was welcomed, appearing at the topmast with a\r\nlighted candle, and sometimes with two, upon which the\r\nsailors shed tears of joy, received great consolation, and\r\nsaluted him according to the custom of the Catholic seamen;\r\nbut he ungraciously vanished, disappearing with a great flash of\r\nlightning, which nearly blinded the crew.\r\n\r\nIn Fryer's \"Travels\" we read: \"In a storm of rain and\r\nhail, with a high and bleak wind, appeared the sailors' deities,\r\nCastor and Pollux, or the same it may be gave light to those\r\nfables, they boding fair weather to seamen, though never seen\r\nbut in storms, looking like a candle in a dark lantern, of which\r\nthere were divers here and there above the sails and shrouds,\r\nbeing the ignes fatui of the watery elements; by the Portugals\r\nchristened Querpos Santos, the bodies of saints, which by them\r\nare esteemed ominous. But I think I am not too positive in\r\nrelating them to be a meteor-like substance, exhaled in the day,\r\nand at night (for except then they show not themselves)\r\nkindled by the violent motion of the air, fixing themselves to\r\nthose parts of the ship that are most attractive; for I can\r\nwitness they usually spent themselves at the spindles of the\r\ntopmast-heads, or about the iron hoops of the yard-arms; and\r\nif any went towards them, they shifted always to some part of\r\nthe like nature.\"\r\n\r\nIn John Coad's \"Memorandum,\" it is stated that \"God was\r\npleased to give us a sign of the storm approaching by a\r\ncorposant on the top of the mainmast.\"\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall the phantom lights, called Jack Harry, are so\r\nnamed because he was the first man who was fooled by them.\r\nThey are generally observed before a gale, and the ship seen is\r\njust like the ship which is sure to be wrecked. On this subject",
  "p0750.png": "Mr. Hunt, in his \"Romances and Drolls of the West of England,\"\r\nrelates another version, which he received from an old\r\npilot: \"Some five years ago, on a Sunday night, the wind\r\nbeing strong, our crew heard of a large vessel in the offing,\r\nafter we came out of chapel. We manned our big boat, the\r\nArk--she was nearly new then--and away we went, under\r\nclose-reefed foresail and little mizen, the sea going over us at a\r\nsweet rate. The vessel stood just off the head, the wind blowing\r\nW.N.W. We had gone off four or five miles, and we\r\nthought we were up alongside, when lo! she slipped to\r\nwindward a league or more. Well, off we went after her, and\r\na good beating match we had too; but the Ark was a safe\r\ncraft, and we neared and neared till, as we thought, we got up\r\nclose. Away she whizzed in a minute, in along to Godrevy,\r\njust over the course we sailed; so we gave it up for \"Jack\r\nHarry's light,\" and with wet jackets and disappointed hopes,\r\nwe bore up for the harbour, prepared to hear of squalls, which\r\ncame heavier than ever next day. Scores of pilots have seen\r\nand been led a nice chase after them. They are just the same\r\nas the Flying Dutchman, seen off the Cape of Good Hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the month of June, 1808,\" says an observer, \"passing\r\nfrom the island of Ivica to that of Majorca, on board a Spanish\r\nMalacca ship, manned by about thirty Russians, Genoese,\r\nValencians, and Catalonians; a fine southerly gale, by seven in\r\nthe evening, brought us within six or seven leagues of the\r\nanchorage in Palma Bay. About this time, the sea-breeze\r\nfailing us astern, was shortly succeeded by light and baffling\r\nbreezes off the land. No sooner had the setting sun withdrawn\r\nhis golden beams from the top of the lofty hills which rise to\r\nthe westward of the town, than a thick and impenetrable cloud,\r\ngathering on the summit of Mount Galatzo, spread gradual\r\ndarkness on the hills below, and extended at length a premature\r\nobscurity along the very surface of the shore. About nine the\r\nship became becalmed. The darkness was intense, and\r\nrendered more sensible by the fire that gleamed upon the\r\nhorizon to the south, and aggravated by the deep-toned thunder",
  "p0760.png": "which rolled at intervals on the mountain, accompanied by the\r\nquick rapidity of that forked lightning, whose eccentric course\r\nand dire effects set all description at defiance. By half-past\r\nnine the hands were sent aloft to furl topgallant-sails and reef\r\nthe topsails, in preparation for the threatening storm. When\r\nretiring to rest, a sudden cry of 'St. Elmo' and 'St. Anne'\r\nwas heard from those aloft, and fore and aft the deck. An\r\ninterpreter called lustily down the hatchway that St. Elmo was\r\non board, and desired me to come up. A few steps were\r\nsufficient, and to my surprise I found the topsail-yards deserted,\r\nthe sails loose, and beating in the inconstant wind; the awestruck\r\nmariners, bare-headed, on their knees, with hands\r\nuplifted, in voice and attitude of prayer to St. Elmo and St.\r\nAnne. The lightning continued with undiminished intensity\r\nfor ten minutes, when it disappeared, and the seamen, sure of\r\ntheir preservation, finished the work they had left undone.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of the \"Memoirs of Count de Forbin,\" describing\r\na storm at sea, remarks: \"We saw about different parts of the\r\nship upwards of thirty St. Elmo's fires, and among the rest,\r\nthere was one upon the top of the vane of the mainmast more\r\nthan a foot in height. I ordered one of the soldiers to take it\r\ndown. When he was on the top, he heard the fire, and stated\r\nthat its noise resembled that of fired wet gunpowder. I ordered\r\nhim to lower the vane and come down, but scarcely had he\r\ntaken the vane from its place, when the fire fixed itself on the\r\ntop of the mast, from which it was impossible to remove it.\"\r\n\r\nSailors superstitiously believed that so long as this light\r\nshone on the mast-head, the vessel was under the friendly\r\nguidance of this aerial demigod; but if it descended, a gale of\r\nwind or some other disaster would happen, the severity of\r\nwhich they considered indicated by the depth of its descent.\r\nThe hissing noise described by the soldier, as above narrated,\r\ncan be easily accounted for.\r\n\r\nAubrey tells us that when any Christian is drowned in the\r\nRiver Dee, there will appear over the place where the corpse is\r\na light, by which means the body is found.",
  "p0770.png": "\r\nSacheverell, in his \"Account of the Isle of Man,\" relates that\r\n\"Captain Leather, chief magistrate of Belfast in the year 1690,\r\nwho had been previously shipwrecked on the coast of Man,\r\nassured him that when he landed after shipwreck, several\r\npeople told him that he had lost thirteen men, for they had\r\nseen so many lights move towards the churchyard, which was\r\nexactly the number of the drowned.\"\r\n\r\nWATER-SPOUTS at sea were regarded by the ancients\r\nwith great terror. The Greeks applied the term Prester\r\nto them, signifying a \"fiery fluid,\" from their appearance being\r\ngenerally accompanied with flashes of lightning and a sulphurous\r\nsmell, showing the activity of the electrical principle in the\r\nair. Lucretius says:\r\n\r\n\"Hence, with much ease the meteor we may trace,\r\nTermed from its essence, Prester, by the Greeks.\"\r\n\r\nThe mariners of former days were accustomed to discharge\r\nartillery at these moving columns to accelerate their fall, fearful\r\nof their ships being crossed by them and sunk or damaged.\r\nThis practice is alluded to by Falconer, in the opening of the\r\nsecond canto of the \"Shipwreck;\" but the principal danger\r\narises from the wind blowing in sudden gusts in their vicinity,\r\nfrom all points of the compass, sufficient to capsize small\r\nvessels carrying much sail.\r\n\r\nCamoens, in his \"Lusiad\" (book v.), describing a water-spout\r\nin the Indian Ocean, expresses his surprise that the water which\r\nhe had seen drawn up salt from the ocean should, a few minutes\r\nafterwards, fall fresh from the cloud which attracted it:\r\n\r\n\"But say, ye sages, who can weigh the cause,\r\nAnd trace the secret springs of nature's laws;\r\nSay, why the wave, of bitter brine erewhile,\r\nShould to the bosom of the deep recoil,\r\nRobb'd of its salt; and from the cloud distil\r\nSweet as the waters of the limpid rill.\"\r\n\r\nA superstitious practice was considered efficacious in dissipating\r\nwater-spouts at sea. Th\u00e9v\u00e9not, in his \"Travels into the\r\nLevant\" (1687), mentions that \"one of the ship's company",
  "p0780.png": "kneels down by the mainmast, and, holding in one hand a\r\nknife with a black handle (without which seamen never go on\r\nboard for that reason), he reads the Gospel of St. John; and\r\nwhen he comes to pronounce those holy words, 'Et verbum\r\ncaro factum est, et habitavit in nobis,' the mariner turns towards\r\nthe water-spout, and with his knife cuts the air athwart\r\nthat spout, as if he would cut it; and they say that it then is\r\nreally cut, and lets all the water it holds fall with a great noise.\"\r\nIf the water-spout happened to be in an obstinate mood, and\r\ntook no notice of these antics, two sailors would draw their\r\nswords and strike each other in true gladiatorial style, taking\r\ncare between each blow to make the sign of the cross.[*]\r\n\r\nDuring the voyages of Columbus, the mariners were terrified\r\nat the water-spouts; and despairing of all human means to\r\navert them, repeated passages from St John the Evangelist;\r\nand when the spouts passed close to the ships without injuring\r\nthem, the trembling crew attributed their escape to the miraculous\r\nefficacy of their quotations from the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nTHE Sea-Dogs that kept guard at Scylla and Charybdis\r\nhad their counterpart at Baruch, where, as Th\u00e9v\u00e9not\r\nrelates, \"there is a river called the 'Dog's River,' beyond\r\ndoubt; because there is a ring cut into the rock, to which is\r\nfastened a dog, cut in the same rock, and which would bark\r\n\r\n* In Purchas (1646), we find how whirlwinds, called dragons, were dispersed\r\nby the beating of new swords crossways. \"Often they see come\r\nafar off great whirlwinds, which the mariners call dragons; if this passeth\r\nover their ship, it bruiseth them and overwhelmeth them in the waves.\r\nWhen the mariners see them come, they take new swords, and beat one\r\nagainst the other in a cross upon the prow, or toward the coast from\r\nwhence the storm comes and hold that this hinders it from coming over\r\ntheir ship, and turneth it aside.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice that the Russian peasant (according to Mr.\r\nRalston) generally attributes high winds to the wild dances in which the\r\ndevil indulges when celebrating his marriage with a witch; but sometimes\r\nhe thinks a wizard is being whirled about in the \"dust-spouts\" which may\r\nbe seen in summer, in the open plains. And so, if a sharp knife be thrown\r\nwith good aim at one of them, it will fall to the ground streaming with\r\nblood. There is a little Russian story of a peasant who flung his hatchet at\r\none of these revolving columns, in which it stuck \"just as it were in a\r\ntree,\" and by which it was carried off into space.",

Thor, the god of thunder,\r\nassisted sailors against Rau, a wicked spirit, who, with his nine\r\ndaughters, sought to overwhelm them in the sea. As late as\r\nthe eighteenth century the Norwegian mariners, and even those\r\nof Shetland, when at sea, did not dare to name the objects\r\nused in their fishing for fear of exciting the attention or the\r\ncovetousness of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Ocean was regarded by the Scandinavians with\r\ngreat terror, as the region of enchantments and gloom. It was\r\ncalled by them Dumslaf, or Dumb Sea, and Trollebotin, or the\r\nEnchanted Gulf.",
  "p0800.png": "\r\nTHE Fata Morgana, aerial castles, fairy isles, or green isles\r\nof the ocean, are superstitions familiar to most readers,\r\nand may be classed in the same category of seamen's delusions\r\nas the \"Spectre Ship.\" Mrs. Hemans, in her sweet and touching\r\npoesy, has alluded to these deceptions of the eye and\r\nfancy:\r\n\r\n\"Where are they, those green fairy islands reposing\r\nIn sunlight and beauty on ocean's calm breast?\r\nWhat spirit, the things that are hidden disclosing,\r\nShall point the bright way to their dwellings of rest?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, lovely they rose on the dreams of past ages,\r\nThe mighty have sought them, undaunted in faith,\r\nBut the land hath been sad for her warriors and sages,\r\nFor the guide to these realms of the blessed--is Death!\r\n\r\n\"Where are they, the high-minded children of glory,\r\nWho steer'd for those distant green spots on the wave?\r\nTo the winds of the ocean they left their wild story,\r\nIn the field of their country they found not a grave.\r\n\r\n\"Perchance they repose where the summer-breeze gathers,\r\nFrom the flow'rs of each vale, immortality's breath;\r\nBut their steps shall be ne'er on the hills of their fathers,\r\nFor the guide to those realms of the blessed--is Death!\"\r\n\r\nThe green isles of the ocean, however, were supposed to be\r\nthe abode of the souls of virtuous Druids, who could not enter\r\nthe Christian heaven, but were permitted to enjoy this paradise\r\nof their own. Gafran, a distinguished British chieftain of the\r\nfifth century, went on a voyage with his family to discover\r\nthese islands, but they never returned.\r\n\r\nMr. W. K. Kelly remarks that the Northern nations believed\r\ntheir dead crossed the water in boats and ships; and so far\r\nwere they from expecting the passage to be always effected over\r\na bridge, that in Scandinavia bodies were burned in ships.\r\nThis was manifestly done with the intention that the dead\r\nshould have means at hand to carry them over whatever water\r\nthey might come to on their journey. The Norse story of the\r\ndeath of Baldr tells how the \u00c6sir raised his funeral pile on\r\nboard the ship, laid his body upon it, and committed the\r\nblazing vessel to the waves. The corpse of the deified hero,\r\nScild, was placed in a ship which was wafted away by the sea,",
  "p0810.png": "no one knows whither. Sigmundr carried the body of his\r\nbeloved son, Sinfi\u00f6tli, to the sea-shore, where a man with a\r\nsmall boat offered it a passage. Sigmundr laid the body in the\r\nboat, which had then its full lading; the unknown boatman\r\npushed off from the shore, and floated away with the corpse.\r\nFrotho's law specified how many bodies of warriors, from one\r\nto ten, according to the rank of the deceased, should be burned\r\nin one ship. A Swedish popular legend tells of a golden ship\r\nlying underground in Runemad, on board of which Odin\r\nconveyed the slain in Br\u00e2valla to Valhalla. \"Did the belief\r\nprevail,\" says Grimm, \"that the body abandoned to the sacred\r\nsea and to the winds would arrive by itself at the land of death\r\nto which no human hand could guide it?\"\r\n\r\nProcopius relates a legend of the Island of Brittia, the\r\nsubstance of which is given by Sir Walter Scott in his \"Count\r\nRobert of Paris.\" \"I have read,\" says Agelastes, \"in that\r\nbrilliant mirror which reflects the times of our fathers, the\r\nvolumes of the learned Procopius, that beyond Gaul, and nearly\r\nopposite to it, but separated by an arm of the sea, lies a ghastly\r\nregion, on which clouds and tempests for ever rest, and which\r\nis known to its continental neighbours as the abode to which\r\ndeparted spirits are sent after this life. On one side of the\r\nstrait dwell a few fishermen, men possessed of a strange\r\ncharacter, and enjoying singular privileges in consideration of\r\ntheir being the living ferrymen, who, performing the office of\r\nthe heathen Charon, carry the spirits of the departed to the\r\nisland, which is their residence after death. They are, in\r\nrotation, summoned to perform the duty by which they seem to\r\nhold possession to reside on this strange coast.\" Brittia, according\r\nto Procopius, lay not further than two hundred stadia from\r\nthe coast between Britannia and Thale (the Scandinavian\r\npeninsula), opposite the mouth of the Rhine, and was inhabited\r\nby the Augili, the Frissones, and the Brittones. By Britannia\r\nhe means the western portion of Gaul, one end of which is now\r\ncalled Bretagne, but which extended in the sixth century over\r\nwhat was afterwards Normandy and Frisian Flanders to the",
  "p0820.png": "mouths of the Scheldt and the Rhine. His Brittia is generally\r\nbelieved to be Great Britain, but this has been made a matter\r\nof controversy. In Germany, it was of old an established\r\nbelief, that Britain was the island of souls, and such, to this\r\nday, it is still held under its new name of England.\r\n\r\nAmong the many half-pagan legends that were connected\r\nwith Ireland during the middle ages, one of the most beautiful\r\nis that of the islands of life and death. In a certain lake in\r\nMunster, it is said there were two islands; into the first, death\r\ncould never enter, but age and sickness, and the weariness of\r\nlife, and the paroxysms of fearful suffering were all known there,\r\nand they did their work till the inhabitants, tired of their immortality,\r\nlearned to look upon the opposite island as upon a haven\r\nof repose; they launched their barks upon the gloomy waters;\r\nthey touched its shore, and they were at rest.\r\n\r\nTHE Phantom Ship has long been a favourite subject with\r\nstory-writers, and a belief in the appearance of this\r\nsupernatural phenomenon prevailed among seamen of various\r\ncountries for a considerable period. The Dutch claim the\r\norigin of the superstition, and the Flying Dutchman had no\r\nfirmer votaries in favour of its existence than English sailors.\r\nThere were few ships that \"doubled the Cape,\" but had among\r\nthe crews some who had seen this marvel. Sir Walter Scott\r\nalludes to it as a harbinger of woe.\r\n\r\n\"Nor less his wild adventurous youth\r\nBeliev'd in every legend's truth;\r\nLearn'd when beneath the tropic gale\r\nFull swell'd the vessel's steady sail.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\nOr, of that Phantom Ship whose form\r\nShoots like a meteor through the storm,\r\nWhen the dark scud comes driving hard,\r\nAnd lower'd is ev'ry topsail yard,\r\nAnd canvas wove in earthly looms,\r\nNo more to brave the storm presumes!\r\nThen, 'mid the war of sen and sky,\r\nTop and top-gallant hoisted high,",
  "p0830.png": "Full spread and crowded every sail,\r\nThe demon-frigate braves the gale,\r\nAnd well the doom'd spectators know\r\nThe harbinger of wreck and woe!\"\r\n\r\nThe legend of the Flying Dutchman runs, that she is supposed\r\nto be seen about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nis distinguished from earthly vessels by bearing a press of sail,\r\nwhen all others are unable, from stress of weather, to show an\r\ninch of canvas. The cause of her wandering is not at all\r\ncertain, but the general account is, that she was originally a\r\nvessel loaded with great wealth, on board of which some horrid\r\nact of murder and piracy had been committed; that the plague\r\nbroke out among the wicked crew who had perpetrated the\r\ncrime, and that they sailed in vain from port to port, offering,\r\nas the price of shelter, the whole of their ill-gotten wealth; that\r\nthey were excluded from every harbour, for fear of the contagion\r\nwhich was devouring them; and that, as a punishment of their\r\ncrimes, the apparition of the ship still continues to haunt those\r\nseas in which the catastrophe took place, and is considered by\r\nthe mariners as the worst of all possible omens.\r\n\r\nThe Phantom Ship was an object of firm belief to the\r\nNorman fishermen. If the prayers offered for the souls in\r\npurgatory of those who had been shipwrecked had not been\r\nefficacious, the result is said to have been as follows: a tempest\r\nwould arise, and a ship be seen at sea, struggling with the winds\r\nand waves. Suddenly the vessel would be driven with lightning\r\nrapidity towards the port, and on entering, the horrified\r\nspectators on the quay would recognise in the ship those who\r\nhad been reported lost at sea years before. Assistance would\r\nbe given to bring the ship into a safe place; ropes were thrown\r\non board, which were caught by the crew, and the vessel was\r\nattached to the quay. The news would spread, and the widows,\r\nand children, and friends of the seamen who were supposed to\r\nhave been drowned, would rush to the spot. The cries of\r\nrecognition would arise, \"There is my father, my brother, or\r\nmy lover.\" No answer, however, would be heard from the\r\nvessel; not one cry from the crew, although the figures might",
  "p0840.png": "be seen; not a lip moved, nor was any sign of recognition\r\nheard. At length the bells would sound the hour of midnight;\r\na fog would steal over the sea, and on clearing off after a few\r\nmoments, the vessel had disappeared. Amidst the sobs and\r\nthe heart-rending bitterness of the spectators of the Phantom\r\nShip, the warning voice of a priest would be heard, \"Pay your\r\ndebts; pray for the lost souls in purgatory!\"\r\n\r\nThere is a legend of a Herr von Falkenbeg, who is condemned\r\nto beat about the ocean until the day of judgment, on\r\nboard a ship without a helm, or steersman, playing at dice for\r\nhis soul with the devil. Seamen traversing the German Ocean\r\noften, it is said, met with the infernal vessel. It was probably\r\nno uncommon occurrence in early times for seafarers to fall in\r\nwith ships abandoned to the winds and waves, with corpses on\r\nboard, and out of such encounters may have grown this legend\r\nof Falkenbeg, that of the Flying Dutchman, and others of the\r\nsame kind.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt relates the following Cornish tradition of the\r\n\"Spectre Ship:\"\r\n\r\n\"Years long ago, one night a gig's crew was called to go off\r\nto a 'hobble' to the westward of St. Ive's Head. No sooner\r\nwas one boat launched, than several others put off from the\r\nshore, and a stiff chase was maintained, each one being eager\r\nto get to the ship, as she had the appearance of a foreign trader.\r\nThe hull was clearly visible; she was a schooner-rigged vessel,\r\nwith a light over her bows.\r\n\r\n\"Away they pulled, and the boat which had been first\r\nlaunched still kept ahead by dint of mechanical power and\r\nskill. All the men had thrown off their jackets to row with\r\nmore freedom. At length the helmsman cried out: 'Stand\r\nready to board her.' The sailor rowing the bow oar slipped it\r\nout of the row-lock, and stood on the forethought, taking his\r\njacket on his arm, ready to spring aboard. The vessel came so\r\nclose to the boat, that they could see the men, and the bow-oar\r\nman made a grasp at the bulwarks. His hand found nothing\r\nsolid, and he fell, being caught by one of his mates, back into",
  "p0850.png": "the boat, instead of into the water. Then ship and lights disappeared.\r\nThe next morning the Neptune of London, Captain\r\nRichard Grant, was wrecked at Gwithian, and all perished.\r\nThe captain's body was picked up after a few days, and that of\r\nhis son also. They were both buried in Gwithian churchyard.\"\r\n\r\nIN Coleridge's splendid \"Rime,\" the ancient mariner beholds\r\na sign in the element afar off, prefiguring the death of himself\r\nand his comrades. It is a \"spectre ship,\" in which Death\r\nand Life-in-death dice for the crew, and she wins the mariner:\r\n\r\n\"Her lips were red, her looks were free,\r\nHer locks were yellow as gold;\r\nHer skin was white as leprosy,\r\nThe night-mare Life-in-death was she,\r\nWho thicks man's blood with cold.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the crew, their bodies are animated by \"a\r\ntroop of spirits blest,\" who leave them every morning, not\r\nvisibly, but in music:\r\n\r\n\"For when it dawn'd--they dropped their arms,\r\nAnd cluster'd round the mast;\r\nSweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\r\nAnd from their bodies pass'd.\r\n\r\n\"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,\r\nThen darted to the sun;\r\nSlowly the sounds came back again,\r\nNow mixed, now one by one.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes adropping from the sky,\r\nI heard the sky-lark sing.\r\nSometimes all little birds that are,\r\nHow they seemed to fill the sea and air\r\nWith their sweet jargoning!\r\n\r\n\"And now 'twas like all instruments,\r\nNow like a lonely flute;\r\nAnd now it is an angel's song\r\nThat makes the heavens be mute.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful conceptions of a saintly apparition\r\nat sea, is given by Dante. The translation, by the late Leigh\r\nHunt, is worthy the original. Dante and his guide Virgil have\r\njust left the infernal regions, and are lingering on a solitary seashore\r\nin purgatory:",
  "p0860.png": "\r\n\"That solitary shore we still kept on,\r\nLike men, who musing on their journey, stay\r\nAt rest in body, yet in heart are gone;\r\nWhen lo! at the early dawn of day,\r\nRed Mars looks deepening through the foggy heat,\r\nDown in the west, far o'er the watery way;\r\nSo did mine eyes behold (so may they yet)\r\nA light which came so swiftly o'er the sea,\r\nThat never wing with such a fervour beat.\r\nI did but turn to ask what it might be\r\nOf my sage leader, when its orb had got\r\nMore large meanwhile, and came more gloriously;\r\nAnd by degrees I saw I knew not what\r\nOf white about; and beneath the white\r\nAnother. My great master uttered not\r\nOne word till those first issuing candours bright\r\nFanned into wings; but soon as he had found\r\nWho was the mighty voyager now in sight,\r\nHe cried aloud, \"Down, down, upon the ground,\r\nIt is God's Angel.\"\r\n\r\nAPPARITIONS have been always a fruitful source of\r\nterror to seamen. In the \"New Catalogue of Vulgar\r\nErrors\" (1767), we read: \"I look upon our sailors to care as\r\nlittle what becomes of themselves, as any set of people under\r\nthe sun; yet no persons are so much terrified at the thought of\r\nan apparition. Their sea-songs are full of them; they firmly\r\nbelieve their existence, and honest Jack Tar shall be more\r\nfrightened at the glimmering of the moon upon the tackling of\r\nthe ship, than he would be if a Frenchman were to place a\r\nblunderbuss at his head.\"\r\n\r\nAbout half-a-dozen sailors on board a man-of-war, took it in\r\ntheir heads that there was a ghost in the ship; and being asked\r\nby the captain what reason they had to apprehend such a thing,\r\nthey said they were sure of it, because they smelt him. The\r\ncaptain laughed at them, and called them a parcel of lubbers.\r\nOne night they came again to the captain, and said that the\r\nghost was behind the beer-barrels. The captain, enraged at their\r\nfolly, ordered the boatswain's mate to give them a dozen lashes,\r\nwhich entirely cleared the ship of the ghost during the remainder\r\nof the voyage. However, when the barrels were removed some\r\ntime after, a dead rat was found which had given rise to the story.",
  "p0870.png": "\r\nBrand mentions that the cook of a vessel belonging to Newcastle-upon\r\nTyne[**Newcastle-upon-Tyne?], died on a homeward passage. The man had\r\none of his legs shorter than the other, which gave him a peculiarity\r\nof gait when he walked. A few nights after the body\r\nhad been committed to the deep, the captain was alarmed by\r\nthe mate assuring him that the man was walking before the\r\nship, and all the crew came on deck to see him. On coming\r\nforward, the captain certainly saw something that seemed to\r\nmove as the cook was accustomed to walk, and he ordered the\r\nship to be steered towards the object. The crew were in a\r\npanic. It was found, however, on a near approach, that the\r\nridiculous cause of all this terror was part of a maintop, the\r\nremains of some wreck, floating before them.\r\n\r\nA ghost story, with a more tragical result, is related by Sir\r\nWalter Scott, in his \"Demonology and Witchcraft.\" A sailor\r\nhad in his youth become mate in a slave vessel from Liverpool,\r\nof which town he was a native. The captain of the ship was a\r\nman of variable temper, sometimes kind and courteous to his\r\nmen, but subject to fits of humour, dislike, and passion, during\r\nwhich he was very violent, tyrannical, and cruel. He took a\r\nparticular dislike to one seaman on board, an elderly man,\r\ncalled Bill Jones, or some such name. He seldom spoke to the\r\nperson without threats and abuse, which the old man, with the\r\nlicense which sailors take in merchant vessels, was very apt to\r\nreturn. On one occasion, Bill Jones appeared slow in getting\r\non the yard. The captain, according to custom, abused the\r\nseaman as a lubberly rascal, who got fat by leaving other people\r\nto do his duty. The man made a saucy answer, almost\r\namounting to mutiny, on which, in a towering passion, the captain\r\nran down to his cabin, and returned with a blunderbuss\r\nloaded with slugs, with which he took deliberate aim at the\r\nsupposed mutineer, fired, and mortally wounded him. The\r\nman was carried down from the yard, and stretched on the\r\ndeck, evidently dying. He fixed his eyes on the captain, and\r\nsaid: \"Sir, you have done for me, but I will never leave you.\"\r\nThe captain, in return, swore at him for a fat lubber, and said",
  "p0880.png": "he would have him thrown into the slave-kettle, where they\r\nmade food for the negroes, and see how much fat he had got.\r\nThe man died, and his body was actually thrown into the slave-kettle,\r\nand the sailor who related this story observed, with a\r\nna\u00efvet\u00e9 which confirmed the extent of his own belief in the\r\ntruth of what he told, \"there was not much fat about him after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain told the crew they must keep absolute silence\r\non the subject of what had passed; and as the mate was not\r\nwilling to give an explicit and absolute promise, he ordered him\r\nto be confined below. A day or two afterwards the captain\r\ncame to the mate, and demanded if he had an intention to\r\ndeliver him up for trial when the vessel reached home. The\r\nmate, who was tired of close confinement in that sultry climate,\r\nspoke his commander fair, and obtained his liberty. When\r\nhe mingled among the crew once more, he found them impressed\r\nwith the idea, not unnatural in their position, that the\r\nghost of the dead man appeared amongst them when they had\r\na spell of duty, especially if a sail was to be handled, on which\r\noccasion the spectre was sure to be out upon the yard before\r\nany of the crew. The narrator had seen the apparition frequently;\r\nhe believed the captain saw it also, but he took no\r\nnotice of it for some time, and the crew, terrified at the violent\r\ntemper of the man, dared not call his attention to it. Thus\r\nthey held on their course homeward, with great fear and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nAt length, the captain invited the mate, who was now in a\r\nsort of favour, to go down to the cabin and take a glass of grog\r\nwith him. In this interview he assumed a very grave and\r\nanxious aspect. \"I need not tell you, Jack,\" he said, \"what\r\nsort of hands we have got on board with us; he told me he\r\nwould never leave me, and he has kept his word. You only see\r\nhim now and then, but he is always at my side, and never out\r\nof sight. At this very moment I see him. I am determined\r\nto bear it no longer, and I have resolved to leave you.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate replied that his leaving the vessel while out of",
  "p0890.png": "sight of any land was impossible. He suggested that if the\r\ncaptain apprehended any danger or bad consequences from\r\nwhat had happened, he should run for the west of Ireland, or\r\nFrance, and there go ashore, and leave him, the mate, to carry\r\nthe vessel to Liverpool. The captain only shook his head\r\ngloomily, and reiterated his determination to leave the ship.\r\nAt this moment the mate was called to the deck for some\r\npurpose or other; and the instant he got up the companion-ladder,\r\nhe heard a splash, and, looking over the ship's side, he\r\nsaw that the captain had thrown himself into the sea from the\r\nquarter-gallery, and was swimming astern at the rate of six\r\nknots an hour. When just about to sink, he seemed to make\r\na last exertion--sprang half out of the water, and clasped his\r\nhands towards the mate, exclaiming, \"Bill is with me now!\"\r\nand then sank, to be seen no more.\r\n\r\nThis story leads to the inference that the naturally superstitious\r\nminds of the seamen would readily conjure up an\r\napparition following a deed so truly horrible, in which the\r\nperpetrator would share, and madness or remorse would lead to\r\nthe final catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIn Blackwood's Magazine for 1840, there is a letter which\r\ncontains the following statement: \"The Hawk being on her\r\npassage from the Cape of Good Hope towards the island of\r\nJava, and myself having the charge of the middle-watch, between\r\none and two in the morning I was taken suddenly ill,\r\nwhich obliged me to send for the officer next in turn. I then\r\nwent down on the gun-deck, and sent my boy for a light. In\r\nthe meanwhile I sat down on a chest in the steerage, under the\r\nafter-grating, when I felt a gentle squeeze by a very cold hand.\r\nI started and saw a figure in white. Stepping back, I said,\r\n'God's my life!--who is that?' It stood and gazed at me a\r\nshort time, stooped its head to get a more perfect view, sighed\r\naloud, repeated the exclamation, 'Oh!' three times, and instantly\r\nvanished. The night was fine, though the moon\r\nafforded through the gratings but a weak light, so that little of\r\nfeature could be seen, only a figure rather tall than otherwise,",
  "p0900.png": "and white-clad. My boy returning now with a light, I sent\r\nhim to the cabins of all the officers, when he brought me word\r\nthat not one of them had been stirring. Coming afterwards to\r\nSt. Helena, homeward-bound, hearing of my sister's death, and\r\nfinding the time so nearly coinciding, it added much to my painful\r\nconcern; and I have only to thank God that, when I saw\r\nwhat I verily believe to have been her apparition (my sister\r\nAnn), I did not then know the melancholy occasion of it.'\"\r\nAs in all similar cases, we see the effect of superstitious feelings\r\nacting, no doubt, on a nervous temperament.\r\n\r\nIn Sandys's \"Ovid\" we find a curious story of the power of\r\nsuperstition, with, unfortunately, barbarous results: \"I have\r\nheard of seafaring men, and some of Bristol, how a quarter-master\r\nin a Bristol ship, then trading in the Streights, going\r\ndown into the hold, saw a sort of women, his knowne neighbours,\r\nmaking merry together, and taking their cups liberally;\r\nwho, having espied him, and threatening that he should repent\r\ntheir discovery, vanished suddenly out of sight, who thereupon\r\nwas lame for ever after. The ship having made her voyage,\r\nnowe homeward-bound, and neere her harbour, stuck fast in\r\nthe deepe sea, before a fresh gaile, to their no small amazement;\r\nnor for all they could doe, together with the helpe that\r\ncame from the shoare, could they get her loose, until one (as\r\nCymothoe, the Trojan ship) shoved her off with his shoulder\r\n(perhaps one of those whom they vulgarly call Wisemen, who\r\ndoe good a bad way and undoe the enchantments of others).\r\nAt their arrivall, the quarter-master accused these women, who\r\nwere arraigned and convicted by their owne confession, for\r\nwhich five-and-twenty were executed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Byron,\" says Moore in his \"Life\" of the poet, \"used\r\nsometimes to mention a strange story which the commander of\r\nthe packet, Captain Kidd, related to him on the passage.\r\nThis officer stated that, being asleep one night in his berth,\r\nhe was awakened by the pressure of something heavy on his\r\nlimbs, and, there being a faint light in the room, could see, as\r\nhe thought, distinctly the figure of his brother, who was at that",
  "p0910.png": "time in the same service, in the East Indies, dressed in his\r\nuniform, and stretched across the bed. Concluding it to be\r\nan illusion of his senses, he shut his eyes, and made an effort to\r\nsleep. But still the same pressure continued; and still, as often\r\nas he ventured to take another look, he saw the figure lying\r\nacross him in the same position. To add to the wonder, on\r\nputting his hand forth to touch this form, he found the uniform\r\nin which it appeared to be dressed, dripping wet. On the\r\nentrance of one of his brother officers, to whom he called out\r\nin alarm, the apparition vanished; but in a few months afterwards,\r\nhe received the startling intelligence that on that night\r\nhis brother had been drowned in the Indian seas. Of the\r\nsupernatural character of this appearance, Captain Kidd himself\r\ndid not appear to have the slightest doubt.\r\n\r\nCARRYING dead bodies in ships has always been a sore\r\npoint with sailors, who regard the omen derived from\r\nthence as disastrous. In the travels of Boullaye le Gouz\r\n(published in 1657), he says: \"I had among my baggage the\r\nhand of a syren, or fisherwoman, which I threw, on the sly,\r\ninto the sea, because the captain, seeing that we could not\r\nmake way, asked me if I had not got some mummy or other\r\nin my bags which hindered our progress, in which case we\r\nmust return to Egypt to carry it back again. Most of the\r\nProven\u00e7als have the opinion that vessels which transport the\r\nmummies from Egypt have great difficulty in arriving safe at\r\nport; so that I feared, lest coming to search among my goods,\r\nthey might take the hand of this fish for a mummy's hand and\r\ninsult me on account of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuller, in his \"Holy Warre,\" says of St Louis: \"His body\r\nwas carried into France, there to be buried, and was most\r\nmiserably tossed; it being observed that the sea cannot digest\r\nthe crudity of a dead corpse, being a due debt to be interred\r\nwhere it dieth, and a ship cannot abide to be made a bier of.\"\r\n\r\nIn a \"Helpe to Memory and Discourse\" (1639), the question\r\nis asked, \"Whether doth a dead body in a shippe cause the",
  "p0920.png": "shippe to sail slower, and, if it doe, what is thought to be the\r\nreason thereof?\" The answer is, \"The shippe is as insensible\r\nof the living as the dead; and as the living make it goe the\r\nfaster, so the dead make it not goe the slower; for the dead\r\nare no Rhemoras, to alter the course of her passsage,[** typo? passage] though\r\nsome there be that thinke so, and that by a kind of mournful\r\nsympathy.\"\r\n\r\nA coffin, made of the mainmast of the French ship L'Orient,\r\nwas sent to Nelson by a brother sailor, to remind him that,\r\namidst all the glory that attended him, he was but mortal.\r\nNelson received the present in a proper spirit, and had the\r\ncoffin placed in his own cabin in the Vanguard; but at length,\r\nin compliance with the superstitious feelings of his crew, he\r\nordered the monitor of mortality to be sent below.\r\n\r\nSOME of my readers may have heard of the \"Bay of the\r\nDeparted,\" on the coast of Brittany, where, in the dead\r\nhour of night, the boatmen are summoned by some unseen\r\npower to launch their boats and ferry over to a sacred island\r\nthe souls of men who have been drowned in the surging waters.\r\nThe fishermen tell that on the occasion of those midnight\r\nfreights, the boat is so crowded with invisible passengers as to\r\nsink quite low in the water, and the wails and cries of the ship-*wrecked\r\nare heard as the melancholy voyage progresses. On\r\ntheir arrival at the island of Sein, invisible beings are said to\r\nnumber the invisible passengers, and the wondering, awe-struck\r\ncrew then return to await the next supernatural summons, to\r\nboat over the ghosts to the storied isle, which was of old the\r\nchief haunt of the druidesses in Brittany.\r\n\r\nA similar story is told at Guildo, on the same coast; small\r\nskiffs, phantom ones, it is believed, dart out from under the\r\ncastle cliffs, manned by phantom figures, ferrying over the\r\ntreacherous sands the spirits whose bodies lie engulfed in the\r\nneighbourhood; not one of the native population--so strong is\r\nthe dread of the scene--will pass the spot after nightfall.\r\n\r\n\"Fishermen,\" says Mr. Hunt, \"dread to walk at night near",
  "p0930.png": "those parts of the shore where there have been wrecks. The\r\nsouls of the drowned sailors appear to haunt those spots, and\r\nthe 'calling of the dead' has frequently been heard. I have\r\nbeen told that under certain circumstances, especially before\r\nthe coming of storms, or at certain seasons, but always at night,\r\nthese callings are common. Many a fisherman has declared\r\nthat he has heard the voices of dead sailors 'hailing their own\r\nnames.'\r\n\r\n\"A fisherman or a pilot was walking one night on the sands\r\nof Porth-Towan, when all was still save the monotonous fall of\r\nthe light waves upon the sand. He distinctly heard a voice\r\nfrom the sea, exclaiming: 'The hour is come, but not the man.'\r\nThis was repeated three times, when a black figure, like that of\r\na man, rushed impetuously down the steep incline over the\r\nsands, and was lost in the sea. In different forms the story is\r\ntold all around the Cornish coast.\"\r\n\r\nA belief prevails among the fishermen on the Norfolk coast,\r\nthat when any person is drowned, a voice is heard from the\r\nwater, ominous of a squall.\r\n\r\nLord Teignmouth, in his \"Reminiscences of Many Years,\"\r\nalluding to Ullesvang, in Norway (1830), remarks: \"A very\r\nnatural belief that the voice of a person drowned is heard\r\nwailing amidst the storm, is, apparently, the only acknowledged\r\nremnant of ancient superstition still lingering along the shores\r\nof the fiords.\"\r\n\r\nIn China, a reluctance to rescue persons from drowning arises\r\nfrom a superstitious dread. It is believed that the spirit of a\r\nperson who has been drowned continues to flit along the surface\r\nof the water, until it has caused, by drowning, the death of a\r\nfellow-creature. A person, therefore, who attempts to rescue\r\nanother from drowning is supposed to incur the hatred of the\r\nuneasy spirit, which is desirous, even at the expense of a man's\r\nlife, to escape from its unceasing wandering.\r\n\r\nThis superstitious dread of saving a drowning man used also\r\nto prevail in Shetland, and other islands in the north-east of\r\nScotland. It was owing to the belief that the person saved",
  "p0940.png": "would, sooner or later, do an injury to the man who saved him.\r\nA similar belief existed not very long ago in the south-westernmost\r\npart of England. Many readers will remember the scene\r\nin Sir Walter Scott's \"Pirate,\" in which Bryce, the pedlar,\r\nwarns the hero not to attempt to resuscitate an inanimate form,\r\nwhich the waves had washed ashore on the mainland of Shetland.\r\n\"Are you mad,\" exclaimed the pedlar, \"you that have\r\nlived sae lang in Zetland, to risk the saving of a drowning man?\r\nWot ye not if ye bring him to life again, he will do you some\r\ncapital injury?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barry, in his \"Ivan at Home\" (1872), gives a curious\r\ninstance of the Russian apathy and superstition in the case of\r\ndrowning men. A drunken man deliberately walked into the\r\nwater, and disappeared. A number of spectators stood by, but\r\nno one attempted a rescue, but gazed on the scene with the\r\nutmost indifference. A court of inquiry was held, and the\r\nclothes of the dead man were examined, but on looking at his\r\nneck, no cross was seen. This settled the question, and the\r\nverdict among the villagers was \"found drowned, because he\r\nhad no cross on his neck.\"\r\n\r\nAubrey, in his \"Miscellanies,\" alludes to the dream of\r\nSimonides, who saw a certain body thrown dead upon the shore,\r\nand though a stranger, he caused him to be buried. About\r\nthat time he was thinking of going on board a ship, but dreamed\r\nthat he had warning given him by the man whom he had had\r\ninterred, not to go; that if he did, the ship would infallibly be\r\ncast away. Upon this Simonides stayed back, and every person\r\non board the ship was afterwards drowned.[*]\r\n\r\n* In the narrative of the sufferings of Byron, and the crew of H.M. ship\r\nWager, on the coast of South America, occurs a curious illustration of the\r\nwide prevalency of those ideas which lie at the root of the word superstition.\r\n\"The reader will remember the shameful rioting, mutiny, and recklessness\r\nwhich disgraced the crew of the Wager, nor will he forget the\r\napproach to cannibalism and murder on one occasion. These men had\r\njust returned from a tempestuous navigation, in which their hopes of escape\r\nhad been crushed; and now what thoughts disturbed their rest--what\r\nserious consultations were they which engaged the attention of these sea-beaten\r\nmen? Long before Cheap's Bay had been left, the body of a man",
  "p0950.png": "\r\nIn the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" (February 8, 1767) is a\r\ncurious notice of the mode of discovering the dead body of a\r\ndrowned person: \"An inquisition was taken at Newbury,\r\nBerks, on the body of a child nearly two years old, who fell\r\ninto the river Kennet, and was drowned. The body was discovered\r\nby a very singular experiment. After diligent search\r\nhad been made in the river for the child, to no purpose, a two-*penny\r\nloaf, with a quantity of quicksilver put into it, was set\r\nfloating from the place where the child, it was supposed, had\r\nfallen in, which steered its course down the river upwards of\r\nhalf a mile, before a great number of spectators, when the body\r\nhappening to lay on the contrary side of the river, the loaf\r\nsuddenly tacked about, and swam across the river, and gradually\r\nsunk near the child, when both the child and the loaf were\r\nbrought up, with grabbers ready for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nSir James Alexander, in his \"Account of Canada\" (1849),\r\nsays: \"The Indians imagine that in the case of a drowned\r\nbody, its place may be discovered by floating a chip of cedar-*wood,\r\nwhich will stop and turn round over the exact spot; an\r\ninstance occurred within my own knowledge, in the case of Mr.\r\nLavery, of Kingston Mill, whose boat overset, and the person\r\nwas drowned near Cedar Island; nor could the body be discovered\r\nuntil this experiment was resorted to.\"\r\n\r\nWhat may be thought a superstition in such instances may\r\nbe, perhaps, referable to simple causes. As there are in all\r\nrunning streams, deep pools formed by eddies, in which\r\ndrowned bodies would be likely to be caught and retained,\r\n\r\nhad been found on a hill named \"Mount Misery.\" He was supposed to\r\nhave been murdered by some of the first gang who left the island. The\r\nbody had never been buried, and to such a neglect did the men now ascribe\r\nthe storms which had lately afflicted them; nor would they rest until the\r\nremains of their comrade were placed beneath the earth, when each evidently\r\nfelt as if some dreadful spell had been removed from his spirit. Few\r\nwould expect to find many points of resemblance between the Grecian\r\nmariners of the heroic ages, who navigated the galleys, described by Homer,\r\nto Troy, and the sailors of George II.; yet here, in these English seamen,\r\nwas the same feeling regarding the unburied dead which prevailed in\r\nancient times.\"",

The legend is very absurd, it seems that Morm, the\r\nfisherman, being at one time in want of fish-hooks, quietly killed\r\nhis two sons, and took their jawbones for hooks. As a requital\r\nto them for the loss of their lives, he made the right eye of his\r\nson the morning star, and the right eye of the youngest the\r\nevening star. One day he was sitting on a rock, fishing with\r\none of the jawbones, when he hooked something extraordinarily\r\nheavy--whales were nothing to him. However, this resisted all\r\nhis endeavours, and at length he was obliged to resort to other\r\nmeans to raise the monster. He caught a dove, and tying the\r\nline to its leg, he filled it with his spirit, and commanded it to\r\nfly upwards. It did so, and without the least difficulty New\r\nZealand came to light! Old Morm naturally looked on this\r\nprodigy with wonder; and thinking the land looked very\r\npretty, he stepped ashore, where he saw men and fire. The\r\nfirst thing he did was to burn his fingers, and in order to cool\r\nthem he jumped into the sea, when the sulphur which arose\r\nfrom him was so great, that the Sulphur Island was formed.\r\nAfter this, matters went on smoothly, until the New Zealanders\r\nbegan to grow refractory, and so offended the sun that his\r\nmajesty refused to shine. So old Morm got up one day very\r\nearly, and chased the sun; but it was not until after three days'\r\nhunting he managed to catch him. A good deal of parleying\r\nthen took place; at last, the sun consented to shine, but for\r\nhalf a day only. Old Morm, to remedy this evil, immediately\r\nmade the moon, and tied it by a rope to the sun, so that when\r\none went down the other rose up!\r\n\r\nFish superstitions prevail in New Zealand; prayers are ad-*",

When the whales spout and fish leap out of the water,\r\nthey are said to be doing their feats in honour of the god\r\nTangeroa. The first fish caught in the season was held tapu, or\r\nsacred; fishing expeditions and fishing-grounds were controlled\r\nby the priests.\r\n\r\nA Waikato story relates that a whale was stranded, containing\r\nthe spirit of the deified man, Tutunui. The animal was\r\nconsequently sacred. A man named Kae ate a portion of this\r\nwhale, which sacrilegious act was equivalent to eating the body\r\nof Tutunui. In revenge, the descendants of Tutunui killed and\r\nate Kae. Kae's friends in return ate one of Tutunui's descendants,\r\nand thus commenced cannibalism, and a cause was given\r\nfor its continuance.\r\n\r\nThere is a fable in New Zealand, which teaches us the best\r\npart of the eel and the cod-fish. \"Which is your best part?\"\r\nsaid the cod-fish to the eel. \"I am good,\" replied the eel,\r\n\"from my tail to my middle; but what is your good part?\" The\r\ncod-fish answered, \"My tail and my fins.\" Then the cod-fish\r\nasked the eel what was his fattest part, and he replied by looking\r\nat his tail and referring a similar question to the cod, who\r\nby opening his eyes signified that his head was the fattest part\r\nof his body.\r\n\r\nThe different families of the animal kingdom were derived,\r\naccording to the mythology of the New Zealanders, from some\r\nof those primitive denizens of the earth, who are fabled to have\r\npossessed superhuman qualities. Thus the eel and the conger-eel\r\nare said to have been the offspring of one of those ancient\r\nworthies named Maru-te-whareaitu. The lizard and the shark\r\nare said to have been brothers. The sea was their native\r\nelement; but wishing to separate after a quarrel, the former,\r\nwho was the elder, went to live on the land, while the latter\r\nremained in the sea. The lizard at parting thus cursed his\r\nbrother: \"Remain in the open sea, to be served up on a dish\r\nof cooked food for man to eat.\" \"As for you,\" replied the",

The former alludes to the custom of serving\r\nup a piece of dried shark on the top of a dish of potatoes for a\r\nrelish. The latter, to the mode of catching a lizard, by lighting\r\na fire at the entrance of his hole.\r\n\r\nA charm for a toothache is:\r\n\r\n\"An eel, a spiny back,\r\nTrue indeed, indeed: true in sooth, in sooth;\r\nYou must eat the head\r\nOf said spiny back.\"\r\n\r\nBELLS had a superstitious influence upon the minds of\r\nseamen. In former times, the bell which rang the people\r\nof St. Mouan's, in Scotland, to public worship, hung upon a\r\ntree in the churchyard, and was removed every year during the\r\nherring season, because the fishermen believed that the fish\r\nwere scared away from the coast by the noise.\r\n\r\nThe bell of the church of Ifvekofte, in Sweden, on that\r\nedifice being on fire, sank deep into a morass, where for many\r\nmonths it sounded at night, disturbing the villagers. It was\r\nevident that the bell was possessed by a demon, so two fishermen,\r\narmed with boathooks, set forth to the rescue. Scarcely\r\nhad they begun operations, than the bell began to expostulate.\r\n\"Ting, ting, ting,\" it went. \"Bother the bell!\" cried one of\r\nthe fishermen. \"We shall have it, if it be the wish of the holy\r\nVirgin and St Olaf,\" answered the other. The bell, silenced\r\nby these sacred names, gave, it is said, one last expiring note,\r\nsank deeper into the morass, and has held its clapper ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nSouthey's admirable ballad of the \"Inchcape Bell\" is founded\r\nupon a strange legend.

The chapel, though small,\r\nquite closes the pass between the rock-strewn cove and the\r\nhigh lands above, from which it is approached by a long and\r\nsteep flight of stone steps; in its open belfry hung a beautifully\r\nformed silver bell. Between it and the sea, and near high-water\r\nmark, is a well of pure water, often sought by sailors, who\r\nwere always received and attended to by the good saint.\r\n\r\nMany centuries ago, at the close of a calm summer's evening,\r\na boat entered the cove, urged by a crew with piratical intent,\r\nwho, regardless alike of the sanctity of the spot, and of the\r\nhospitality of its inhabitants, determined to possess themselves\r\nof the bell.

On no account\r\nwill the Ojibiways approach or land upon this island, supposing\r\nit to be the home of the Manitobah, \"the speaking god.\"\r\nThe cause of this curious sound is the beating of the waves on\r\nthe shingle, or large pebbles lining the shores. Along the\r\nnorthern coast of the island, there is a long low cliff of fine-grained\r\ncompact limestone, which under the stroke of the\r\nhammer clinks like steel. The waves, beating on the shore at\r\nthe foot of the cliff, cause the fallen fragments to rub against\r\neach other, and to give out a sound resembling the chimes of\r\ndistant church bells. This phenomenon occurs when the gales\r\nblow from the north, and then, as the winds subside, low,\r\nwailing sounds, like whispering voices, are heard in the air.\r\nTravellers assert that the effect is very impressive, and they\r\nhave been awakened at night under the impression that they\r\nwere listening to church bells.\r\n\r\n\"Bell-string Acre,\" at Burgh-in-the-Marsh, Lincolnshire,\r\ntakes its name from the circumstance of a sea-captain giving it\r\nto purchase a bell-rope of silk cord for the tenor bell, the sound\r\nof which, in a dark night, saved him from shipwreck.\r\n\r\n\"To this day,\" says Mr. Hunt, \"the tower of Forrabury\r\nChurch (Cornwall) remains without bells.

The captain laughed at the superstition, as he\r\ncalled it, and swore they had only to thank themselves for the\r\nspeedy voyage, and that, with his arm at the helm, and his\r\njudgment to guide them, they should soon have a happy\r\nlanding. The pilot checked the profane speech; but the\r\nwicked captain--and he swore more impiously than ever that\r\nall was due to himself and his men--laughed to scorn the\r\npilot's prayer. \"May God forgive you,\" was the pilot's reply.\r\n\r\nOn this popular Cornish legend, the late Reverend Mr.\r\nHawker wrote some fine stanzas, entitled, \"The Silent Tower\r\nof Bottreaux,\" which may not be familiar to some readers\r\n\r\n\"Tintagel bells ring o'er the tide,\r\nThe boy leans on the vessel's side,\r\nHe hears that sound, and dreams of home\r\nSoothe the wild orphan of the foam.\r\n'Come to thy God in time,'\r\nThus saith their pealing chime;\r\n'Youth, manhood, old age past,\r\nCome to thy God at last.'\r\n\r\n\"But why are Bottreaux's echoes still?\r\nHer tower stands proudly on the hill,\r\nYet the strange chough that home hath found,\r\nThe lamb lies sleeping on the ground.\r\n'Come to thy God in time,'\r\nShould be her answering chime;\r\n'Come to thy God at last,'\r\nShould echo on the blast.\r\n\r\n\"The ship rode down with courses free,\r\nThe daughter of a distant sea,",

He had the ringing of bells\r\nin his ears, which increased as consciousness was becoming\r\nless, and he felt as if 'all the bells of heaven were ringing him\r\ninto Paradise!'--the most soothing sensations. I know the\r\nlocality where the circumstance occurred, and there is no bell\r\nwithin a circuit of six miles, but one old cracked church bell.\"\r\n\r\nWhen ships go down at sea during a terrible tempest, it is\r\nsaid that the death-bell is distinctly heard amidst the storm-*wind.\r\nSir Walter Scott probably alludes to the superstition in\r\nthe lines--\r\n\r\n\"And the Kelpie rang,\r\nAnd the sea-maid sang,\r\nThe dirge of lovely Rosabelle.\"\r\n\r\nDuring storms at Malta, it is the custom for all the bells in\r\nthe Roman Catholic churches to be rung for an hour, that the\r\nwinds may cease and the sea be calmed. This custom also\r\nprevails in Sicily and Sardinia, in Tuscany and in France.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Golden Legend\" we read: \"It is said that evil\r\nspirytes that ben in the region of th' ayre, donte moche when\r\nthey here the belles ringen when it thondreth, and when grete\r\ntempeste and rages of wether happen, to the end that the\r\nfeinds and wycked spirytes should be abashed and flee, and\r\ncease of the movynge of tempeste.\"\r\n\r\nBacon says \"that the sound of bells will disperse lightning\r\nand thunder; in winds,\" he adds, \"it has not been observed.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a bell-legend connected with Jersey: Many\r\nyears ago the twelve parish churches in that island possessed\r\neach a valuable peal of bells; but during a long civil war the\r\nStates determined on selling these bells to defray the expenses\r\nof the troops. The bells were accordingly collected and sent\r\nto France for that purpose; but on the passage, the ship foundered,\r\nand everything was lost, to show the wrath of heaven\r\nat such a sacrilege. Since then, during a storm, these bells",
  "p1050.png": "always ring from the deep; and to this day the fishermen of\r\nSt. Ouen's Bay always go to the edge of the water before\r\nembarking, to listen if they can hear the bells upon the wind;\r\nand, if so, nothing will induce them to leave the shore--if all\r\nis quiet, they fearlessly set sail. This, like many other stories\r\nof the same character, is based upon a loose tradition; and\r\nfrom some experience of the Jersey fishermen, we can pronounce\r\nthem a thorough matter-of-fact people.\r\n\r\nIt is related of Pol de L\u00e9on, the famous saint of Brittany\r\n(born about a.d. 490), that a Count de Guythure, who was\r\ngovernor of Batz, hearing that he had arrived there from\r\nEngland (walking over the sea one fine afternoon), told him he\r\nwas much disturbed on account of a little silver bell, belonging\r\nto a king of England, the possession of which he coveted exceedingly.\r\nSt. Pol ordered a fish to swallow the bell, and bring it\r\nover, which was instantly performed: but the saint had provided\r\na rival to himself: for the bell became a no less celebrated\r\nadept in miracles than he was; and between them both,\r\nthe want of physicians in the country was entirely precluded.\r\nThe bell was afterwards deposited among the treasures of the\r\nCathedral of St. Pol de L\u00e9on.\r\n\r\nLEGENDS of the miraculous restoration of rings, etc., by\r\nfishes are to be found in most countries. In the arms\r\nof the city of Glasgow is a salmon holding a gold ring in his\r\nmouth, forming a conspicuous figure in the armorial bearings\r\nof the church at Glasgow. Archbishop Spottiswoode relates,\r\nthe following tradition in explanation: \"In the days of St.\r\nKentigern, or St. Mungo, the founder of the see of Glasgow,\r\na lady having lost her wedding-ring, her husband's jealousy was\r\nstirred, to allay which she applied to St. Kentigern, imploring\r\nhis help for the sake of her honour. Not long after, as the\r\nsaint walked by the river, he desired a person who was fishing\r\nto bring him the first fish he could get, and from its mouth\r\nwas taken the lady's ring, which he immediately sent to her to\r\nquiet her husband's suspicions.",
  "p1060.png": "\r\nReginald of Durham tells us that a school was kept in the\r\nChurch of Norham-on-the-Tweed, the parish priest being the\r\nteacher. One of the boys, named Aldine, had incurred the\r\nsentence of correction, to escape which he took the key of the\r\nchurch-door, which appears to have been in his custody, and\r\nthrew it into a deep pool in the River Tweed, now called\r\nPedwel, or Peddle, a place well known as a fishing-station.\r\nHe hoped by such means to escape scholastic discipline.\r\nAccordingly, when the hour of vespers came, and the priest\r\narrived, the key of the door was missing, and the boy declared\r\nhe did not know where it was. The lock was too strong and\r\nponderous to be forced or broken; and after a vain effort to\r\nopen the door, the evening was allowed to pass without divine\r\nservice. The story goes on to say that, in the night, St. Cuthbert\r\nappeared to the priest and inquired wherefore he had\r\nneglected his service. On hearing the explanation, the saint\r\nordered him to go the next morning to the fishing-station and\r\nbuy the first net of fish that was drawn out of the river. The\r\npriest obeyed; and in the net was a salmon of extraordinary\r\nmagnitude, in the throat of which was found the lost key of\r\nNorham Church.\r\n\r\nIn the German Church at Rome (La Maria dell' Anima), there\r\nis an altarpiece, by Carlo Saraceni, representing St. Benno,\r\nand the miraculous recovery of a key. The legend runs thus:\r\nSt. Benno, a German Benedictine, was Bishop of Meissen, in\r\nSaxony, in the time of the Emperor Henry IV. After the excommunication\r\nof this monarch, in 1075, he attempted to make\r\na forcible entry into the cathedral of Meissen. Benno closed the\r\ndoors against him, flung the key into the Elbe, and retired to\r\nRome. On his return to his bishopric, he recovered the key\r\nby a miracle; for he ordered a fisherman to cast his net into\r\nthe river, and, a fish being caught, the key was found in it.\r\n\r\nIt is related of St. Francis Xavier that when on his voyage to\r\nIndia he was preaching to the sailors and passengers, his crucifix\r\nfell into the sea, and was miraculously restored at his earnest\r\nprayer, for a crayfish, or lobster, appeared on the surface of the\r\nwaters bearing the crucifix in its claws.",
  "p1070.png": "\r\nIn the Talmud, a story is recorded to show how the observance\r\nof the Sabbath is rewarded: One Joseph, a Jew, who\r\nhonoured the Sabbath, had a very rich neighbour, who was a\r\nfirm believer in astrology. He was told by one of the professional\r\nastrologers that his wealth would become Joseph's. He\r\ntherefore sold his estate, and bought with the proceeds a large\r\ndiamond, which he sewed in his turban, saying, \"Joseph can\r\nnever obtain this.\" It so happened, however, that, when\r\nstanding one day on the deck of a ship in which he was crossing\r\nthe sea, a heavy wind arose and carried the turban off his\r\nhead. A fish swallowed the diamond; and being caught and\r\nexposed for sale in the market, was purchased by Joseph to\r\nsupply his table on the Sabbath eve. Of course, upon opening\r\nit, he discovered the diamond.\r\n\r\nPARTICULAR Seasons of the Year, and Saints' Days were\r\nheld in superstitious veneration among mariners, and\r\npeculiar customs were attached to them. The old practice of\r\nsetting the nets at Christmas Eve was generally observed\r\nthroughout Sweden. Abraham Brahe notes in his \"Tankebuk\"\r\n(Dec. 24, 1618): \"On this Christmas Eve, God\r\ngranted me a glorious haul of fish.\" At Ofved's Kloster, in\r\nSweden, it was the practice of the peasants every Christmas Eve\r\nto go by torchlight and fish for their Christmas supper, first\r\ninvoking the aid of the demon who dwelt at the bottom of the\r\nlake. All-Hallow Even, or the vigil of All Saints' Day, was\r\nreligiously kept by mariners. At this period, the fishermen of\r\nOrkney sprinkled what was called fore-spoken water over their\r\nboats, when they had not been successful. They also made the\r\nsign of the cross on their boats with tar.\r\n\r\nAll Saints' Day was observed by the Norman fishermen\r\n(especially at Dieppe) with great solemnity, even to a late\r\nperiod. Seamen who ventured out to sea on this anniversary\r\nwere said to have the \"double sight\"--that is, each one beheld\r\na living likeness of himself, seated in close contact, or when\r\nengaged in any work, doing the same. If the nets were cast",
  "p1080.png": "out, they were found, on drawing them in, to contain nothing\r\nbut bones, portions of skeletons, or fragments of winding-sheets.\r\n\r\nA curious custom respecting May Day is noticed by Martin,\r\nin his \"Account of the Western Isles of Scotland\" (1716). He\r\nsays that the fishermen of the village of Barvas (isle of St.\r\nLewis) have the habit of sending a man very early on May\r\nDay to Barvas river, in order that any females may be prevented\r\nfrom crossing it first; for if such happened, it would\r\nhinder the salmon from coming into the river all the year\r\nround.\r\n\r\nAmong the Finns, any fisherman who created a disturbance\r\non St. George's Day was in danger of encountering storms\r\nand tempests. The fishermen who dwell on the coasts of the\r\nBaltic never used their nets between All Saints' Day and St.\r\nMartin's Day. They believed that any infraction of this rule\r\nwould prevent them from getting fish through the whole year.\r\nThey will not fish on St. Blaise's Day.\r\n\r\nSneezing on Christmas Day is considered a favourable omen\r\nby the seamen in those parts.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of Hartlepool are a peculiar race, intermarrying\r\nand remaining stationary. They preserve many old customs,\r\nsuch as Carling and Palm Sundays, and Easter Day. If a\r\nchild is brought to visit a neighbour for the first time, it is presented\r\nwith salt, bread, and an egg. A similar custom to this\r\nprevails at Hull. On Easter Monday, the Hartlepool youths\r\nsteal the women's shoes, and the women retaliate; fines are\r\nlevied for the restoration of the theft, and spent in merry-making.\r\nMell-suppers are usual at harvest-home; fried peas\r\nare eaten on Carling Sunday, and coloured eggs are given at\r\nEaster. At Christmas the children sing carols, and sword-*dancers\r\ngo about.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter's Day, June 25, was consecrated to several curious\r\nobservances by mariners. In an old account of the Lordship\r\nof Gaisborough, in Cleveland, Yorkshire, it is stated, \"that the\r\nfishermen on St. Peter's Daye invited their friends and kinsfolk",
  "p1090.png": "to a festyvall, kept after their fashion with a free hearte, and no\r\nshow of niggardnesse. That day their boats are dressed\r\ncuriously for the showe; their mastes are painted, and certaine\r\nrytes observed amongst them with sprinklyng their bowes with\r\ngood liquor, sold with them at a groate a quarte, which custome\r\nor superstition, sucked from their auncestors, even continyeth\r\ndowne unto this present tyme.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Peter is represented by Cortez, in his \"Voyages,\" as\r\nbeing the sailors' patron; \"and beying at sea, Cortez willed all\r\nhis navie to have St. Peter for their patrone, warning them all-*wayes\r\nto follow the 'Admirall' wherein he went, bycause he\r\ncarried light for the night season to guide them the way.\"\r\n\r\nCERTAIN days of the week were regarded with superstitious\r\nfancies. Friday, so dark-lined to many weak-headed individuals,\r\nnot only at sea, but on land, was, and is still, considered[**typo fixed ]\r\nby some mariners a blank day for sailing. The\r\nWellesley, bearing the flag of the Earl of Dundonald, on\r\nleaving Plymouth for the West Indies, got under weigh on\r\nFriday, March 24, 1848, and after she had got outside the\r\nBreakwater, she was recalled by the Port Admiral, and did not\r\nleave again until the following day. The object of this delay\r\nwas to send the mail-bags, but the ship's crew firmly believed\r\nthat the gallant admiral left something behind, purposely, to\r\navoid going to sea on a Friday.\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Notes and Queries\" mentions that one of the\r\nassistants at the bathing-machines, at Scarborough, informed\r\nhim that most accidents happened on Fridays, especially on\r\nGood Fridays. He had never worked on Good Friday for\r\nmany years, nor would he ever do so again. He then gave a\r\nlong series of misfortunes, fatal accidents, etc., which had happened\r\non Fridays in his own experience.\r\n\r\nMany a good ship has (observes Southey) lost that tide which\r\nmight have led to fortune, because the captain and the crew\r\nthought it unlucky to begin their voyage on a Friday. You\r\nwere in no danger of being left behind on that day, however",
  "p1100.png": "favourable the wind, if it were possible for the captain to devise\r\nany excuse for remaining till the morrow in harbour.\r\n\r\nSaturday was considered inauspicious to seamen. In Archbishop\r\nHamiltown's \"Catechisme\" (1551), we find, \"certayne\r\ncraftesmen will nocht begin their worke on Satterday; certayne\r\nschipmen, or marinars, will not begin to sail on the Satterday\r\n... quhilk is plane superstition.\"\r\n\r\nSaturday, however, was not always considered unfortunate.\r\nJoinville, in his \"Memoirs,\" relates in a journey to the Holy\r\nLand, the approach of his vessel to \"a great high mountain,\r\nwhich we met about vespers, off Barbary. When we had passed\r\nit, we made all the sail we could during the night, and in the\r\nmorning we supposed we must have run fifty leagues or more;\r\nbut we found ourselves again off this large mountain. We were,\r\nof course, much alarmed, and continued to make all the sail we\r\ncould that day and the following night; but it was all the\r\nsame, we still had the mountain. We were more astonished\r\nthan ever, and thought we ran great risks of our lives, for the\r\nsailors told us that the Saracens of Barbary would come and\r\nattack us. A very discreet churchman called the Dean of\r\nMauru, came forward and said: 'Gentlemen, I never remember\r\nany distress in our parish, either from too much\r\nabundance, or for want of rain, or any other plague, but that\r\nGod and His mother delivered us from it, when a procession\r\nhad been made three times on a Saturday.' Now this day was\r\nSaturday, and we instantly began a procession round the masts\r\nof the ship. Immediately afterwards, we lost sight of this\r\nmountain.\"\r\n\r\nThe first Monday in April, the day on which Cain was born\r\nand Abel was slain; the second Monday in August, on which\r\nSodom and Gomorrah were destroyed; December 31, on which\r\nday Judas was born, who betrayed Jesus Christ--these were\r\naccounted evil days by seamen. A Cornish saying places\r\nCandlemas Day as ill-omened for sailing. Bishop Hall, alluding\r\nto a superstitious man, observes: \"He will never set to sea\r\nexcept on Sunday.\" At Prestonpans, it was the usual custom",
  "p1110.png": "to sail on that day for the fishing grounds. A clergyman of the\r\ntown preached against this Sabbath-breaking, and the fishermen,\r\nto prevent any ill befalling them in consequence, made a small\r\nfigure of rags, and burnt it on the top of their chimneys!\r\n\r\nIn \"Dives and Lazarus\" (1493), among the superstitions then\r\nprevalent at the beginning of the year, the author says: \"Alle\r\nthat tak hede to dismayle dayes, or use nice observaunces in\r\nthe newe moone, or in the newe yere, as settyng of mete and\r\ndrinke by night on the beache to feed Allhelde, or gobelyn.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Orkneys, the fishermen put the black cross to many\r\ndays in the year, in which they would neither go to sea, or perform\r\nany sort of work at home--an agreeable belief to those\r\nwho preferred indolence to activity.\r\n\r\nONE of the superstitions that still clings to seafaring life, is\r\nthe confidence in the virtues of a Child's Caul, as a preservative\r\nagainst drowning. The caul is a thin membrane found\r\nencompassing the head of some children when born, and it\r\nwas considered a good omen for the child itself, and productive\r\nof good fortune, and escape from danger to the purchaser.\r\nThere are frequent allusions to its occult virtues by the old\r\nwriters; thus in Ben Jonson's \"Alchemist\" (Act i., sc. 2), we\r\nhave Face saying to Dapper:\r\n\r\n\"Ye were born with a Cawl o' your head.\"\r\n\r\nIn Digby's \"Elvira\" (Act v.), Don Sancho says:\r\n\r\n\"Were we not born with cauls upon our heads?\r\nThink'st thou, chicken, to come off twice arow\r\nThus rarely from such dangerous adventures?\"\r\n\r\nThe presumed power of the caul to prevent shipwrecks, and\r\nsave from drowning, was a strong belief in those who crossed\r\nthe watery element. Frequent inquiries for cauls in the newspapers\r\nprove the value attached to them. Fifteen, twenty, and\r\nthirty guineas have been asked by sellers, and probably found\r\nready purchasers. In the Western Daily News of Plymouth\r\n(February 9, 1867), is a notice to mariners offering, as a safe-*",
  "p1120.png": "*guard at sea, a child's caul for five guineas. The Times (May\r\n8, 1848) has an offer to sell one for six guineas. It is described\r\nas \"having been afloat with its last owner forty years, through all\r\nthe perils of a seaman's life, and the owner died at last in his\r\nbed, at the place of his birth.\" In the Liverpool Mercury\r\n(1873), three of these membranes were advertised for sale at\r\none time, varying in price from thirty shillings to two guineas.\r\n\r\nGreat stress is laid by the votaries of the caul superstition on\r\nthe soundness of the article; thus in the Times (February 27,\r\n1813) we find, \"A child's caul in a perfect state for sale.\"\r\n\r\nThe same notion respecting a child's caul to prevent drowning,\r\nprevailed in France as in England. It is alluded to in a\r\nrondeau by Claude de Malleville (born 1597).\r\n\r\nThe superstition respecting the caul is from remote antiquity,\r\nand was prevalent in the days of the Roman empire. \u00c6lius\r\nLampridius in his life of Antonine, surnamed Diadumeninus,\r\nsays that he was so called from having been brought into the\r\nworld with a band of membrane round his forehead, in the\r\nshape of a diadem, and that he enjoyed a perpetual state of\r\nfelicity from this circumstance during the whole of his life and\r\nreign. The Pagan midwives, however, made no scruple of\r\nselling the caul, and their best market was the Forum, where\r\nthey got high prices for it from the lawyers. Many of the\r\ncouncils of the early Christian Church denounced the superstition,\r\nwhether had recourse to by buyer or seller, for a good\r\nequally as for a bad purpose. St. John Chrysostom frequently\r\ninveighed against it in his homilies.\r\n\r\n\"Il est n\u00e9 coiff\u00e9,\" is a well-known French expression, describing\r\na lucky man, and indicating that he was born with a caul.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that so long as the child from whom the caul\r\nhad been taken enjoyed good health, the caul experienced the\r\nsame, and was dry, flexible, and healthy; but on the caul-born\r\nperson suffering from any sickness, or decline of health, the\r\nmembrane also underwent a change, which became daily more\r\napparent, either becoming totally crisp, or regaining its former\r\nflexibility, according as the person either died or recovered.",
  "p1130.png": "Often these cauls became hereditary, being handed down from\r\nfather to son (especially if it was born in the family), and were\r\nregarded by their respective owners with as much superstition\r\nas if the caul-born person was still living.[*]\r\n\r\nThe witchcraft of the middle ages declared against the caul\r\nretaining any virtue whatever, if parted with by sale, or even\r\nby gift to any but a member of the child's kindred. Midwives,\r\nhowever, began at length to discountenance this exclusive view\r\nof the matter, and by degrees availed themselves of their privilege\r\nof purloining the magic membrane, without letting either\r\nparent know of its existence, and disposing of it to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nLevinus Lemnius, in his \"Occult Miracles of Nature,\" says\r\nthat if the caul be of a blackish colour, it is an omen of ill-fortune\r\nto the child; but if of a reddish one it betokens everything\r\nthat is good. Strange to say the efficacy of a child's caul\r\nfinds believers in Burmah, only instead of preserving the wearer\r\nfrom drowning, it is supposed to assist in gaining the goodwill\r\nof any person he addresses in order to ask a favour. The child\r\nborn with a caul is deemed to be fortunate in after life.\r\n\r\nWeston, in his \"Moral Aphorisms from the Arabic\" (1801),\r\nsays that the superstition of the caul comes from the East.\r\nThere are several words in Arabic for it.\r\n\r\nFISHERMEN generally have a strong notion of retributive\r\npunishment. At Tenby, in Pembrokeshire, there is a\r\ntradition of some extraordinary bank or rock, at sea, called\r\n\r\n* The will of Sir John Offley, Knight, of Madeley Manor, Staffordshire,\r\n(grandson of Sir Thomas Offley, Lord Mayor of London, temp. Elizabeth,)\r\nproved at Doctor's Commons, May 20th, 1658, contains the following\r\nsingular bequest: \"Item, I will and devise one Jewell, done all in Gold\r\nand enamelled; wherein there is a caul that covered my face and shoulders,\r\nwhen I came into the world, the use thereof to my loving Daughter, the Lady\r\nElizabeth Jenny, so long as she shall live; and after her decease the use likewise\r\nthereof to her son, Offley Jenny, during his natural life; and after his\r\ndecease, to my own right heirs male for ever; and so, from heir to heir,\r\nto be left so long as it shall please God of His Goodness to continue any Heir\r\nMale of my name, desiring that the same Jewell be not concealed nor sold by\r\nany of them.'[**P3 \"?]",
  "p1140.png": "Will's Mark, on which cod-fish in great abundance were formerly\r\ntaken. This spot is no longer to be found, and the loss is said\r\nto have been occasioned as a judgment for some enormity, formerly\r\ncommitted by the inhabitants of Tenby. In 1858, a\r\nreport was spread that the submerged bank had been found,\r\nprobably because the people of Tenby had (unconsciously, of\r\ncourse) done some good act of expiation.\r\n\r\nRats leaving a ship are considered indicative of misfortune\r\nto a vessel, probably from the same idea that crows will not\r\nbuild upon trees that are likely to fall. A story is told of a\r\ncunning Welsh captain who wanted, however, to get rid of rats\r\nthat infested his ship, then lying in the Mersey, at Liverpool.\r\nHe found out that there was a vessel laden with cheese in the\r\nbasin, and getting alongside of her about dusk, he left all\r\nhatches open, and waited till all the rats were in his neighbour's\r\nship, and then moved off.\r\n\r\nTo cut the nails or hair during a calm was thought likely to\r\nprovoke fierce winds. Hesiod recommends that nails should\r\nnot be pared when we are in the presence of the gods. Petronius\r\nArbiter says that nails and hair should only be cut in a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nThe dim form of the full moon seen with the new moon was\r\nconsidered an evil sign by the sailors of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies:\r\n\r\n\"I saw the new moon late yestreen\r\nWith the old moon in her arm,\r\nAnd if we go to sea, master,\r\nI fear we'll come to harm.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the moon in the first or last quarter lies in nearly a\r\nhorizontal position, or \"flat on her back\" as sailors say, with\r\nher horns upwards, it is considered a sign of fine weather, as\r\n\"you may hang your hat upon them.\"\r\n\r\nA horseshoe nailed to the mast was thought by sailors not\r\nonly a security against the Evil One (as folks do at present in\r\nour rural districts), but a specific against many dangers. As",
  "p1150.png": "such it is a recognised custom among the fishermen of New\r\nfoundland.[** ? Newfoundland]\r\n\r\nIf a cat plays with a gown or apron, it is the sign of a gale.\r\nThere are persons who pretend to have seen the sea-dog\r\n\"Shock,\" who comes out of the sea and roams over the hills\r\nwhen a storm is brooding.\r\n\r\nIn Scarborough Folk-lore, it is noted by a visitor to that district\r\nthat the Filey fishermen will not go to sea on any day\r\nwhen they have either seen or met a pig the first thing in the\r\nmorning. Those who steer the pleasure-boats, will not allow\r\npassengers to whistle; a reason for this is given by an old\r\nsailor: \"We only whistle while the wind is asleep, and then the\r\nbreeze comes.\" No sailor will set out on a voyage if he finds\r\nhis earthenware basin turned upside down in the morning, when\r\nhe is about to have breakfast; the boys sometimes turn their\r\nbasins upside down purposely, when they wish to have a day's\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nGOOD-LUCK is as much the creed of the fisherman as it is\r\nof many superstitious persons on land. In a number of\r\nthe Banff Journal a few years ago, we read that the herring\r\nfishery having been very backward, some fishermen of Buckie\r\ndressed a cooper in a flannel shirt, with burs stuck all over it,\r\nand in this condition he was carried in procession through the\r\ntown in a hand-barrow. This was done to bring better \"luck\"\r\nto the fishing. It happened in a district where there are no\r\nless than nine churches and chapels of various denominations,\r\nand thirteen schools! After this we need not sneer at the\r\nmodern Greek fishermen for their libations to the sea, and\r\ninvocations to the saints for \"good-luck.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the fishermen of Greenock there was a strange idea\r\nthat if a fly fell into a glass from which anyone had been\r\ndrinking, or was about to drink, it was considered a sure and\r\ntrue omen of \"good-luck\" to the drinker, and was always\r\nnoticed as such by the company.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of the Firth of Forth believed that if they",
  "p1160.png": "chanced to meet a woman bare-footed, who had broad feet and\r\nflattish great toes, when they were proceeding to go to sea in\r\ntheir boats, they would have \"bad-luck,\" and, consequently,\r\nneed not go out in search of fish. It was also considered\r\n\"unlucky\" to sell fish for the first time in the day to a person\r\nhaving broad thumbs.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish anglers say that if a woman strides the rod, no\r\ntrout will be caught that day. It is strange to find Holinshed,\r\nin the Scottish Chronicle, relating a similar superstition. He\r\nsays: \"Over against Rosse, in an ile named Lewis, sixtie miles\r\nin length, there is but one fresh river, and it is said that if a\r\nwoman wade through the same, there shall be no samon seene\r\nthere for a twelvemonth afterwards; whereas, otherwise, that\r\nfish is known to abound there in verie greate plentie.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Orkneys, mariners believed that \"good-luck\" depended\r\non their turning the boat in opposition to the sun's course. In\r\nSweden it is considered \"unlucky\" to turn the prow of a boat\r\ntowards the shore. The Swedish fishermen believe that anyone\r\nsaying \"good-luck\" to them when starting, was ominous;\r\nalso, that pins found in a church, and made into hooks, would\r\nbring \"good-luck.\" Tackle, they say, stolen from a friend, or\r\na neighbour, would bring better luck than that bought with\r\nmoney; a species of larceny more profitable to the fisherman\r\nthan beneficial to his friends.\r\n\r\nCarew, in his \"Survey of Cornwall,\" mentions as a species\r\nof \"ill-luck,\" that \"to talk of hares, or such uncouth things,\r\nproves as ominous to a fisherman as the beginning of a voyage\r\nto a mariner on Candlemas Day.\" By the way, the Cornish\r\nfishermen have a superstition that a white hare frequenting the\r\nquays at night, predicts a storm. In Forfarshire there are\r\nfishermen, who, on a hare crossing their path, while on their\r\nway to their boats, will not put to sea.\r\n\r\nA dead hare on board a ship was, formerly, considered a sure\r\nsign of a tempest.\r\n\r\nSneezing, a potent omen in ancient days, had its portent for\r\ngood or bad luck among the seamen in olden times; a sneeze",
  "p1170.png": "on the left side at the moment of embarking was too ominous\r\nof \"ill-luck\" to be disregarded; while a fortunate sneeze on\r\nthe right side, betokened a favourable voyage.\r\n\r\nOn the highest mound of the hill above Weston-super-Mare,\r\nis a heap of stones, to which every fisherman on his daily walk\r\nto Sand Bay, Newstoke, contributes one for \"luck's\" sake.\r\n\r\nIt is considered \"unlucky\" to lose a water-bucket, or a mop\r\nat sea. Children on board-ship are always regarded by Jack as\r\nlikely to bring \"good-luck;\" not so a cat, which is always sure\r\nto turn the scale of chance in the wrong direction; probably\r\nbecause the Evil One was supposed to assume that disguise.\r\nWhittington, however, the renowned thrice Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon, could not possibly have shared in this superstition.\r\n\r\nTo play at cards on board was considered \"unlucky\" by\r\nseamen, and in this we can readily concur, without the fear of\r\nraising the spirit of the storm. In the campaigns of the French\r\nfleet at Mitylene, the crew of a brigantine are said to have seen\r\nthe Evil One in the frightful and hideous figure of a gigantic\r\nsailor descend into the waters at Zante, with a seaman of profligate\r\nhabits, who while playing at dice on board, and defying\r\nthe Virgin, was carried off.\r\n\r\nAt Redcar, in Yorkshire, it was customary every year to\r\nchange a boat's crew for \"luck's\" sake.\r\n\r\nThe unusual appearance of a whale in the Thames in 1658\r\nwas considered a prognostic of \"ill-luck\" to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe departure of a Chinese vessel from port takes place on a\r\n\"lucky\" day, selected by Taonish priests, or, in their absence,\r\nby astrologers. The day generally selected is either the first\r\nor the fifteenth of each lunar month, at the new or full\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nFishermen, while standing or walking, consider it \"unlucky\"\r\nto be numbered. It is equally so if they are asked on their way\r\nto the boats where they are going.\r\n\r\nA flat foot in the sand is considered unlucky; also to go in\r\nan open boat after an accident has occurred, and some person\r\nhas been drowned.",
  "p1180.png": "\r\nA correspondent of \"Notes and Queries\" remarks that\r\n\"wife-beating to the effusion of blood may be a novel method\r\nof securing luck in the herring-fishing, but to 'draw blood' is\r\npractised in some of the fishing villages on the north-east coast\r\nof Scotland, under the belief that success follows the act. This\r\nact must be performed on New Year's Day, and the good\r\nfortune is his only who is the first to shed blood. If the morning\r\nof the New Year is such as to allow the boats of the village\r\nto put to sea, there is quite a struggle which boat will reach the\r\nfishing-ground first, so as to gain the coveted prize--the first\r\nshed blood of the year. If the weather is unfavourable for\r\nfishing, those who are in possession of guns--and a great many\r\nof the fishermen's houses possess one--are out, gun in hand,\r\nalong the shore before daybreak, in search of some bird or wild\r\nanimal, no matter how small, that they may draw blood, and\r\nthus make sure of one year's good fortune.\"\r\n\r\nAn editorial note refers the reader to the \"Lady of the\r\nLake\" for a prophecy in connection with this subject:\r\n\r\n\"Which spills the foremost foeman's life,\r\nThat party conquers in the strife.\"\r\n\r\nTHE superstitious idea of the \"divinity that hedges in a\r\nking,\" and made C\u00e6sar encourage his alarmed boatman:\r\n\"Fear nothing; you carry C\u00e6sar, and the fortune of\r\nC\u00e6sar, in your boat,\"[*] is related of Rufus. In 1099, while\r\nhunting, a messenger from Normandy brought word that the\r\ncity of Mans was besieged. Without dismounting from his\r\nhorse, he hastened to the nearest seaport, and on being\r\nreminded that it was necessary to collect troops, he said: \"I\r\nshall see who will follow me, and if I understand the youth of\r\nthis kingdom, I shall have people enough.\" Although it was\r\nalmost a storm, and the wind contrary, he insisted upon em-*\r\n\r\n* The address of C\u00e6sar to his pilot, \"Quid metuas? C\u00e6sarem vehis,\"\r\nwas inscribed on one of the medals of William III. The king, indeed,\r\ndid not use the same words to his attendants in the tempest-tossed skiff\r\nnear Holland, but seeeing[**seeing] them exhausted with fatigue, and terrified with\r\nthe danger, he said: \"How! should you think it hard to die with Me?\"",

Perceiving some alarm in\r\nthe countenances of the crew at the stormy state of the weather,\r\nhe is reported to have uttered these remarkable words: \"If the\r\nSupreme Ruler designs by my arrival in England to restore to\r\nmy people that peace which He knows I have sincerely at\r\nheart, may He mercifully bring me to a safe port; but if His\r\nwill be decreed to scourge the realm, may I never be permitted\r\nto reach its shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe immunity of an anointed king has its influence on the\r\nstrong-minded German Emperor, Wilhelm I. A few summers\r\npast, a young married couple, sojourning somewhere on the\r\nbanks of the Lake of Constance, visited the island of Meinau,\r\nwhere the emperor was residing with his son-in-law, the Grand\r\nDuke of Baden. On their departure, so furious a storm came\r\non that their boatman found it impossible to proceed, and they\r\nwere forced, after much buffeting from the waves, to return to\r\nthe island. The emperor seeing their plight, met them on the\r\nbeach, and ordering steam to be got up in his little iron steamer,\r\nplaced it at their service. The lady, alarmed at her first\r\nencounter with the waves, demurred somewhat to trusting herself\r\nagain to their mercies. \"Do not be alarmed,\" said the\r\nemperor, \"the steamer bears my name, and that ought to\r\nre-assure you.\"",
  "p1200.png": "\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMINERS.\r\n\r\nFROM the earliest times serpents and demons were supposed\r\nto guard the mines from intrusion. In an illustration of\r\nFerguson's fine work on the culte of the tree and the serpent,\r\nare seen the aborigines of India, the Turanians, constantly\r\nguarded and followed by serpents, represented as darting from\r\ntheir shoulders, and who make a dais on the head. Thus seen,\r\nthey appeared to be occupied in working metals. They serve\r\nas hammers, which, by virtue of their form, are evidently of\r\nstone. The stone hammer is an emblem of power; the sceptre\r\nof many of the gods of the aborigines, and especially of those\r\nwho presided over metallurgy. Such are Indra, to the Indians\r\nfamous as the giver of riches, whose throne is in the golden\r\nmountain of Meroe; Hephestus and Vulcan, gods of Greece\r\nand Rome; and the Scandinavian Thor, one of the oldest of\r\nthe gods, since he had the earth for his mother, and his father\r\nOdin had the power to change himself into a serpent. The\r\ndiscovery of these stone hammers, thus connected with the first\r\nmetallurgic gods, in the copper mines of Anglesea, and in Peru,\r\nis a significant fact, and the legends relative to serpents, or the\r\ngod-serpents, who interfere in the working of metals, are too\r\nnumerous and significative to escape observation. The serpents\r\nof India, regarded as demigods, are famous in tradition for\r\ntheir skill in working metals, especially gold. The grand\r\nserpent of Egypt, Kneph, is the father of Hephestus, god of",
  "p1210.png": "metals; and Hi, or Hoa, the serpent-god of Chaldea, master of\r\nall wisdom, is also the guardian of treasures.\r\n\r\nThe god-serpent of Greece, Cadmus, was regarded as the\r\nfirst miner, and he was, according to Pliny, the first workman\r\nin gold.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs entertain much the same superstitious fears with\r\nregard to mines that the ancients did, with the slight difference\r\nthat mythological belief established M. Caillaud, in his exploration\r\nof Mount Zubara, in Egypt, was cautioned against\r\nsleeping over the caves, as they were the refuge of snakes,\r\nwolves, and other beasts of prey; and the abode of demons,\r\nwho would resent the intrusion.\r\n\r\nThe belief that evil spirits guard the treasures in emerald\r\nmines is as strong at the present day, among the Peruvian\r\nIndians, as it was in the time of Pliny with regard to the\r\nScythian mines.\r\n\r\nStevenson, alluding to the emerald mine in the neighbourhood\r\nof \"Los Esmeraldos,\" states: \"I never visited it, owing\r\nto the superstitious dread of the natives, who assured me it was\r\nenchanted, and guarded by a dragon, which poured forth\r\nthunder and lightning on those who dared to ascend the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nAn ancient lead and silver mine, between Villa Cidro and\r\nVill' Ermosa, in Sardinia, has been neglected and allowed to\r\nfill with water, from a dread, handed down from tradition, of\r\nthe solifuga, a small, venomous spider, so named from its\r\navoiding the sun, and haunting the darkest recesses of the\r\nmine, whose bite was considered to be mortal.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of the \"solifuga\" belongs to a very remote\r\nperiod, for Agricola mentions certain little animals resembling\r\nspiders, which he calls \"lucifega,\" and which haunted chiefly\r\nthe silver mines.\r\n\r\nIn the Ceylon Times of a recent date, is the relation of a\r\nhorrible superstition among the Tamul population employed as\r\nlabourers on a coffee estate: \"It is the belief of all Orientals\r\nthat hidden treasures are under the guardianship of supernatural",
  "p1220.png": "beings. The Singhalese, however, divide the charge between\r\ndemons and cobra da capellos. Various charms are resorted to\r\nby those who wish to gain the treasures. A pooja is sufficient\r\nwith the cobras, but the demons require a sacrifice. Blood of\r\na human being is the most important, but as far as it is known\r\nthe Cappowas have hitherto confined themselves to a sacrifice\r\nof a white cock, combining its blood with their own, drawn by\r\na slight puncture in the hand or foot. A Tamul has, however,\r\nimproved on this, as our readers will see by the following case,\r\ntaken before the justice of the peace:\r\n\r\nSome coolies of Agrawatte were led to believe that a vast\r\ntreasure of gems was secreted somewhere in the neighbourhood,\r\nand consulted their codangy on the subject; he heartily joined\r\nin the project of searching for the gems, and undertook to\r\ninvoke the demon in charge, and point out the exact locality\r\nwhere the gems were lying. For this purpose he made an\r\n\"anganam,\" composed of ingredients supposed to produce a\r\nmagic varnish, which, when rubbed on a betel-leaf, would show\r\nthe locality of the treasure, and allow of the codangy having a\r\npersonal interview with his satanic highness. In these invocations\r\nit is always customary for the priest to go into fits, which,\r\nfrom being feigned, often become (unintentionally) real. In\r\nthis case the codangy appears to have been unusually favoured\r\nby the devil, who revealed to him all secrets, including the fact\r\nthat the sacrifice of the first-born male of a human being was\r\nthe only means of attaining the coveted treasure. This revelation\r\nwas so explained by the codangy to his three partners, one\r\nof whom, having a first-born son, at once objected (blood was\r\nhere stronger than avarice), and withdrew from the co-partnership.\r\nThe other three were determined on making their\r\nfortunes, and again consulted the oracle, when the codangy\r\ninsisted on a human sacrifice as the only mode of obtaining the\r\nriches. The same evening the first-born of the objecting party\r\nwas missing. He at once informed the superintendent of the\r\nestate, and search was made for the boy. The police were\r\ninformed, and Inspector Davis and two constables proceeded",
  "p1230.png": "to the spot, and apprehended the codangy and another on\r\nsuspicion. Next day the poor boy was found in a bush with\r\nhis throat cut, and every appearance of the blood having been\r\ntaken to ensure 'Old Nick's' grace. One of the partners has\r\ndisappeared, and he is supposed to have been the cut-throat.\r\nThe case is adjourned until the apprehension of the absconding\r\nparty. This shows a depravity among the Tamuls not hitherto\r\nknown to the planters.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Hallywell, who follows \"Marcus the Eremite,\r\na skilful d\u00e6monist,\" there are six kinds of demons, \"the fifth\r\nsort of which are subterranean, living in caverns and hollows of\r\nthe earth, often hurting and killing well-diggers and miners for\r\nmetals, causing earthquakes and eruptions of flames, and\r\npestilent winds.[**typo? need for \" here? ]\r\n\r\nThe existence of spirits, or elemental beings, was a devout\r\nbelief among miners; frequent accidents in mines showed the\r\npotency of the metallic spirits, which so tormented the workmen\r\nin German mines, and in those of other countries, by\r\nblindness, giddiness, and sudden sickness, that they were\r\nobliged frequently to abandon mines well known to be rich in\r\nmetals. A metallic spirit, at one sweep, annihilated twelve\r\nminers, who were all found dead together. The fact was unquestionable,\r\nand the safety-lamp was undiscovered.\r\n\r\nMalignity was constantly ascribed to the goblins of the\r\nmines. We are told by a demonologist quoted by Reginald\r\nScot, \"that they do exceedingly envy man's benefit in the discovery\r\nof hidden treasure, ever haunting such places where\r\nmoney is concealed, and diffusing malevolent and poisonous\r\ninfluences to blast the lives and limbs of those that dare\r\nattempt the discovery thereof. Peter of Devonshire, with his\r\nconfederates, who by conjuration endeavoured to dig for such\r\ndefended treasures, was crumbled to atoms, as it were, being\r\nreduced to ashes with his confederates in the twinkling of an\r\neye.\"[*]\r\n\r\n* \"Modern authors,\" says Fuller, \"avouch that malignant spirits haunt\r\nthe places where precious metals are found, as if the devil did there sit",
  "p1240.png": "\r\nPeter of Devonshire sought his fate. But the demons of\r\nhaunted mines were considered as most tremendous. \"The\r\nnature of such is very violent; they do often slay whole companies\r\nof labourers; they do sometimes send inundations that\r\ndestroy both the mines and miners; they bring noxious and\r\nmalignant vapours to stifle the laborious workman; briefly, their\r\nwhole delight and faculty consists in killing, tormenting, and\r\ncrushing men who seek such treasures. Such was Aunabergius,\r\na most virulent animal, that utterly confounded the undertakings\r\nof those that laboured in the richest silver mine in\r\nGermany, called Corona Rosacea. He would often show himself\r\nin the likeness of a he-goat, with golden horns, pushing\r\ndown the workmen with great violence; sometimes like a horse,\r\nbreathing pestilence and flames from his nostrils. At other\r\ntimes he represented a monk in all his pontificals, flouting at\r\ntheir labour, and treating all their actions with scorn and indignation,\r\ntill by his daily and continual molestation he gave them\r\nno further ability of perseverance.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a traditionary story in North Ayrshire of a miner\r\nwho was constantly annoyed while working in a pit by hearing\r\nthe sounds of a pick on the other side of the coal into which\r\nhe was digging. The noise went on, day after day coming\r\nnearer, until he became convinced that it could be no other\r\nthan the devil, who was working through to him. He went to\r\nhis master and wanted to be relieved from his work, but without\r\nsuccess, and he was obliged to return to the post of danger.\r\nAt length his misery became unbearable, and he resolved to\r\napply to the minister to protect him from the machinations of\r\nthe enemy. This the minister undertook to do, and having\r\nasked him how many \"holings\" (the depth of coal displaced\r\nby one blasting) he had, before the wall between him and the\r\nevil spirit could be broken through, sent him back to work until\r\nhe had only one holing between them. Then he was to take\r\n\r\nabrood to hatch them, cunningly pretending an unwillingness to part with\r\nthem; whereas, indeed, he gains more by one mine minted out into money\r\nthan by a thousand concealed in the earth.\"",
  "p1250.png": "his piece of bread, and crumble it all down in a train to the\r\nmouth of the pit, and again resuming his pick, to strike through\r\nthe dividing coal. The moment this was done, and before the\r\ndevil could claim it, he was to cry, \"The hole's mine!\" and\r\nmake for the mouth of the pit as fast as he could. These\r\ndirections the miner carefully followed. He struck through the\r\ncoal, claimed the hole, and reached the pit's mouth safely; but\r\nthe evil spirit would certainly have caught him had he not been\r\nobliged to pick up every one of the crumbs scattered in the line\r\nof pursuit. As it was, the poor man had a narrow escape, for\r\nhe had no sooner reached his place of safety than the walls of\r\nthe pit came together with a thundering crash.\r\n\r\nEven now, when a coal-miner strikes through into a hole, or\r\nwhen two working from opposite sides at the same seam meet,\r\nthe coal is claimed by the one who shouts first, \"The hole's\r\nmine!\"\r\n\r\nTHE belief of the miner was strong in a species of aerial\r\nbeings called \"Knockers.\" These, the Welsh and\r\nCornish miners solemnly affirm, were heard under-ground, in\r\nor near mines; and by their knocking pointed out to the workmen\r\na rich vein of ore. In the third volume of \"Selections\r\nfrom the Gentleman's Magazine,\" there are two letters on the\r\nsubject of Knockers, written by Mr. Lewis Morris, a gentleman\r\nesteemed no less for his learning and benevolence than for his\r\ngood sense and integrity. \"People,\" he says, \"who know very\r\nlittle of arts and sciences, or the powers of nature, will laugh at\r\nus Cardiganshire miners, who maintain the existence of\r\n'Knockers' in mines, a kind of good-natured, impalpable\r\npeople, not to be seen, but heard, and who seem to us to work\r\nin the mines: that is to say, they are the types or forerunners\r\nof working in mines, as dreams are of some accidents which\r\nhappen to us. Before the discovery of Esgair y Mwyn Mine, these\r\nlittle people worked hard there day and night, and there are\r\nabundance of honest, sober people who have heard them; but\r\nafter the discovery of the great mine, they were heard no more.",
  "p1260.png": "When I began to work at Llwyn Llwyd, they worked so fresh\r\nthere for a considerable time that they frightened away some\r\nyoung workmen. This was when we were driving levels, and\r\nbefore we had got any ore; but when we came to the ore, they\r\nthen gave over, and I heard no more of them. These are odd\r\nassertions, but they are certainly facts, although we cannot, and\r\ndo not, pretend to account for them. We have now (October,\r\n1754) very good ore at Llwyn Llwyd, where the Knockers were\r\nheard to work; but they have now yielded up the place, and\r\nare heard no more. Let who will laugh, we have the greatest\r\nreason to rejoice, and thank the 'Knockers,' or rather God,\r\nwho sends us these notices.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kingsley, in \"Yeast,\" thus alludes to the superstition of\r\nthe Cornish miners respecting the \"Knockers\": \"They are\r\nthe ghosts, the miners hold, of the Old Jews that crucified our\r\nLord, and were sent for slaves by the Roman emperors to work\r\nthe mines; and we find their old smelting-houses, which we\r\ncall Jews' Houses, and their blocks at the bottom of the great\r\nbogs, which we call Jews' tin; and then a town among us, too,\r\nwhich we call Market Jew, but the old name was Marazion,\r\nthat means the Bitterness of Zion, they tell me; and bitter\r\nwork it was for them, poor souls! We used to break into the\r\nold shafts and adits which they had made, and find old stag's-horn\r\npickaxes, that crumbled to pieces when we brought them\r\nto grass. And they say that if a man will listen on a still night\r\nabout those old shafts, he may hear the ghosts of them at work,\r\nknocking and picking, as clear as if there was a man at\r\nwork in the next level.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt relates a curious story of the fairy miners, the\r\n\"Knockers.\" At Ransom Mine the \"Knockers\" were always\r\nvery active in their subterranean operations. In every part of\r\nthe mine the knockings were heard, but more especially they\r\nwere busy in one particular \"end.\" There was a general impression\r\nthat great wealth must exist at this part of the \"lode.\"\r\nYet, notwithstanding inducements were held out to the miners,\r\nno pair of men could be found brave enough to venture on the",
  "p1270.png": "ground of the \"Bockles.\" An old man and his son, called\r\nTrenwith, who lived near Bosprenis, went out one midsummer\r\neve about midnight, and watched until they saw the \"Smae\r\nPeople\" bringing up the shining ore. It is said they were\r\npossessed of some secret by which they could communicate\r\nwith the fairy people. Be this as it may, they told the little\r\nminers that they could save them all the trouble of breaking\r\ndown the ore; that they would bring up for them one-tenth of\r\nthe richest stuff, and leave it properly dressed, if they would\r\nquietly give them up this end. An agreement of some kind\r\nwas come to. The old man and his son took the \"pitch,\" and\r\nin a short time realised much wealth. The old man never\r\nfailed to keep to his bargain, and leave the tenth of the ore for\r\nhis fairy friends. He died. His son was avaricious and selfish.\r\nHe sought to cheat the \"Knockers,\" but he mined himself by\r\nso doing. The \"lode\" failed; nothing answered with him;\r\ndisappointed, he took to drink, squandered all the money his\r\nfather had made, and died a beggar.\r\n\r\nIN a communication from the Colliery Guardian (May 23,\r\n1863), we find a correspondence between the superstitions\r\nof the coal-miner and those employed in the metalliferous mines:\r\n\"The superstitions of the pitmen were once many and terrible;\r\nbut so far from existing nowadays, they are only matters of\r\ntradition among the old men. One class only of superstitions\r\ndoes exist among a few of the older and less-educated pitmen--namely,\r\nthe class of omens, warnings, and signs. If one of\r\nthese pitmen meet or see a woman, if he catch but a glimpse of\r\nher draperies, on his way in the middle of the night to the pit,\r\nthe probability is that he returns home again, and goes to bed.\r\nThe appearance of a woman at this untimely hour has often\r\nmaterially impeded the day's winning, for the omen is held not\r\nto be personal to the individual perceiving it, but to bode\r\ngeneral ill-luck to all. The walk from home to pit-mouth,\r\nalways performed at dead of night, was the period when omens\r\nwere mostly to be looked for. The supernatural appearance of",
  "p1280.png": "a little white animal like a rabbit, which was said to cross the\r\nminer's path, was another warning not to descend. Sometimes\r\nthe omens were rather mental than visual. The pitmen in the\r\nMidland counties have, or had, a belief, unknown to the north,\r\nin aerial whistlings, warning them against the pit. Who or\r\nwhat the invisible musicians were, nobody pretended to know;\r\nbut for all that, they must have been counted, and found to\r\nconsist of seven, as the 'Seven Whistlers'[*] is the name they\r\nbear to this day. Two goblins were believed to haunt the\r\nnorthern mines. One was a spiteful elf, who indicated his\r\npresence only by the mischief he perpetrated. He rejoiced in\r\nthe name of 'Cutty Soams,' and appears to have employed\r\nhimself only in the stupid device of severing the rope-traces, or\r\nsoams, by which an assistant putter, honoured by the title of\r\n'the fool,' is yoked to the tub. The strands of hemp, which\r\nwere left all sound in the board at 'kenner-time,' were found\r\nnext morning severed in twain. 'Cutty Soams' has been at\r\nwork, would the fool and his driver say, dolefully knotting the\r\ncord. The other goblin was altogether a more sensible and,\r\nindeed, an honest and hard-working bogie, much akin to the\r\nScotch brownie, or the hairy fiend whom Milton rather scurvily\r\napostrophises as a lubber. The supernatural personage in\r\nquestion was no other than a ghostly putter, and his name was\r\n'Bluecap.' Sometimes the miners would perceive a light blue\r\nflame flicker through the air, and settle on a full coal-tub, which\r\nimmediately moved towards the rolley-way, as though impelled\r\nby the sturdiest sinews in the working. Industrious Bluecap\r\nwas at his vocation; but he required, and rightly, to be paid for\r\n\r\n* In the Times (September 21, 1874) we find a curious instance of the\r\ndeep-rooted superstitions of miners. A large number of the men employed\r\nat some of the Bedworth Collieries, in North Warwickshire, refused to\r\ndescend the coal-pits in which they were employed. The men were credulous\r\nenough to believe that certain nocturnal sounds, which are doubtless\r\nproduced by flocks of night-birds in their passage across the country, are\r\nharbingers of some impending disaster. During Sunday night it was\r\nstated that these sounds, which have been designated the \"Seven Whistlers,\"\r\nhad been distinctly heard in the neighbourhood of Bedworth, and the result\r\nwas that on the following morning, when labour should have been resumed,\r\nthe men positively refused to work.",
  "p1290.png": "his services, which he modestly rated as those of an ordinary\r\naverage putter; therefore, once a fortnight, Bluecap's wages\r\nwere left for him in a solitary corner of the mine. If they were\r\na farthing below his due, the indignant Bluecap would not\r\npocket a stiver; if they were a farthing above his due, indignant\r\nBluecap left the surplus where he found it. The writer asked\r\nhis informant, a hewer, whether, if Bluecap's wages were\r\nnowadays to be left for him, he thought they would be appropriated.\r\nThe man shrewdly answered, he thought they would\r\nbe taken by Bluecap, or somebody else!\"\r\n\r\nOf the above notions it must be understood that the idea of\r\nomens is the only one still seriously entertained, and even its\r\nhold upon the popular mind, as I have before stated, is becoming\r\nweaker and weaker.\r\n\r\nTHE belief in apparitions still exists among the miners of\r\nDean Forest, that picturesque, hilly tract in the west of\r\nGloucestershire. The Dean miners were once a lawless set,\r\nleading a wild life in their sylvan solitudes, and not only enjoying\r\nmany ancient privileges granted to them, but others of their\r\nown creation, giving much trouble to the Government in consequence.\r\nMany of these forest miners also regard sickness and\r\naccident as fatal and inevitable.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt relates an interesting legend of Dorcas, the spirit\r\nof Polbreen Mine. In one of the small cottages which\r\nare near the works (situated at the foot of the hill known\r\nas St. Agnes Becon), once lived a woman called Dorcas.\r\nBeyond this we know little of her life, but we are concerned\r\nchiefly with her death, which, we are told, was suicidal.\r\n\r\nFrom some cause, which is not related, Dorcas grew weary\r\nof life, and one unholy night she left her house, and flung herself\r\ninto one of the deep shafts of Polbreen mine, at the bottom\r\nof which her dead and broken body was discovered. The\r\nremnant of humanity was brought to the surface, and after the\r\nlaws[** typo? law] of the time regarding suicides was fulfilled, the body of\r\nDorcas was buried. Her presence, however, still remained in",
  "p1300.png": "the mine. She appeared ordinarily to take a malicious delight\r\nin tormenting the industrious miner, calling him by name, and\r\nalluring him from his tasks. This was carried on by her to\r\nsuch an extent, that when a tributer had made a poor month,\r\nhe was asked \"if he had been chasing Dorcas.\"\r\n\r\nDorcas was usually only a voice. It has been said by some\r\nthat they have seen her in the mine, but this is doubted by the\r\nminers generally, who refer the spectral appearance to fear.\r\nBut it is stated as an incontrovertible fact, that more than one\r\nman who has met the spirit in the levels of the mine has had\r\nhis clothes torn off his back; whether in anger or in sport is\r\nnot clearly made out. On one occasion, and on one occasion\r\nonly, Dorcas appears to have acted kindly. Two miners, who\r\nfor distinction's sake we will call Martin and Jacky, were at\r\nwork in their end, and at the time busily at work \"beating the\r\nborer.\" The name of Jacky was distinctly uttered between the\r\nblows. He stopped and listened--all was still. They proceeded\r\nwith their task; a blow on the iron rod--\"Jacky.\"\r\nAnother blow--\"Jacky.\" They pause--all is silent. \"Well,\r\nthee wert called, Jacky,\" said Martin; \"go and see.\" Jacky\r\nwas, however, either afraid, or he thought himself the fool of\r\nhis senses. Work was resumed, and \"Jacky! Jacky! Jacky!\"\r\nwas called more vehemently and distinctly than before. Jacky\r\nthrew down his heavy hammer, and went from his companion,\r\nresolved to satisfy himself as to the caller. He had not proceeded\r\nmany yards from the spot on which he had been standing\r\nat work, when a mass of rock fell from the roof of the level,\r\nweighing many tons, which would have crushed him to death.\r\nMartin had been stooping, holding the borer, and a projecting\r\ncorner of rock just above him turned off the falling mass. He\r\nwas securely enclosed, and they had to dig him out, but he\r\nescaped without injury. Jacky declared to his dying day that\r\nhe owed his life to Dorcas.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this story, Mr. John Lean writes to the\r\nWest Briton, Truro newspaper, relating an extraordinary\r\nevent that happened to him some years ago, when he was",
  "p1310.png": "underground at Wheal Jewell, a mine in the parish of Gwennap,\r\nhis native parish, and in a part which he had never previously\r\nvisited. He was alone, and hundreds of fathoms distant from\r\nany other human being; thus, as it were, excluded from the\r\nliving world, he was walking slowly and silently through the\r\nlevel, his thoughts as it were absorbed, examining the rich course\r\nof copper ore in the roof or back, when, with the sudden\r\nquickness of the lightning-flash, he was aroused as though by\r\nan audible voice, \"You are in the winze.\" He at once threw\r\nhimself flat on his back in the bottom of the level, and on\r\nshifting from this posture to that of a sitting one, he found that\r\nhis heels were on the immediate verge of the end of a winze,\r\nthe existence of which he was, of course, unaware of, left\r\nexposed and open, embracing all the width of the gunnis, and\r\ncommunicating with the next level, ten fathoms below! At\r\nthe moment he received this singular--say supernatural--warning,\r\nhis foot was lifted for the next step over the mouth\r\nof this abyss, a step to eternity had it not thus been prevented.\r\n\r\nA troublesome imp called Gathon perplexed the miners in\r\nvarious ways, one of which was deluding them with false lights,\r\nnoises, and flames. Such was the spirit supposed to have\r\nfrightened three miners in the South Devon Wharf Mine a few\r\nyears ago. These men, while engaged at their work on a Saturday\r\nnight, suddenly saw a large ball of fire issue from a rock,\r\nand with a rumbling noise advance towards them. On its approach\r\nit assumed a variety of forms, sometimes that of a human\r\nfigure, then of a church with arched windows, pillars, etc. The\r\nmen were terrified, and conscience reproached them that Sunday\r\nhad commenced on their unfinished labours, and they fully\r\nbelieved they saw and were pursued by an evil spirit. The explanation\r\nfor this phenomenon would seem to be, that it is not\r\nvery uncommon of inflammable gas to issue from the backs of\r\nlodes, which ignites as soon as it comes in contact with the\r\noxygen of the atmosphere. The ground where these men were\r\nworking was full of iron and tin lodes, and there can be no",
  "p1320.png": "doubt that their fears not only gave the name, but also the\r\nshapes to the meteor.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous exhalations that are sometimes encountered\r\nin mines may account for the statement of Dr. Morret, in his\r\naccount of the Cornish mines, published in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions.\" \"The miners,\" he tells us, \"have stories of\r\nsprites of small people, as they call them; and that when the\r\ndamp arises from the subterranean vaults they heard strange\r\nnoises, horrid knockings, and fearful hammerings. These damps\r\nrender many lame, and kill others outright, without any visible\r\nhurt upon them.\"[*]\r\n\r\nThe ghostly sights seen by miners show themselves in various\r\nshapes, and we have in a Merthyr newspaper of a few years\r\nago, a revival of the corpse-candle. A hauler employed in\r\nCyfarthfa Mine saw the apparition three times in the shape of\r\nan unsubstantial tram-road, upon which, drawn by an a\u00ebrial\r\nhorse, followed a train. Within this carriage lay the body of a\r\nman, mute, motionless, and death-like. Twice did the noiseless\r\napparition emerge from the earth, and twice was the warning\r\nneglected; at length, on its third appearance, the spectator\r\nplucked up courage, gazed upon the face of the spectre, and\r\nrecognised the well-known features of a companion. To slight\r\nsuch a manifestation would be tempting his own fate. The substantial\r\nminer was apprised that his shadow had appeared without\r\nhis permission, and the following day he fled from his fate\r\nto another colliery.\r\n\r\n* It is not uncommon in deep mines, where there are what the miners\r\ncall vugs, or where there are large pseudomorphous crystallizations, to hear\r\nloud and frequent explosions, and that on occasions and in situations where\r\nno miners are at work. These noises are believed by some miners to be\r\ncaused by the working of the pixies. The real cause is, however, the bursting\r\nopen of some of the crystals, hollows, and vugs, where the air or gas\r\nhad been confined under very high degrees of pressure. A miner at Tavistock\r\nbroke into one of these hollows, of considerable size and grotto-like\r\nappearance. It was richly studded with crystals of quartz and pyrites,\r\nwhich, by the light of his candle, had such a brilliant appearance as made\r\nthe man exclaim, \"I think I am in heaven!\" On being asked in what\r\nrespect it resembled heaven, he replied, \"It was so beautiful, he could compare\r\nit to nothing else than a Jew's shop!\"",

About thirty years since,\r\na man and a lad were engaged in sinking a shaft at Wheal Vor\r\nMine, when the lad, through carelessness or accident, missed in\r\ncharging a hole, so that a necessity arose for the dangerous\r\noperation of picking out the charge. This they proceeded to\r\ndo, the man severely reprimanding the carelessness of his\r\nassistant. Several other miners at the time being about to\r\nchange their core, were on the plat above, calling down and\r\nconversing occasionally with the man and boy. Suddenly the\r\ncharge exploded, and the latter was seen to be blown up in the\r\nmidst of a volume of flame. As soon as help could be procured,\r\na party descended, when the remains of the poor fellows\r\nwere found to be shattered and scorched beyond recognition.\r\nWhen these were brought to the surface, the clothes and a mass\r\nof mangled flesh dropped from the bodies. A bystander, to\r\nspare the feelings of the relatives, hastily caught up the revolting\r\nmass in a shovel, and threw the whole into the blazing furnace of\r\nWoolf's engine close at hand. From that time the engineman\r\ndeclared that troops of little black dogs continually haunted\r\nthe place, even when the doors were shut. Few of them liked\r\nto talk about it; but it was difficult to obtain the necessary\r\nattendance to work the machine.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by the peasantry living near Largo-Law, Scotland,\r\nthat a rich mine of gold is concealed in the mountain.\r\nA spectre once appeared there, supposed to be the guardian of\r\nthe mine, who being accosted by a neighbouring shepherd, promised\r\nto tell him at a certain time, and on certain conditions,\r\nwhere \"the gowd mine is in Largo-Law,\" especially enjoining\r\nthat the horn sounded for the housing of the cows at the adjoining\r\nfarm of Balmain should not blow. Every precaution",
  "p1340.png": "having been taken, the ghost was true to his tryst; but, unhappily,\r\nwhen he was about to divulge the desired secret, Tammie Norrie,\r\nthe cowherd of Balmain, blew a blast loud and dread. Whereupon\r\nthe ghost vanished, with the denunciation:\r\n\r\n\"Woe to the man that blew the horn,\r\nFor out of the spot he shall ne'er be borne.\"\r\n\r\nThe unlucky horn-blower was struck dead, and as it was found\r\nimpossible to remove the body, a cairn of stones was raised\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nIN the Oswestry Advertiser (May, 1874) is a curious instance\r\nof the superstition of Welsh colliers. The news is from\r\nCefn: \"A woman is employed as messenger at one of the\r\ncollieries, and as she commences her duty early each morning,\r\nshe meets great numbers of colliers going to their work. Some\r\nof them, we are gravely assured, consider it a bad omen to\r\nmeet a woman the first thing in the morning, and not having\r\nsucceeded in deterring her from her work by other means, they\r\nwaited upon the manager, and declared that they would remain\r\nat home unless the woman was dismissed. The result our\r\ninformant mentions not; but we may reasonably hope that\r\nthe poor woman was not sacrificed to the superstition of the\r\nmen.\"[*]\r\n\r\nIf a Cornish miner, on his way to night-work, meets a\r\nstranger, and receives no answer to the customary \"Good-*night\"\r\ngreeting, he reckons it as an omen of ill-luck, or something\r\nworse. \"Ill-wishing\" and \"overlooking,\" which are\r\nnearly identical with the \"evil eye,\" are delusions still existing\r\namong the miners. A sinister look, or a muttered expression\r\nof discontent, is carefully treasured up by the object of it, and\r\n\r\n* It is curious to see the same superstition existing among the fishermen\r\nof Yorkshire, and other parts of England. At Staithes, in Cleveland, if\r\na fisherman happens to meet a female first on leaving his cottage, to put\r\nout to sea, he will turn back again, as he firmly believes that all his luck\r\nwould be spoiled for the day.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to this superstition as prevalent among colliers, in an\r\nextract from the Colliery Guardian, May 23rd, 1803.",

It is supposed that the devil\r\nalways travels in circles, and is consequently interrupted when\r\nhe arrives at either of the heels of the shoe, and is obliged to\r\ntake a retrograde course.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall the ant is called by the peasantry a muryan.\r\nBelieving they are the \"small people\" in their state of decay\r\nfrom off the earth, it is considered most unlucky to destroy a\r\ncolony of ants.

During the \"holy evenings,\" between the Nativity\r\nand the Epiphany, the new-born divinity comes down from heaven and\r\nwanders about on earth, wherefore every sort of labour during that period\r\nis held to be a sin. At midnight, on the eve of each of these festivals, the\r\nheavenly doors are thrown open; the radiant realms of Paradise, in which\r\nthe sun dwells, disclose their treasures; the waters of rivers and springs\r\nbecome animated, turn into wine, and receive a healing efficacy; the trees\r\nput forth blossoms, and golden fruits ripen on their boughs.",

A miner informed Mr. Hunt that he\r\nhad often seen them, sitting on pieces of timber, or tumbling\r\nabout in curious attitudes, when he came to work.\r\n\r\nShakspeare addresses the\r\n\r\n\"Elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,\"\r\n\r\nand those\r\n\r\n\"Whose pastime\r\nIs to make midnight mushrooms.\"\r\n\r\nWe may conclude that fairy butter was not known in his\r\ntime, and was a later superstition; but the industrious gleaner,\r\nPennant, mentions that there is a substance found at a great\r\ndepth in crevices of limestone-rocks in seeking for lead-ore,\r\nnear Holywell, in Flintshire, which is called menyn, tylna, teg,\r\nor fairies' butter. This is a substance of nature's own churning,\r\nbut it affords a proof how strongly the \"little people\" kept\r\ntheir hold on the imaginations of miners, as well as others.\r\n\r\nVegetables growing in mines possessed certain talismanic\r\npowers among the German miners, so Lord Bacon tells us, and\r\nno one was allowed to gather them. The same writer mentions\r\nin his \"Sylva Sylvarum\" that \"in furnaces of copper and brass,\r\nwhere chalcite is often cast in to mend the working, there\r\nriseth suddenly a fly, which sometimes is seen moving, and\r\ndieth presently as soon as it is out of the furnace.\"\r\n\r\nMR. HUNT gives some curious instances of warnings\r\nand tokens among miners. The following, related by\r\na very respectacle[** typo? respectable] man, formerly a miner, illustrates this belief:\r\n\"My father, when a lad, worked with a companion (James, or",
  "p1370.png": "\"Jim,\" as he was called) in Germoe. They lived close by Old\r\nWheal Grey, in Breage. One evening the daughter of the\r\nperson with whom they lodged came in to her mother, crying:\r\n'Billy and Jim ben out theer for more than a hour, and I ben\r\nchasing them among the Kilyur banks, and they wa'ant let me\r\ncatch them. As fast as I do go to one, they do go to another.'\r\n'Hould your tongue, child,' said the mother; ''twas their\r\nforenoon core, and they both ben up in bed this hours.' 'I'm\r\nsure I ben chasin' them,' said the girl. The mother then went\r\nupstairs, and awoke the lads, telling them the story. One of\r\nthem said, ''Tis a warning; somethin' will happen in an old\r\nend, and I shan't go to mine this core.' 'Nonsense,' said the\r\nother; 'don't let us be so foolish; the child has been playing\r\nwith some strangers, and it isn't worth while to be spaled for\r\nsuch foolishness.' 'I tell you,' replied the other, 'I won't go.'\r\nAs it was useless for any man to go alone, both remained away.[**P2: unclear punctuation; looks more like a hyphen/dash to me ]\r\nIn the course of the night, however, a run took place in the\r\nend they were working in, and tens of thousands kibblesful\r\ncame away. Had they been at work it was scarcely possible\r\nfor them to have escaped.[**P2: missing closing quote mark ]\r\n\r\nAt Wheal Vor Mine it has always been, and is now, believed\r\nthat a fatal accident in the mine is presaged by the appearance\r\nof a hare, or white rabbit, in one of the engine-houses. The\r\nmen solemnly declare that they have chased some of these\r\nappearances till they were hemmed in apparently, without being\r\nable to catch them. The white rabbit being on one occasion\r\nrun into a wind-bore lying on the ground, though stopped in,\r\nescaped.[*]\r\n\r\nIn this mine there appears to be a general belief among the\r\n\r\n* The connection between a rabbit and a mine is mentioned by Addison\r\n(\"Dialogues on Medals\"), alluding to a Spanish coin, representing a\r\ngoddess with a rabbit at her feet: \"There are learned medalists that tell\r\nus the rabbit may signify either the great multitude of these animals that\r\nare found in Spain, or perhaps the several mines that are wrought within\r\nthe bowels of that country, the Latin word cuniculus signifying either a\r\nrabbit or a mine. But these gentlemen do not consider that it is not the\r\nword but the figure that appears on the medal. Cuniculus may stand for a\r\nrabbit or a mine, but the picture of a rabbit is not the picture of a mine.\"",
  "p1380.png": "men in \"tokens\" and supernatural appearances. A few\r\nmonths since, a fine old man reported, on being relieved from\r\nhis turn as watcher, that during the night he heard a loud\r\nsound, like the emptying of a cart-load of rubbish, in front of\r\nthe account-house where he was staying. On going out\r\nnothing was to be seen. The poor fellow, considering the\r\nstrange sound as a \"warning,\" pined away and died in a few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nTHE French miners have their superstitions, in common\r\nwith those of similar vocation in other countries. The\r\nwhite hare, which I have remarked as an ominous appearance\r\nto the miners in Cornwall, has also its legend in France, where\r\nit is believed to be a spirit haunting the subterranean caverns,\r\nand is called the \"little miner.\" A story similar to that related\r\nof Wheal Vor, states that one day a miner was frightened\r\nby seeing a white object run and conceal itself in an iron pipe;\r\nhe went forward, and stopped up the two ends of the tube, and\r\ncalled one of his fellow-workmen to examine the pipe with him.\r\nThey did so, but found nothing within; the hare-spirit had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe belief in mischievous sprites, or gnomes, is very\r\nprevalent; and these are of the same troublesome character as\r\nthose described by the German and English miners. If a tool\r\nis broken or lost, a lamp extinguished, clothes torn, or if\r\npieces of rock fall upon them, the French miners attribute all\r\nto the sprites. Work on Sunday is considered to bring some\r\ndisaster during the week. A miner, who had thus occupied\r\nhimself for a few minutes only in a coal-mine, was talking to\r\nthe manager, when he suddenly heard what he thought was the\r\nsound of a pick, and ascribing it to his having transgressed on\r\nthe Sabbath, became greatly terrified, and hastened to ascend\r\nthe shaft and quit the mine. The manager listened attentively,\r\nand heard the sounds repeated. Being of stronger nerves than\r\nthe other, he determined to find out if possible the meaning.\r\nHe went to the other end of the gallery, and soon discovered",
  "p1390.png": "the origin of the mysterious noises. A pick had been placed\r\nupright in the coal, and upon this drops of water were falling\r\nfrom the roof, producing the tic, tic, tic ascribed to supernatural\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nIf we may credit the narrative of Nicander Nucius (published\r\nby the Camden Society), the coal-miners of Li\u00e9ge, in the\r\nmiddle ages, instead of being assisted in their operations by\r\nelves or fairies, were, according to a monkish legend, indebted\r\nto an angel in the guise of a venerable sage, who first revealed\r\nto the peasants the existence of the coal, and made them\r\nacquainted with its use, and the mode of extracting it. The\r\nlatter process, however, was attended with fearful effects:\r\n\"When they meet with the mineral, they form a spacious\r\ncavern; but they are not able to throw out the stones (coal)\r\nimmediately, for fire on a sudden bursts forth, and encompasses\r\nthe whole cavern. When the miners are desirous of extracting\r\nthe coal, they put on a linen garment, which has neither been\r\nbleached nor dipped in water. This covers the frame from\r\nhead to foot, leaving only a certain aperture for the eyes....\r\nThey also take a staff in their hands.... The miner then\r\ndraws near to the fire, and frightens it with his staff. The fire\r\nthen flies away, and contracts, little by little; having then\r\nexpended itself, it collects together in a surprising manner, and\r\nbecoming very small, it remains quite still in a corner. But it\r\nbehoves the man who wears the linen garment to stand over\r\nthe flame when at rest, always terrifying it with his staff. While\r\nhe performs this service the miners extract the stones, but as\r\nsoon as they have left the cave, the dormant fire on a sudden\r\nbursts forth and environs the whole cave.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer, a Greek traveller of the sixteenth century,\r\nsatisfied himself of the reality of these marvels by personal\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nColumbus, during his voyages in the West Indies, noticed\r\nthat the Indians had a superstition when they went in search of\r\ngold; they were obliged to practise rigorous fasting. He looked\r\nupon gold as one of the sacred and mystic treasures of the",
  "p1400.png": "earth, and impressed upon his seamen the same notion, exhorting\r\nthem when searching for mines to practise fastings and\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican miners are very superstitious; sixty fathoms\r\ndown the \"Despaches,\" one of the entrances to Valenciana\r\nMine, is a church, where lamps are kept continually alight.\r\nThe miners usually spend half an hour in it on going to or\r\nreturning from work, and none of them pass without bowing\r\nto the painted images.\r\n\r\nAgricola mentions that \"demons and ghosts terrify the\r\nminers, and that this sort of apparitions cannot be prevented\r\nwithout prayer and fasting.[** \"]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Threshold of the Catholic Church,\" by the Rev.\r\nJ. B. Bagshawe, it is said: \"I have been told that in mining\r\ndistricts the Protestant miners come in crowds to get the\r\n'blessed palms' on Palm-Sunday, with the feeling that these\r\nwill preserve them from danger at their work.\"\r\n\r\nTHE German miners had their \"Kobolds\"[*] (a term from\r\nwhich the English Goblin and the Scottish Bogle are\r\nderived), a species of gnomes, or dwarfs, who appeared to\r\nimitate the labours of the miners, and sometimes took pleasure\r\nin frustrating their objects, and rendering their toil unfruitful.\r\nSometimes they were malignant, especially if neglected or\r\ninsulted, but at times they were indulgent to individuals whom\r\nthey took under their protection. When a miner, therefore, hit\r\nupon a rich vein of ore, the inference commonly was not that\r\nhe possessed more skill, industry, or even good luck than his\r\nfellow workmen, but that the spirits of the mine had directed\r\nhim to the treasure.\r\n\r\nA worse class of mine demons than the Kobolds, the\r\nknockers, and others, were the Knauff-kriegen, of whom\r\n\r\n* Bingley, in his \"Useful Knowledge\" (vol. i. p. 220), states that \"The\r\nmetal known by the name of Cobalt, is so called from the German Kobold,\r\nthe miners who dig for it appearing to be particularly subject to the vexations\r\nof the elf, in consequence of the poison which his namesake exhales.\"",
  "p1410.png": "Ramazzini, a professor at Padua, and who wrote on the\r\ndiseases of artificers, relates as follows: \"I took the story of\r\ndevils haunting mines to be fabulous, until I was undeceived\r\nby a skilful Hanoverian operator in metals, who is now\r\nemployed by our duke in tracing the metallic veins in the\r\nmountainous parts of Modena. For this man told me seriously,\r\nthat in the Hanoverian mines the diggers have frequent\r\nfalls, which they say are occasioned by their being knocked\r\ndown by devils, which they call Knauff-kriegen, and that after\r\nsuch falls they often die in the space of three or four days; but\r\nif they outlive that time they recover.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the various legends connected with mining in Germany,\r\nis one relating to the Kuttenberg, a mountain in\r\nBohemia. Three miners had worked there for several years,\r\nand had gained by their labour a sufficiency for their wives\r\nand children. Each morning they went to the mine, they\r\ntook with them three things: a prayer-book, a lamp with sufficient\r\noil for the day, and a loaf of bread. Before commencing\r\nwork they read prayers, and supplicated divine protection in\r\nthe mine. One day after working hard, and the evening was\r\ndrawing in, it happened that some rocks in the mine falling on\r\ntheir passage, prevented them from getting out of the mountain,\r\nand they found themselves in danger of being buried alive. They\r\nwere in great despair, as all their bread was consumed, and the\r\noil in the lamps was nearly exhausted; a horrible death seemed\r\nbefore them, and they prayed fervently for help, continuing\r\ntheir labour meanwhile. Marvellous to relate, that day by day,\r\nand year by year, for several long years (seven, according to\r\nthe tradition), the daily supply of bread and oil continued to\r\nbe provided by divine agency, and the seven years really\r\nappeared to them but one day. Meanwhile their hair and\r\nbeards grew to an enormous length. During this long incarceration,\r\nthe wives of the miners considered them dead, as\r\nevery effort to trace them was ineffectual.\r\n\r\nIt happened that one of the three miners, with a long-drawn\r\nsigh, deploring his condition, exclaimed, \"Ah! if I could but",
  "p1420.png": "see once more the light of day, I could die happy.\" The\r\nsecond said, \"Were I to sit at table once again with my wife, I\r\ncould leave the world in peace afterwards.\" The third declared\r\nthat his greatest wish was to spend a year with his wife. Suddenly\r\nthere was a fearful sound like thunder in the mine, the\r\nrocks separated, and the passage from the mountain was no\r\nlonger obstructed. The miner who had first expressed his wish\r\napproached the opening, but as soon as he saw the light of day,\r\nhe fell dead. The two other miners made their way out of the\r\nmine, and sought their houses, but their appearance was so\r\nchanged that their wives did not know them. \"What,\" said\r\nthe men, \"have you never been married?\" \"Yes,\" replied the\r\nwomen, \"but seven years ago our husbands were killed in the\r\nKuttenberg.\" One of the miners said to his wife, \"I am your\r\nhusband!\" but she would not believe it, until after he had\r\nshaved and washed himself, she recognised him. She expressed\r\ngreat joy at this, and placed food upon the table, and they sat\r\npleasantly eating and drinking together, when, on the last morsel\r\nbeing finished, the miner fell from his seat dead. The last of\r\nthe miners, after a year spent in comfort and happiness with\r\nhis wife, died, his wish having been prophetic.\r\n\r\nIn the mining districts of the Alps there was a strong belief\r\nin a spirit of the mountain called \"Master H\u0153mmerling,\" or\r\nmore usually known as the \"Monk of the Mountain,\" under\r\nthe figure of a giant covered with a black hood. He often\r\nappeared in a mine in the country of the Grisons, and there\r\nhis principal occupation, especially on the Friday, was to pour\r\nfrom one bucket to another the mineral extracted by the\r\nminers. The owner of the mine was obliged to allow this\r\nwithout saying anything, otherwise he would fare ill at the\r\nhands of the giant. It appears that a miner one day ridiculed\r\nthe idea of performing such useless labour, but the tight grasp\r\nof the spirit was soon round his throat, and he was nearly\r\nstrangled.\r\n\r\nOn the Annaberg, in a cavern called Rosenkranz, the giant\r\nbeing displeased with some miners working there, killed a",
  "p1430.png": "dozen of them, and the mine was afterwards abandoned. On\r\nthe Schneeberg, he appeared in the mine of St. George, under\r\nthe figure of a black monk, and seized a miner whom he precipitated\r\nto the ground with such violence that all his limbs\r\nwere broken. On the Hartz Mountains, he inflicted a retributary\r\npunishment on a mine-manager who had cruelly treated\r\nhis workmen. At the moment he was emerging from the pit,\r\nhe was seized by the spirit, and his head crushed.\r\n\r\nThere is another tradition concerning the monk of the\r\nHartz Mountains. Two miners, working in common, perceived\r\none day that they had not sufficient oil in their lamps\r\nto finish their work. \"What shall we do?\" they said; \"if our\r\nlight goes out we shall not be able to find our way out of the\r\nmine; and besides, there is the pit between us, which is\r\ndangerous to pass even with a light. If we go and obtain fresh\r\noil, the overseer will punish us, as he has done already.\"\r\nWhilst they were in this uncertainty, they perceived in the\r\ndistance a light that seemed to come near them, but they were\r\nhorrified on seeing in the person who carried it a frightful\r\ngigantic figure, covered with a dark cowl, as a monk. The\r\nlamp he carried was an ordinary miner's lamp, but of a prodigious\r\nsize. Addressing the miners, who were greatly terrified,\r\nhe said, \"Never fear, I will do you no harm, but rather serve\r\nyou.\" He took their lamp, poured some oil into it, and then\r\ntook a pick from one of them, and in an hour had done more\r\nwork than they could have managed in a week or more of heavy\r\nlabour. This finished, he said to them, \"Tell no one that\r\nyou have seen me.\" He then struck on a rock, which opened,\r\nand the miners saw a long gallery, covered throughout with\r\ngold and silver, which splendour so dazzled their eyes that the\r\nminers closed them for a few moments, after which the whole\r\ndisappeared. If they had thrown a pick into the gallery, it\r\nwould have remained open, and endless wealth would have\r\nbeen theirs; but having withdrawn their gaze, without this act,\r\nthey were left to grope their way out of the mine. Some years\r\nafterwards, at a drinking party, they had the imprudence to",
  "p1440.png": "relate this event to some roystering friends, and the next day,\r\nwhen they returned to work, their lamps were suddenly extinguished,\r\nand no oil would burn in them afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom a giant to an infinitesimal object like the smallest of\r\nfairies is a wide stretch, but it seems that in the mines of Germany\r\nthese tiny creatures, full of mischief, gave the laborious\r\nminers great trouble. They were said to wear similar clothes\r\nto the miner, and were also furnished with a lantern, a mallet,\r\nand a hammer. Full of caprices, they sometimes befriended\r\nthe miners by indicating the best lodes; but if any rude or\r\nuncivil words were addressed to them, they had their revenge\r\nby misleading the men, and terrifying them by loud and unusual\r\nnoises. In the mines of the Kuttenberg in Bohemia,\r\nthese creatures were frequently seen in great numbers descending\r\nand ascending the pits, particularly when some great misfortune\r\nwas about to happen. The miners heard them scraping,\r\ndigging, and striking the rocks, and if any forge was at work,\r\nthere the tiny folk were full of business, which caused them\r\nto be called by the Bohemians, little domestic smiths. In Idria\r\nthe miners placed in a particular spot, every day, food for them;\r\nevery year also they bought a little jacket, which they left in the\r\nsame place as a present, to conciliate the fairies.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that the death of a miner was announced by\r\ntheir striking three times at his door.\r\n\r\nAnother tradition of the Hartz Mountains relates to the\r\nrichest silver mines there, which were called the \"Great John\"\r\nand the Golden Altar (near Andreasberg), but which have been\r\nabandoned for many years. It seems that formerly, when these\r\nmines were in full operation, they were in charge of a manager\r\nwho used to conceal two blocks of the precious metal, so as to\r\nbe able at need, when the produce was not sufficient to supply\r\nthe deficiency, and thus make the return of the mine as equal\r\nas possible. This was done with a good intention, but on an\r\naccusation of theft he was condemned to death. At the place\r\nof execution he protested in his innocence, and said: \"It is\r\nas sure that I am not guilty, as that my blood will change into",
  "p1450.png": "milk, and that the two mines will not be worked when the lord\r\nto whom they belong will have a son born with eyes of crystal\r\nand feet of a goat. When the executioner struck the fatal\r\nblow, instead of blood, a stream of milk gushed forth, a proof\r\nof the mine-manager's innocence. The two mines were soon\r\nabandoned, on the circumstance of a son being born to the\r\nlord under the sinister forms foretold.\r\n\r\nTHE belief in the Divining-Rod existed from the earliest\r\nages. The staff of Hermes was venerated by the Greeks\r\nand Romans, and they also had their \"wish-rods\" like ourselves,\r\nor, at least, traditions of such objects is plain from sundry\r\npassages in their writers. One of them, which the author of\r\n\"Charicles\" has cited from Arrian, is this: \"He has a bad\r\nfather, but I have a good one, and that is the staff of Hermes.\r\nTouch what you will with it, they say, and it turns to gold.\"\r\nAnother is the well-known passage in Tully's Offices: \"But\r\nwere all the necessaries of life supplied to us by means of a\r\ndivine rod (virgula divina) then,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTacitus tells us that the Germans practised some arts of\r\ndivination by means of rods: \"For the purpose their method\r\nis simple. They cut a rod off some fruit-trees into bits, and\r\nafter having distinguished them by various marks, they cast\r\nthem into a white cloth.... Then the priest thrice draws\r\neach piece, and explains the oracle according to the marks.\"\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus says that the Alains employed an osier\r\nrod.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the divining-rod depended upon many\r\nspecial conditions. It was always to be performed after sunset\r\nand before sunrise, and only on certain nights, among which\r\nare specified those of Good Friday, Epiphany, Shrove Tuesday,\r\nSt. John's Day, and the first night of a new moon, or that preceding\r\nit. In cutting it, one must face the east, so that the rod\r\nshall be one which catches the first rays of the morning sun;\r\nor, as some say, the eastern and western sun must shine through\r\nthe fork of the rod, otherwise it will be good for nothing. Such,",
  "p1460.png": "also, were the directions given in the Vedas with respect to the\r\n\"sami\" branch, and the \"arani.\" They were to be cut at\r\nnew moon, or on the night before it, and none were to be chosen\r\nbut such as grew towards the east, the north, or straight upwards.\r\nThis last peculiarity has also been recognised as proper\r\nto the wishing, or divining-rod, to which a medi\u00e6val poet of\r\nGermany compares the form and carriage of the Greek Helen:\r\n\r\n\"Fair as a wish-rod came she gliding upright.\"\r\n\r\nThe middle ages was the date of the full development of the\r\nsuperstition concerning the divining-rod, which was believed\r\nefficacious in discovering hidden treasures, veins of precious\r\nmetal, etc. The first notice of its general use among late\r\nwriters is in the \"Testamentum Novum\" of Basil Valentine,\r\na Benedictine monk of the fifteenth century. Basil speaks of\r\nthe general faith in, and adoption of this valuable instrument\r\nfor the discovery of metals, which is carried by workmen in\r\nmines, either in their belts or in their caps. He says that\r\nthere are seven names by which this rod is known, and to its\r\nexcellences under each title he devotes a chapter of each book.\r\nThe names are: Divine Rod, Shining Rod, Leaping Rod,\r\nTranscendent Rod, Trembling Rod, Dipping Rod, Superior\r\nRod. Agricola, in his treatise on metals, speaks of the rod in\r\nterms of disparagement; he considers its use as a relic of\r\nancient magical forms, and he says it is only irreligious workmen\r\nwho employ it in their search after metals. The Jesuit,\r\nKircher, \"experimentalized\" several times on wooden rods\r\nwhich were declared to be sympathetic with regard to certain\r\nmetals, by placing them on delicate pivots in equilibrium, but\r\nthey never turned on the approach of metal. Another Jesuit,\r\nGaspard Schott (1659), states that the rod was then used in\r\nevery town in Germany, and that he had frequent opportunity\r\nof seeing it employed in the discovery of hidden treasures.\r\n\"I searched with the greatest care,\" he adds, \"into the question\r\nwhether the hazel-rod had any sympathy with gold and\r\nsilver, and whether any natural property set it in motion. In",
  "p1470.png": "like manner, I tried whether a ring of metal, suspended by a\r\nthread in the midst of a tumbler, and which strikes the hours,\r\nis moved by any similar force. I ascertained that these effects\r\ncould only have arisen from the deception of those holding the\r\nrod or the pendulum, or, maybe, from some diabolic impulsion,\r\nor, more likely still, because imagination sets the hand in\r\nmotion.\"\r\n\r\nThe astrologer Lilly was unsuccessful with the divining-rod,\r\nwhich induced him to surrender the pursuit of rhabdomancy, in\r\nwhich he first engaged, though he still persevered in asserting\r\nthat the operation demanded secrecy and intelligence in the\r\nagents, and above all, a strong faith, and a competent knowledge\r\nof their work. The Dean of Westminster had given him\r\npermission to search for treasure in the cloister of the Abbey in\r\nthe dead of night. On the western side, the rods turned over\r\neach other with inconceivable rapidity; yet, on digging, nothing\r\nbut a coffin could be discovered. Lilly retired to the Abbey,\r\nand then a storm arose which nearly destroyed the west end of\r\nthe church, extinguished all the candles but one (and this\r\nburned dimly), and made the rods immovable. Lilly succeeded\r\nat length in charming away the demon, but no persuasion could\r\ninduce him to make another experiment in that species of\r\ndivination.\r\n\r\nLilly, relating this adventure in his \"Memoirs,\" adds, \"that\r\nthe true miscarriage of the business was by reason of so many\r\npeople being present at the operation, for there were about\r\nthirty, some laughing, others deriding us; so that if we had not\r\ndismissed the demons, I believe most part of the Abbey church\r\nwould have been blown away; secresy, and intelligent operators,\r\nwith a strong confidence and knowledge of what they are\r\ndoing, are best for this work.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Shepherd's Kalendar, or the Citizen and Countryman's\r\nCompanion,\" an old chap-book, there is a receipt to\r\nmake the \"Mosaic Wand to find hidden treasure\" without the\r\nintervention of a human operator: \"Cut a hazel-wand forked\r\nat the upper end like a Y. Peel off the rind, and dry it in a",
  "p1480.png": "moderate heat; then steep it in the juice of wake-robin, or\r\nnightshade, and cut the single lower end sharp, and where you\r\nsuppose any rich mine or hidden treasure is near, place a piece\r\nof the same mettal you conceive is hid, or in the earthe to the\r\ntop of one of the forks by a hair, or very fine silk or thread, and\r\ndo the like to the other end; pitch the sharp single end lightly\r\nto the ground, at the going down of the sun, the moon being\r\nin the encrease, and in the morning at sunrise, by a natural\r\nsympathy, you will find the mettal inclining, as it were pointing\r\nto the places where the other is hid.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Athenian Oracle\" the experiment of a hazel's\r\ntendency to a vein of lead-ore is limited to St. John Baptist's\r\nEve, and that with a hazel of the same year's growth.\r\n\r\nSwift, in his lines on \"The Virtues of Sid Hamet the\r\nMagician's Rod\" (1710), says:\r\n\r\n\"They tell us something strange and odd,\r\nAbout a certain magic rod,\r\nThat, bending down its top, divines\r\nWhene'er the soil has golden mines;\r\nWhere there are none, it stands erect,\r\nScorning to show the least respect;\r\nAs ready was the wand of Sid,\r\nTo bend where golden mines were hid;\r\nIn Scottish hills found precious ore,\r\nWhere none e'er look'd for it before;\r\nAnd by a gentle bow divined\r\nHow well a cully's purse was lin'd\r\nTo a forlorn and broken rake,\r\nStood without motion, like a stake.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" (February, 1752) we read:\r\n\"M. Linn\u00e6us, when he was on his voyage to Scania, hearing\r\nhis secretary highly extol the virtues of his divining-wand, was\r\nwilling to convince him of its insufficiency, and for that purpose\r\nconcealed a purse of one hundred ducats under a ranunculus,\r\nwhich grew by itself in a meadow, and bid the secretary find it\r\nif he could. The wand discovered nothing, and M. Linn\u00e6us's\r\nmark was soon trampled down by the company who were\r\npresent; so that when M. Linn\u00e6us went to finish the experiment\r\nby fetching the gold himself, he was utterly at a loss",
  "p1490.png": "where to seek it. The man with the wand assisted him, and\r\npronounced that it could not be in the way they were going,\r\nbut quite the contrary, so pursued the direction of his wand,\r\nand actually dug out the gold. M. Linn\u00e6us adds that such\r\nanother experiment would be sufficient to make a proselyte of\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1790, Pennet, a native of Dauphin\u00e9, claimed a power\r\nover the divining-rod, which attracted attention in Italy, but\r\nwhen carefully tested by scientific men in Padua, his attempts\r\nto discover buried metals failed; at Florence he was detected\r\nin an endeavour to find out by night what had been secreted to\r\ntest his powers on the morrow.\r\n\r\nBillingsley, in his \"Agricultural Survey of the County of\r\nSomerset\" (1797), speaks of the faith held in that county by\r\nthe Mendip miners, in the efficacy of the divining-rod: \"The\r\ngeneral method of discovering the situation and direction of\r\nthose seams of ore (which lie at various depths, from five to\r\ntwenty fathoms, in a chasm between two inches of solid rock)\r\nis by the help of the divining-rod, vulgarly called josing; and a\r\nvariety of strong testimonies are adduced in supporting this\r\ndoctrine. Most rational people, however, give but little credit\r\nto it, and consider the whole as a trick. Should the fact be\r\nallowed, it is difficult to account for it; and the influence of\r\nthe mines on the hazel-rod seems to partake so much of the\r\nmarvellous, as almost entirely to exclude the operation of\r\nknown and natural agents. So confident, however, are the\r\ncommon miners of the efficacy, that they scarcely ever sink a\r\nshaft but by its direction; and those who are dexterous in the\r\nuse of it, will mark on the surface the course and breadth of\r\nthe vein; and after that, with the assistance of the rod, will\r\nfollow the same course twenty times following blindfolded.\"\r\n\r\nTHE tradition of the discovery of tin in Cornwall attributes\r\nit to St. Piran, or St. Perran, the patron of tinners.\r\nMr. Hunt thus relates the legend: The saint, leading his lonely\r\nlife on the plains that now bear his name, devoted himself to",
  "p1500.png": "the study of the objects which presented themselves to his\r\nnotice. He decorated the altar in his church with the choicest\r\nflowers, and his cell was adorned with the crystals which he\r\ncould collect from the neighbouring rocks. In his wanderings\r\non the seashore, St. Perran could not but observe the numerous\r\nmineral-veins running through the slate-rocks forming the\r\nbeautiful cliffs on this coast. Examples of every kind he\r\ncollected; and on one occasion, when preparing his humble\r\nmeal, a heavy black stone was employed to form a part of the\r\nfire-place. The fire was more intense than usual, and a stream\r\nof beautiful white metal flowed out of the fire. Great was the\r\njoy of the saint; he perceived that God in His goodness had\r\ndiscovered to him something that would be useful to man.\r\nHe communicated his discovery to St. Chiwidden. They\r\nexamined the shores together, and Chiwidden, who was learned\r\nin the wisdom of the East, soon devised a process for producing\r\nthis metal in large quantities. The two saints called the\r\nCornishmen together. They told them of their treasures, and\r\nthey taught them to dig the ore from the earth, and how, by the\r\nagency of fire, to obtain the metal. Great was the joy in\r\nCornwall, and many days of feasting followed in consequence.\r\n\"Drunk as a Perraner\" has certainly passed into a proverb\r\nfrom that day.\r\n\r\nNot less wonderful than this legend is the discovery of tin-works\r\nby the agency of dreams. Carew, the Cornish historian,\r\nrecords with due solemnity the following: \"Somme,\" he says,\r\n\"have found tynne-works of great vallew through meanes no\r\nlesse strange and extraordinarie, to wit, by dreames. As in\r\nEdward the Sixt's tyme, a gentlewoman, heire to one\r\nTresculierd and wyfe to Lawyne, dreamed that a man of seemly\r\npersonage told her how in such a tenement of her lande, she\r\nshould finde so great store of tynne as would serve to enrich\r\nboth herself and her posteritie. This she revealed to her\r\nhusband, and hee putting the same in triall, found a worke\r\nwhich in foure years was worth him welneere so many\r\nthousand pounds. Moreover one Paprel, lately living and",
  "p1510.png": "dwelling in the parish of the hundred of West, called St. Niot,\r\nby a lyke dreame of his daughter (see the lucke of women),\r\nmade the like assay, met with the effect, farmed the worke of\r\nthe unwytting lord of the soyle, and grew thereby to good\r\nestate of wealth. The same report passeth as current touching\r\nsundrie others.\"\r\n\r\nAUBREY, in one of his letters, alludes to there being gold\r\nin this country; for which he offers three reasons:\r\nTacitus says there was gold in England, and that Agrippa came\r\nto a spot where he had a prospect of Ireland--from which\r\nplace he writes; secondly, that \"an honest man had at this\r\nspot found stones from which he had extracted good gold;\r\nand that he himself had seen in the broken stones a clear\r\nappearance of gold;\" and thirdly, \"there is a story which goes\r\nby tradition in that part of the country, that in the hill alluded\r\nto there was a door into a hole, that when any wanted money\r\nthey used to go and knock there, that a woman used to appear,\r\nand give to such as came. At a time, one, by greediness or\r\notherwise, gave her offence; she flung to the door, and\r\ndelivered this old saying, still remembered in the country:\r\n\r\n\"'When all the Daws be gone and dead,\r\nThen ---- Hill shall shine gold red.'\r\n\r\n[**add \" ?]My fancy is that this relates to an ancient family of the\r\nname, of which there is now none but one left, and he not\r\nlikely to have any issue.\"\r\n\r\nThese are his three reasons, and some mines have perhaps\r\nbeen opened with no better ones.",
  "p1520.png": "\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAMULETS[**comma, or mark on page?|P3 mark on page see Contents p.0070] AND TALISMANS.\r\n\r\nAmulets were so called by the Latins, from their supposed\r\nefficacy in allaying evil; \"amuletum quod\r\nmalum amolitur.\" Some derive the term from amula, a small\r\nvessel of lustral water, carried about by the Romans. The\r\npractice of such superstitions was universal, not only among\r\nthe Greeks and the Romans, but by the Egyptians and the\r\nOrientals. Amulets (alluded to in Isaiah iii. 20) were considered\r\nby the Jews as a protection from evil influences, and\r\nthe same belief in their efficacy exists to the present day in the\r\nEast. In Arabia, hamalet means that which is suspended.\r\nAny kind of object might be thus represented: a precious\r\nstone, a plant, an artificial production, or a piece of writing.\r\nThese were suspended from the neck, or tied to any part of the\r\nbody, for the purpose of warding off calamities, and securing\r\nsome specific object.\r\n\r\nFaith in the virtue of amulets was almost universal in ancient\r\ndays, so that the whole art of medicine consisted, in a very\r\nconsiderable degree, of directions for their application. The\r\nphylacteries, or bits of parchment, with passages from the\r\nBible written upon them, which the Jews were accustomed to\r\ncarry about them as amulets (Matthew xxiii. 5) were of the\r\nsame character as the sentences from the Koran, which the\r\nMoorish priests now sell to the negroes of Africa, as \"fetishes.\"[*]\r\n\r\n* The word Fetish is from the Portuguese feiti\u00e7o, an amulet, or talisman,\r\nand was applied by the early navigators of that nation to the objects they",
  "p1530.png": "They were of three kinds, and used for the head, the arm,\r\nand were also attached to door-posts. They were prepared in\r\na peculiar manner. A species of amulet at present in use\r\namong the natives, is a piece of paper upon which the names\r\nof the \"Seven Sleepers\" and their dog are inscribed.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times amulets consisted of tickets inscribed\r\nwith sacred sentences, and of certain precious stones and\r\nmetals. The earrings mentioned in Scripture (Isaiah iii. 20)\r\nwere probably jewels, or small pieces of gold and silver. It is\r\ncertain that these ornaments were used as instruments of superstition\r\n(Genesis xxxv. 4).\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest historians wrote concerning a deluge,\r\nwith strict attention to details, and with substantial agreement\r\nwith the Old Testament account of the universal deluge. So\r\ndid Berosus, who wrote his history of Babylon from documents\r\narchived in the temple of Bel, where he was a priest. So did\r\nalso Abydenus, who wrote on the affairs of the Medians and\r\nthe Assyrians. Both these historians flourished about three\r\ncenturies before Christ, and even so late as their time it was\r\nstill believed that fragments of the stranded Ark lay high up\r\n\r\nsaw held sacred among the negroes of the Gold Coast. They themselves\r\nprobably carried with them beads, crosses, or images, that had been blessed\r\nby their priests before they started on a voyage. With regard to the word,\r\nit is well known that the Portuguese feiti\u00e7o corresponds to Latin factitius.\r\nFactitius, from meaning what is made by hand, came to mean artificial,\r\nthen unnatural, magical, enchanted, and enchanting. The trade in feiti\u00e7\u00e6[**unclear]\r\nwas perfectly recognised in Europe during the middle ages, as it is still\r\namong the negroes of Africa. A manufacturer or seller of the amulets\r\nwas called feiti\u00e7ero, a word which, however, was likewise used in the sense\r\nof a magician, or conjuror.\r\n\r\n\"... In some parts of Africa, particularly where the influence of\r\nMohammedanism is felt, fetishes and sellers of fetishes are despised. The\r\npeople who believe in them are called Thiedos, or infidels. In other parts\r\nfetish-worship rules supreme, and priests, who manufacture fetishes and\r\nlive by the sale of them, shout very loudly, 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians.'\"--Max\r\nM\u00fcller, Hibbert Lectures, 1878.\r\n\r\n\"The negro fetishes,\" observes Southey, \"are just such objects as,\r\naccording to the French Jesuits, the devil used to present to the Canadian\r\nIndians, to bring them good luck in fishing, hunting, gaming, and such\r\ntraffic as they carried on. This may probably mean that they dreamt of\r\nsuch things; for in dreams many superstitions have originated, and great\r\nuse has been made of them in priestcraft.\"",
  "p1540.png": "among the snows of Ararat, and the Armenians used what they\r\ncould get of them as amulets.\r\n\r\nMany of the gems of the Egyptians were used as amulets\r\nby the Greeks and Romans (like the little silver crosses,\r\nMadonnas, and saints, which are the staple traffic in Catholic\r\ncountries), and such were also hung round the bodies of the\r\ndead. The most common variety was a stone, usually basalt,\r\nor porphyry, cut in the form of a scarab\u00e6us, a kind of beetle,\r\nwhose habit of gathering a ball of earth with the hind legs, and\r\ntherein depositing its eggs, caused it to be considered a fit\r\nemblem of the Divine Power, impregnating the world. In the\r\nBritish Museum there is a valuable collection of scarab\u00e6i and\r\nother amulets. Some are plain, but the greater number are\r\ncovered with inscriptions in hieroglyphics, some of which\r\ncontain the name of the wearer. Amulets in the shape of\r\nscarab\u00e6i were not confined to Egypt, but were used in many\r\nparts of the ancient world\r\n\r\nFrom a passage preserved in the Code of Justinian it appears\r\nthat coins were mounted in rich ornaments, and worn as\r\namulets. Gold was esteemed a powerful amulet by the\r\nRomans; thus infants and wounds were touched with it to\r\nprevent any evil spells affecting them. In later ages silver\r\nappears to have been the metal prescribed for setting all\r\namulets. Both Greeks and Romans employed coral necklaces,\r\nbeads, and figures of divinities, heroes, dogs, horses, birds,\r\nfishes, crowns of pearls, etc. These were not only worn on the\r\nperson, but hung on the jambs of doors, so that in opening\r\nthem, they made the phallus move and ring the bells attached\r\nto it.[*]\r\n\r\nThe Athlet\u00e6 wore amulets to ensure victory in the\r\ngladiatorial conflicts; they were suspended from the neck.\r\n\r\nThe two hard bones found just within the sides of the head\r\n\r\n* Arnot, in his \"History of Edinburgh,\" mentions that in all the old\r\nhouses then existing in Edinburgh, there were remains of cabalistic characters\r\nwhich the superstitions of earlier ages had caused to be engraven on their\r\nfronts, these were generally composed of texts of Scripture, of the name of\r\nGod, or an emblematic representation of the Resurrection.",

Even in the days of Belon, according to\r\nthat author, they were considered as infallible in preventing,\r\nand even curing, several maladies, especially colic; hence they\r\nwere best known by the name of colic-stones. In order to\r\nsecure the benefits of this panacea, it was believed that unless\r\nthey were received as a gift they had no effect. If purchased\r\nthey lost their medicinal virtues. This we can easily understand.\r\n\r\nSimilar superstitions appear to have prevailed among the\r\nearlier converts to Christianity; the general inscription on\r\nthese amulets being ichthys, the Greek word for a fish, because\r\nthe word contained the initials of Jesus Christ, Son of God,\r\nSaviour. These practices called for the denunciation of St.\r\nChrysostom, and other Fathers of the Church. The Council\r\nof Laodicea (A.D. 366) prohibited ecclesiastics from wearing\r\namulets and phylacteries, on pain of degradation, and in 721\r\nthey were solemnly condemned by the Church.\r\n\r\nAmulets were applied to the Holy Eucharist by the early\r\nChristians. From being carried on the breast they were often\r\ncalled \"encolpion\" or \"philasteria;\" sometimes they were in\r\nthe form of a medal of bronze, marked with a cross, and\r\nwith a hand, with the salutation, \"May'st thou live;\" a portion\r\nof the Gospels hung about the neck; a relic or a formulary\r\nwithin a box of precious wood, like one now preserved at\r\nMonza. Coins of Alexander were worn as amulets in the time\r\nof Chrysostom.\r\n\r\nThe European belief in amulets was, no doubt, an importation\r\nfrom the East. With the spread of Arabian astronomy the\r\nastrological amulet, or talisman of the Arabs, became generally\r\nknown. Among amulets in repute in the middle ages were the\r\ncoins attributed to St Helena, the mother of Constantine.\r\nThese and other coins, marked with a cross, were considered\r\nespecially efficacious in cases of epilepsy, and are generally",

The charms used by the Anglo-Saxons\r\nwere innumerable. They trusted in their magical incantations\r\nand amulets for the cure of disease, the success of\r\ntheir tillage, the discovery of lost property, and for the prevention\r\nof casualties. Specimens of such charms still remain to\r\nus. Bede says that \"Many in time of disease (neglecting the\r\nsacraments) went to the erring medicaments of idolatry, as if to\r\nrestrain God's chastisements by incantations, phylacteries, or\r\nany other secret of the demoniacal arts.\"\r\n\r\nThe inventor of magic \"runes\" in the North is said to have\r\nbeen Odin (most probably a mortal hero, who afterwards, from\r\nhis prowess, obtained divine honours), about the time of the\r\nChristian era. He is thence called \"Runhofdi,\" or \" Rune-*head,\"\r\naccording to some writers owing this appellation only to\r\nhis great skill in the runic characters. The runes made use\r\nof for magical purposes were known by the appellation of\r\nnoxious or bitter runes, and were employed to bring various\r\nevils on enemies. The favourable averted misfortunes; the\r\nvictorious procured conquests. The medicinal were inscribed\r\non leaves of trees for healing; others served to dispel melancholy\r\nthoughts, to prevent shipwrecks, or were antidotes to\r\npoison, and efficacious to render a mistress favourable. These\r\nlast were to be used with great caution. If an ignorant person\r\nhad chanced to write one letter for another, but erred in the\r\nminutest stroke, he would have exposed his mistress to some\r\ndangerous illness, which was only to be cured by writing other\r\nrunes with the greatest nicety.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, in his \"Personal Narratives,\" mentions the Jade-*stones\r\nas having been for ages an article of trade, as amulets,\r\namong the natives both of the north and the south side of the\r\nOrinoco.

Whilst a fit of\r\nhysteria was cured, one of epilepsy, in the predisposed, was said\r\nto be excited by its fumes. Serpents and demons were said to\r\nbe driven away by it, and the spells and incantations of magic\r\nentirely subdued. To amber beads, certain virtues or talismanic\r\nproperties were attached. Olaus Wormius, the learned professor\r\nof Copenhagen, alludes to the superstitious notions prevalent\r\nrespecting amber. In ancient sepulchral barrows, beads of this\r\nmaterial are frequently found; as also stone and bone amulets.\r\nIn opening a cromlech in Guernsey (1859) at L'Ancresse, Mr.\r\nLukis found amulets of serpentine, clay-slate, and lapis ollaris.\r\n\r\nA single bead of amethystine quartz is often seen in ancient\r\nbarrows, most probably worn as an amulet.\r\n\r\nGalen mentions an amulet belonging to an Egyptian king,\r\nwho is said to have lived 630 years before the Christian era. It\r\nwas composed of a green jasper, cut in the form of a dragon,\r\nand surrounded with rays. This was applied to strengthen the\r\nstomach and the organs of digestion.\r\n\r\nIn India the \"salagrama\" stone is supposed to possess extraordinary\r\nqualities. It is about the size of a billiard-ball, of\r\na black colour, and usually perforated as if by worms. It is\r\nbelieved to be found only in the Gandaki, a river in Nepaul,\r\nwhich, according to the followers of Vishnu, flows from the\r\nfoot of that deity; but according to the Saivas, from the head\r\nof Siva. The fortunate possessor of this stone preserves it in\r\na clean cloth, from which it is frequently taken, and bathed\r\nand perfumed. The water with which the ablution is performed\r\nacquires a sin-expelling potency, and it is therefore drunk and",

Shirley,\r\nEsq.), the following account is given of a curious substance:\r\n\"The Goa stone is an admirable preparation of various ingredients;\r\nit is made by a Jesuit at Goa; it hath the same effects\r\nwith the Lady Kent's powder, but is much stronger; it is a\r\nsudorificke, and expels all poisons and malignant humours in\r\nthe blood; it is admirable in all feavours and agues, and good\r\nto prevent them; it drives out mesels and small-pox; som\r\npersons doe eat a little of it every day, and doe scrape some of\r\nit in to drinke; it is a great cordiall.\"\r\n\r\nStones of various forms are employed as amulets by different\r\nnations. The Tasmanians, like the Australians, often wear a\r\nsuspended cylindrical stone. By the Rio Negro they wear\r\nround the neck a stone of quartz from four to eight inches long\r\nby one inch broad, having a hole made throughout; and which,\r\nwith their implements, was the work of many years. Mr.\r\nMarkham remarks of a tribe of the Amazon: \"A cylindrical\r\nwhite stone of quartz is invariably carried on the breast\r\nas a charm, suspended by a chain of black seeds.\" Such is the\r\npractice of the Australians, as it is of the women of India, and\r\nof the women of Southern Italy; in the case of the latter it is\r\nhorn-shaped.",
  "p1590.png": "\r\nThe amulets of the Tasmanians consist of sacred stones\r\nsuspended from the neck, to prevent witchcraft and a host of\r\nevils. A girdle of human hair, with the netted string from the\r\nroot of the bulrush, is also an efficacious charm. A jawbone,\r\nor skull, is a protection; the scrapings from a bone are\r\nespecially valuable; even the water in which the relics have\r\nbeen steeped have healing properties. A dried human skin,\r\nhaving the ears and also the finger-nails, healed sickness.\r\n\r\nAmong the traditions of the Icelanders is one in which two\r\nprominent characters, Bersi and Steinar, contest a swimming-match;\r\nthe latter perceiving that his competitor wore an\r\namulet, called a life-stone, round his neck, swam up to him, and\r\ntearing it off, threw it into the sea. It was, however, found at\r\nebb-tide by Thord, who being at enmity with Bersi, kept\r\npossession of it. Being informed of a dangerous wound\r\nreceived by the latter, Thord gave Bersi his amulet, which\r\neffected a perfect cure, and the two were reconciled to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the Javan mythology, a famous personage, who was\r\nsuperior in abilities to all other created beings, being grown up,\r\nwas sent by his father to do penance in the ocean, who gave\r\nhim at the same time a precious stone, fraught with the\r\nwonderful power of rendering its possessor insensible to hunger,\r\ncold, thirst, etc., and which completely fortified him against the\r\neffects of water, fire, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Panorama\" (vol. vii.) we find an instance of the\r\nloadstone being used as an amulet against the gout: \"Henry\r\nHinde Pelly, Esq., of Upton, in the county of Essex, wears\r\nconstantly a piece of loadstone, sewed in a little flannel case,\r\nsuspended by a black ribbon round his neck, next the skin. It\r\nis about two inches long, about an inch and a half broad, and\r\nof the thickness of two-tenths of an inch. Mr. Pelly, who is a\r\ngentleman advanced in years, says that he used to be laid up\r\nannually for three or four months with a violent fit of the gout.\r\nHe read in some old book that the wearing of a magnet next\r\nthe skin was a sure preservative.

The descendants\r\nof this worthy possess a magnet, or loadstone,\r\nwhich belonged to him; and the tradition in the family is that\r\nthe old admiral, before going to sea, used to touch his needle\r\nwith it. The stone is dark-coloured, and the precise geological\r\nformation is doubtful. The curious stone, with its armature of\r\niron, was probably a talisman.[*]\r\n\r\nThe unicorn's horn was considered an amulet of singular\r\nefficacy. It is now known that the object shown as such in\r\nvarious museums is the horn of the rhinoceros. They were\r\nsold at six thousand ducats, and were thought infallible tests\r\nof poison, just as Venetian glass and some sorts of jewels were.\r\nThe Dukes of Burgundy kept pieces of horn in their wine-jugs,\r\nand used others to touch all the meat they tasted.\r\n\r\nDrinking-cups of this kind were greatly esteemed in former\r\ntimes. In the inventory of jewels and plate in the Tower\r\n(1649), with cups and beakers of unicorn's horn, is entered,\r\n\"A rinoceras cupp, graven with figures, with a golden foot,\"\r\nvalued at \u00a312. Decker, in the \"Gul's Hornbook,\" speaks of\r\n\"the unicorn whose horn is worth a city.\"\r\n\r\nIn the National Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of\r\nScotland, in Section L, are some curious charms and amulets,\r\namong which may be mentioned (No. 182) a flat oblong stone,\r\nfour inches long, by two and three-quarters wide, and less than\r\na quarter of an inch in thickness, notched on the sides, and\r\npierced with two holes one and a half inch apart, formerly used\r\n\r\n* Bulenger in (De Ratione Divinationis) a chapter on Lithomancy shows,\r\nfrom Tzetzes, that Helenus ascertained the fall of Troy by the employment\r\nof a magnet; and that if a magnet be washed in spring water, and interrogated,\r\na voice like that of a sucking child will reply.\r\n\r\nThe Pseudo-Orpheus has related at length this story of Helenus.

A druggist in Texas lately paid 250\r\ndollars for a \"mad\" stone. The stone was found in the stomach of a deer\r\nseveral years ago, and is reputed to possess the virtue of curing the bites of\r\nmad dogs, snakes, and all other venomous animals and reptiles.\r\n\r\n* Bacon, in his \"Sylva Sylvarum,\" arguing on the effects of imagination,\r\nobserves: \"The operations of sympathy, brought by the writers of natural\r\nmagic into an art; which is in order to superinduce any virtue or disposition\r\nin a person, to choose the living creature, wherein that virtue is most\r\neminent; of this creature to take the parts wherein that virtue chiefly lies;\r\nand again to take these parts in that time and act, where and when the\r\nvirtue is most exercised, and then apply it to that part of a man wherein\r\nthe same virtue chiefly consists. Thus, for example, to superinduce courage,\r\ntake a lion, or a cock, and choose the heart, tooth, or paw of the lion;\r\ntake these parts immediately after the lion, or the cock, has been in fight\r\nand let them be worn upon a man's heart or wrist.\"\r\n\r\nWe must consider these remarks as a subject for inquiry only, as the\r\ngreat philosopher, fallible in many points, was not so superstitious as to\r\nbelieve what, probably, he merely suggests for examination.",

The Burmese sometimes insert pellets of\r\ngold under the skin with this view. At a meeting of the\r\nAsiatic Society, of Bengal, in 1868, gold and silver coins were\r\nshown, which had been extracted from under the skin of a\r\nBurmese convict, at the Andaman Islands. Friar Odoric\r\nspeaks of the practice in one of the Indian Islands (apparently\r\nBorneo), and the stones possessing such virtue were, according\r\nto him, found in the bamboo, presumably the silicious concretions\r\ncalled Tabashir. Conti also describes the practice in\r\nJava of inserting such amulets under the skin. The Malays of\r\nSumatra, too, have great faith in the efficacy of certain\r\n\"stones,\" which they pretend are extracted from reptiles, birds,\r\nanimals, etc., in preventing them from being wounded.\r\n\r\nAn amulet to secure victory in battle was in the museum of\r\nSir Ashton Lever, which had belonged to a king of Brak, in\r\nSenegal, who, however, had the misfortune to be killed in\r\nbattle with the charm upon him.

Pray to God through\r\nour Lord Mohammed. All that exists is so only by his\r\ncommand. He gives life and also calls sinners to account.\r\nHe deprives us of life by the sole power of his name; these are\r\nundeniable truths.

This amulet was afterwards transmitted to the\r\nViceroy Affonso d'Alboquerque, as a valuable present.\r\n\r\nBeowulf furnishes us with an apt illustration of the early\r\nTeuton belief in amulets: \"About the crest of the helm, the\r\ndefence of the head, it held an amulet fastened without with\r\nwires, that the sword, hardened with scouring, might not\r\nviolently injure him, when the shield-bearing warrior should go\r\namongst his foes.\" This fancy was handed down to later times,\r\nwhen a quartz-crystal obtained the name of blut-stein, and was\r\nsupposed to prevent effusion of blood. The Kormak Saga\r\nalso alludes to the amuletic \"life-stone.\"\r\n\r\nMarco Polo, alluding to the Tartar expedition to Zipanga\r\n(Japan), in 1269, relates that two Tartar chiefs took a number\r\nof prisoners in a castle, and because they had refused to surrender,\r\nordered their heads to be cut off; but there were eight\r\namong the condemned on whom the sentence could have no\r\neffect, because they wore consecrated stones, or amulets, in\r\ntheir arms between the skin and the flesh, \"which so enchanted\r\nthem that they could not die by steel.\" They were, therefore,\r\nbeaten to death by clubs, and \"the stones being extracted, were\r\nheld very precious.\"\r\n\r\nWe read in the old French Chronicles that Gondebaud, King\r\nof Burgundy, in the fifth century sought, as an amulet, the aid\r\nof St. Sergius's thumb, which being fastened to the right arm of\r\na certain king in the East, had made him always victorious, and\r\nnot succeeding in this, he, by force, obtained a piece of the\r\nsaint's finger.\r\n\r\nIn the Harleian Collection we find that Robert Tresillian,\r\nthe Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, who was condemned\r\nto death for treason, in 1386, \"when he came to the\r\nplace of execution would not climb the ladder until such time\r\nas being soundly beaten with bats and staves, he was forced to\r\ngo up, when he said, 'So long as I do wear anything upon me,\r\nI shall not die;' whereupon the executioner stripped him, and\r\nfound certain images painted like unto the signs of heaven, and",

Large quantities of\r\narsenic were imported into London for this purpose.

The powder of toad was\r\nemployed in a similar way. Pope Adrian is reported never to\r\nhave been without it.

It was generally bought in\r\nhalf-yards, and all the Roman Catholic children, boys and\r\ngirls, wore it round their necks. This was so general, and so\r\nremarkable, as to occasion some inquiry, and the reason given\r\nwas this: a priest had dreamt there would be a great plague\r\namong all the children of their Church, under fifteen years of\r\nage; that their brains were to boil out at the back of their heads.\r\nHe dreamt also that there was a charm to prevent it, which was,\r\nto get some red tape, have it blessed and sprinkled with holy\r\nwater, and tie it round the children's necks till the month of\r\nMay, when the season of danger would be past. The Protestants\r\nhad good cause to suspect that it was, in reality,\r\nintended as a mark to distinguish their own children, like the\r\nblood of the Paschal Lamb, when the Egyptian first-born were\r\nto be cut off.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Japan Daily Herald (November 26, 1877) is a\r\ncurious account of the use of amulets or charms: \"In order\r\nto escape cholera, the dogs in the Matsushima and neighbourhood,\r\nthe cats and birds in Horiye, the monkeys and bears in\r\nNambajinchi, the rabbits in the Temma Temple, and the deer\r\nin the Sakuranomiya Temple, are wearing charms.\"\r\n\r\nGUTIERREZ, a Spanish physician, who wrote a work on\r\n\"Fascination\" (1653), states that the children of that\r\ncountry wore amulets against the \"evil eye,\" somewhat\r\nresembling those in use among the Romans.

In fact, the amulet worn by",

As amulets against love-fascination, he\r\nrecommends sprinkling with the dust in which a mule has\r\nrolled itself; a bone which may be found in the right side of a\r\ntoad; or the liver of a chameleon.\r\n\r\nThe use of nuts, among other superstitions, as amulets against\r\nfascination, were employed by the inhabitants of the western\r\nislands of Scotland. Hobhouse, in his \"Travels,\" gives a\r\ncurious account of this practice in Turkey, among both\r\nMohammedans and Christians: \"When a child is born it is\r\nimmediately laid in the cradle and loaded with amulets, and\r\na small bit of soft mud, well steeped in a jar of water, properly\r\nprepared by previous charms, is stuck upon its forehead, to\r\n\r\n* \"The objects that are fastened up as means to keep off witchcraft,\"\r\nsays Plutarch, in a remarkable passage (\"Sympos.,\" v. 7), where he is\r\nattempting to explain everything by natural causes, \"derive their efficacy\r\nfrom the fact that they act through the strangeness and ridiculousness of\r\ntheir forms, which fix the mischief-working evil eye upon themselves.\"",

These are evidences of the prevalence in Ceylon of that\r\nmost ancient of all superstitions, the belief in the \"evil eye,\"\r\nwhich exists in every country in the universe, from China to\r\nPeru. The Greeks of the present day entertain the same\r\nhorror of it as their ancestors did; and the mal occhie of modern\r\nItaly is the traditional fascinatio of the Romans.

At Jablanica, in the valley of the\r\nNarenta, we heard of a Turk, who, a few days before had\r\nbroken his amulet ring. The poor man's terror was piteous to\r\nsee; and fearing that the injury to his charm portended that\r\nsome terrible misfortune would overtake him, or that, at least,\r\nhis hours were numbered, he immediately set out on a ten-hours'\r\njourney to Mostar, that the injury might be repaired by\r\ncunning artificers. And what is extremely curious, this belief\r\nin charms is not by any means confined to the Moslems of\r\nBosnia. The Christians are equally given to talismans, and I\r\nsaw some with crosses and inscriptions in Cyrillian characters.\"\r\nAmi Bou\u00e9 mentions Herzegovinian rayahs wearing about their\r\npersons texts written on scrolls of paper, in the same manner\r\nas verses of the Koran with the Moslems. The latter on their\r\npart return the compliment, and it is not the least curious trace\r\nof the lurking penchant for the faith of their fathers, betrayed\r\nby some of the descendants of the Bosnian renegades, that at\r\ntimes Mohammedans have been known to send their amulets\r\nto the Franciscan monks, that their blessing might lend an\r\nadditional potency to the charm. The scrolls containing verses\r\nfrom the Koran are a very favourite amulet here; sometimes\r\nthey are sewn into the dress, or hung round the neck, or\r\nattached to the arm.

In the \"Travels of\r\nMacarius\" we read that \"they neither regard the beauty of the\r\npainting nor the skill of the painter, for with them a beautiful\r\nor an ugly painting are all one, and they honour and bow to\r\nthem perpetually, though the picture be only a daub of children,\r\nor a sketch upon a leaf of paper; so that of a whole army there\r\nis not a single man but carries in his knapsack a gaudy picture\r\nwithin a simple cover, with which he never parts, and wherever\r\nhe halts he sets it up on a piece of wood and worships it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian Nonconformists (Raskolnics) are in the habit\r\nof carrying about with them in rings or amulets, parings of an\r\nowl's claws, and of their own nails.

The efficacy\r\nof these tied or knotted amulets depended to a great extent\r\nupon the magical force of their knots. To these knots frequent\r\nreference is made in the spells. Here is one, for instance, intended\r\nto guarantee its employer against all risk of being shot:\r\n\"I attach five knots to each hostile, infidel shooter, over arquebuses,\r\nbows, and all manner of warlike weapons.

Sometimes the\r\namulet is merely a knotted thread.

  "p1860.png": "\r\nTALISMAN (Arabic, but supposed to be derived from the\r\nGreek Telesma, in the sense of celebration of religious\r\nceremonies) was a species of charm consisting of a figure engraved\r\non metal or stone when two planets are in conjunction,\r\nor when a star is in its culminating point, and supposed to exert\r\nsome protective influence over the wearer of it. The terms\r\ntalisman and amulet are often considered synonymous, but the\r\nproper distinctive peculiarity of the former is its astrological\r\ncharacter. Fosbrooke, in his \"Encyclop\u00e6dia of Antiquities,\"\r\nhas arranged talismans into five divisions: 1. The astronomical,\r\nwith celestial signs and intelligible characters. 2. The magical,\r\nwith extraordinary figures, superstitious words, and names of\r\nunknown angels. 3. The mixed, of celestial signs and barbarous\r\nwords, but not superstitious, or with names of angels.\r\n4. The sigilla planetarium, composed of Hebrew numeral\r\nletters, used by astrologers and fortune-tellers. 5. Hebrew\r\nnames and characters. These were formed according to the\r\ncabalistic art.\r\n\r\nAmong the Egyptians, the image of Harpocrites, an astronomical\r\ndivinity, who seems to have personified the return of the\r\nsun at the winter solstice, and was represented in the form of\r\na young infant, was hung from the neck, or worn in a ring upon\r\nthe finger, as a talisman.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word for talisman (magan) signifies a paper or\r\nother material drawn or engraved with the letters composing\r\nthe sacred name Jehovah, or with other characters, and improperly\r\napplied to astrological representations, because, like the\r\nletters composing \"the incommunicable Name,\" they were\r\nsupposed to serve as a defence against sickness, lightning, and\r\ntempest. It was a common practice with magicians, in seasons\r\nof calamity, to make a supposed image of the destroyer, either\r\nin gold, silver, clay, wax, etc., under a certain configuration of\r\nthe heavens, and to set it up in some particular place that the\r\nevil might be stayed.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the talisman were positive; the astrological\r\nfigure of Mercury engraved upon silver, which is the correspond-*",

A sponge saturated therewith was sometimes\r\nworn as a sacred relic, and it may be as a supernatural amulet,\r\nby their friends and relatives. Prudentius describes the spectators\r\nof the martyrdom of St. Vincent as dipping their clothes\r\nin his blood, that they might keep it as a sort of palladium for\r\nsuccessive generations.\r\n\r\n\"Crowds haste the linen vest to stain\r\nWith gore distill'd from martyr's vein,\r\nAnd thus a holy safeguard place\r\nAt home, to shield a future race.\"\r\n\r\nThe mere contact with the brandea, or handkerchief from the\r\nmartyr's tomb, the filings of his chains, or the oil from the lamp\r\nbefore his shrine, communicated spiritual as well as physical\r\nbenefit. These sacred relics possessed a talismanic power to\r\nprotect from evil. They were borne into battle to avert death,\r\nand to blunt the edge of the sword. They were affixed to\r\ntowers as a safeguard against the thunderbolt. They were\r\ninlaid in the crowns and regalia of kings, and worn as amulets\r\nagainst poison and disease.\r\n\r\nAmong the various objects found in the catacombs of Rome",
  "p1880.png": "were small caskets of gold or other metal for containing a portion\r\nof the Gospels, generally part of the first chapter of John,\r\nwhich were worn on the neck. They seem to have been introduced\r\nin the decline of primitive piety, in imitation of the\r\nJewish phylactery or pagan amulet, and were probably worn for\r\nthe same superstitious purpose, to avert danger, or to cure disease.\r\nThey were condemned by Iren\u00e6us, Augustine, Chrysostom,\r\nand by the Council of Laodicea, as a relic of heathenism.\r\nOn the carved figure of a fish, with a hole drilled through for\r\nsuspending it from the neck, and probably intended as an amulet,\r\nis engraved in Greek, \"Mayst thou save us.\"\r\n\r\nIn a sermon of St. Eloy (circa 640) he says: \"Let none presume\r\nto hang amulets on the neck of man or beast; even though\r\nthey be made by the clergy, and called holy things, and contain\r\nthe words of Scripture, for they are fraught, not with the remedy\r\nof Christ, but with the poison of the Devil.\"\r\n\r\nMr. O. Morgan, late Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries,\r\nexhibited at a meeting of the Society (May 21, 1857), a\r\nsilver disc of the seventeenth century, inscribed with talismanic\r\ncharacters. It is about two inches in diameter. On one side,\r\nin the centre, is a group of cabalistic astrological characters,\r\nand among them are the symbols of Venus, the Moon, and\r\nLibra. Around these run the following inscription, partly in\r\nLatin and partly in English, in three lines: \"Accipe mihi petitionem,\r\nO Domine. Keep me as the apple of an eye; hide\r\nme under the shadow of thy wings from all evel. Up, Lord,\r\nand help us, for thou art my strong rock and my castle.\r\nAmen.\" On the other side is rudely engraved in the centre,\r\nthe table magic square of forty-nine smaller squares, each filled\r\nwith Hebrew figures, which just corresponds with the square\r\ngiven in the engraving of an amulet of Venus in Reichelt's\r\nwork. At the top is a hole for its suspension, on one side of\r\nwhich, in common figures, is the number 1225. This may be\r\ncalled the mystic number of the amulet, for all these amulets\r\nseem to have been made with curious and ingenious calculations\r\nand computations according to the numerical value of the",
  "p1890.png": "Hebrew letters, each letter having a peculiar numerical value.\r\nIn this, each of the seven lines of the square, when added up,\r\nmake the total 175, and the seven sums of 175, when added\r\ntogether, make the grand total of 1225, which is therefore the\r\nentire value of the whole square. On the other side of the\r\nsuspension-hole is engraved in Hebrew the Tetragrammaton, or\r\nineffable name of God. On the right side of the square is\r\nengraved the Hebrew name of the planet Venus, which signifies\r\nmighty and beautiful. The characters which form this word\r\nhave a numerical value of 139. At the bottom and on the\r\nother side are other Hebrew letters, having a numerical value\r\nof the number of the planets.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan judges from the metal of which this talisman is\r\nmade, and the astrological characters engraved on it, that it\r\nmay be considered a talisman of Venus, made under the influence\r\nof the Moon and Libra, whilst the other mystic characters\r\nindicate an invocation of good from the combination of\r\nthose heavenly bodies, and the Hebrew inscription may convey\r\na prayer, that by the power of God, the planet Venus may,\r\nunder the influence of all the planets, be favourable to the\r\npetition engraved on the amulet, and propitious to the wearer.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary belief in astrology and talismans prevailed\r\nin Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but\r\nespecially during the period from 1550 to 1650. The talismans\r\nof that time were usually made under the special influence\r\neither of the constellation, the fixed stars, or the planets. Those\r\nmade under the influence and, as it was termed, in the Seal of\r\nthe Planets (and they were sometimes called Seals of the\r\nPlanets) were either made under the influence of them altogether,\r\nof one single planet, or of two or more combined. They\r\nwere made of the metals, each of the seven planets. The\r\nsymbol, therefore, of the planet became also the symbol of the\r\nmetal; thus there was a close connection between astrology\r\nand alchemy. The metals employed were all purified and\r\nused in a particular manner, and also at particular seasons.\r\nThey were usually formed into circular or multangular plates or",
  "p1900.png": "lamin\u00e6, and were engraved with the necessary mystic characters.\r\n\r\nThe pentalpha, pentacle, or pentangle, consisting of three\r\ntriangles intersected, has always had mysterious talismanic\r\npowers ascribed to it. Aubrey says the pentacle was \"heretofore\r\nused by the Greek Christians (as the sign of the cross is\r\nnow) at the beginning of letters or books, for good-luck's sake.\r\nThe Jews informed Dr. Bathurst \"that the women did make\r\nthis mark on their chrysome clothes.\" Rennet, Bishop of\r\nPeterborough (Lansdowne MS. 231), says: \"The figure of\r\nthree triangles intersected and made of five lines, is called the\r\nPentangle of Solomon, and when it is delineated on the body\r\nof a man, it is pretended to touch and point out the five places\r\nwherein the Saviour was wounded, and therefore the devils\r\nwere afraid of it. It is the druden fus of the German writers\r\non magic, and is still regarded in Germany as a talisman\r\nagainst the power of witches, and is said to have its origin in\r\nthe doctrines of Pythagoras, and thence transferred to Druidism.\r\nG\u00f6the makes Faust avail himself of its influence; and John\r\nEvelyn, in many of his books, after inserting his name in\r\nmonogram, was wont with the pen to draw the pentacle\r\nbetween the words \"Dominus providebit.\"\r\n\r\nThe pentacle of Solomon was looked upon in the middle\r\nages as a sign of immense power, and it is worthy of remark\r\nthat at the present time the magical pentalpha in the western\r\nwindow of the southern aisle of Westminister[**typo: Westminster] Abbey, is one of\r\nthe emblems which still exist, and tell to the initiated that the\r\nblack monks who once chanted in the choir were deeply read\r\nin occult science.\r\n\r\nBarrett, in his \"Magus,\" says: \"It is always necessary to\r\nhave this pentacle in readiness to bind with, in case the spirits\r\nshould refuse to be obedient, as they can have no power over\r\nthe exorcist while provided with and fortified by the pentacle,\r\nthe virtue of the holy names therein written presiding with\r\nwonderful influence over the spirits.

It was a\r\nsapphire, and it contained a hand alive, which grasped a small\r\nserpent, also alive. Through the bright gem both were\r\nvisible, the hand, and the 'worm,' as they called it. When\r\ninvoked by the king, the fingers moved and the serpent writhed,\r\nand miracles were wrought by spirits who were vassals of the\r\ngem. Because of this mystic hand, the pentacle, or five-pointed\r\n(fingered) figure, became the sigil of signomancy in the\r\nearly ages.\r\n\r\nScott, in \"Marmion,\" describing the wizard in the Host's\r\nTale, says:\r\n\r\n\"His shoes were marked with cross and spell,\r\nUpon his breast a pentacle.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Emperor Napoleon III., when Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon, was stated to be in possession of the talisman of\r\nCharlemagne, to which allusion is frequently made in traditionary\r\nhistory. This curious object of vertu is mentioned in\r\nthe Parisian journals as la plus belle relique de l'Europe, and it\r\nhas certainly excited considerable interest in the arch\u00e6ological\r\nand religious circles on the Continent. The talisman is of fine\r\ngold, of a round form, set with gems, and in the centre are two\r\nrough sapphires and a portion of the Holy Cross; besides other\r\nrelics brought from the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThis was found round the neck of Charlemagne on the opening\r\nof his tomb, and given by the town of Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle)\r\nto Bonaparte, and by him to his favourite Hortense,\r\nci-devant Queen of Holland, at whose death it descended to\r\nher son Prince Louis, the late Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have a curious legend connected with this\r\ntalisman. It was framed by some of the magi in the train of\r\nthe ambassadors of Aaroun-al-Raschid to the mighty Emperor",
  "p1920.png": "of the West, at the instance of his spouse Fastrada, with the\r\nvirtue that her husband would be always fascinated towards the\r\nperson or thing on which it was. The constant love of Charles\r\nto this his spouse was the consequence; but as it was not taken\r\nfrom her finger after death, the affection of the emperor was\r\ncontinued unchanging to the corpse, which he would on\r\nno account allow to be interred, even when it became\r\noffensive. His confessor, having some knowledge of the\r\noccult sciences, at last drew off the amulet from the inanimate\r\nbody, which was then permitted to be buried; but he retained\r\npossession of it himself, and thence became Charles's chief\r\nfavourite and prime minister, till he had been promoted to the\r\nhighest ecclesiastical dignity, as Archbishop of Mainz and\r\nChancellor of the Empire. At this pitch of power, whether he\r\nthought he could rise no higher, or scruples of conscience\r\nwere awakened by the hierarchical vows, he would hold the\r\nheathen charm no longer, and he threw it into a lake not far\r\nfrom his metropolitan seat, where the town of Aachen now\r\nstands. The regard and affection of the monarch were\r\nimmediately diverted from the monk and all men, to the\r\ncountry surrounding the lake; and he determined on building\r\nthere a magnificent palace for his constant residence, and\r\nrobbed all the ancient and imperial residences, even to the\r\ndistance of Ravenna, in Italy, to adorn it. Here he subsequently\r\nresided and died; but it seems the charm had a passive as\r\nwell as an active power; his throes of death were long and\r\nviolent; and though dissolution seemed every moment impending,\r\nstill he lingered in ceaseless agony, until the archbishop,\r\nwho was called to his bedside to administer the last\r\nsacred rites, perceiving the cause, had the lake dragged, and\r\nobtaining the talisman, he restored it to the person of the dying\r\nmonarch, when his struggling soul parted quietly away. The\r\ngrave was opened by Otto III. in 997, and possibly the town\r\nof Aachen may have been thought the proper depository.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the strange and absurd credulities respecting\r\namulets and talismans in past times; but superstitions",
  "p1930.png": "equally ridiculous still prevail at the present time; thus we\r\nhave a most extraordinary talisman revealed in the case of a\r\nburglar. I give the account in the words of Mr. James Greenwood,\r\na writer who has studied closely the peculiarities of the\r\nlower strata of society, especially those of the criminal classes.\r\nHe remarks (in the Graphic, June 14, 1879) that--\"Quite\r\nrecently, and by accident, there was discovered at a house in\r\nthe Mile End Road, London, several van-loads of valuable\r\narticles, one and all of which are suspected of being of\r\nburglarious origin. The person holding the premises, as was\r\nna\u00efvely admitted by the police, was not regarded as a man of\r\nunimpeachable character. For the last twelve years the constables\r\nof the locality had an eye on him, but he was too shrewd\r\nfor them.  It was not easy to reconcile this statement with\r\nour unquestioning faith in the efficiency of the metropolitan\r\npolice. Read, however, by the light of a revelation made a\r\nfew days ago at the Bow Street Police Office, it is all made\r\nplain enough. Policemen, despite stripes, buttons, and b\u00e2tons,\r\nare, after all, but human, and consequently no match for the\r\nmachinations of the master of mischief. It appears that every\r\nburglar who carries in his pocket a bit of charmed coal may defy\r\nthe authorities. How the peculiar sort is obtained--for it can\r\nhardly be supposed that any ordinary 'nobble' from the coal-vase\r\nwill answer the purpose--has not at present been made\r\npublic. All we know is that the professional burglar invariably\r\ncarries in his pocket a small lump of coal 'for luck.' The\r\nfact is vouched for by an experienced detective attached to the\r\nCriminal Investigation Department. He (the officer in question)\r\ndiscovered the tell-tale on the person of an individual\r\nsuspected of burglarious designs, and that, coupled with the\r\nfact that the midnight prowler carried a sack and a crowbar,\r\nmade it quite clear to the constable's mind that it was proper\r\nto arrest him, in order that he might give some account of\r\nhimself. 'For what purpose is the piece of coal used?' asked\r\nthe magistrate.  'They carry it to bring them luck--they all do\r\nit,' replied the officer. For luck generally, it may be assumed.",
  "p1940.png": "For a handsome 'swag' from the job they are about to engage\r\nin; for an easy and profitable quittance of the same; and last,\r\nthough by no means least, for the good luck of escaping\r\ndetection on the part of their natural enemy, the policeman.\r\nIn what way the mystic properties of the morsel of combustible\r\nmineral demonstrates its wonderful powers is not told. Perhaps,\r\nas was the ancient belief as regards fern-seed, it renders\r\nthose possessed with it invisible. Anyhow it is exceedingly\r\ngratifying that the important discovery has been made. Mr.\r\nPeace no doubt carried a piece of coal in his pocket, and being\r\na robber of the first order, he may perhaps have been favoured\r\nwith a lump of special potency. It may be said that since\r\naccording to the police-officer's testimony, all those who\r\nengage in this particular branch of predatory commerce, pin\r\ntheir faith to the safeguard in question, that if it possesses the\r\nvirtues claimed for it, the wonder should be, not that so many\r\nburglars escape, but that any should be taken. Possibly, however,\r\ncould one but sift the mystery to the bottom, the\r\nexplanation is simple enough. A robber may grow careless\r\nand mislay or lose his coal, or, made reckless by a long season\r\nof success, he may leave the precious talisman at home at the\r\nvery time he is most in need of it. Indeed, this view of the\r\nmatter is justified by the fact, that to the knowledge of the\r\ncourt, a burglar was never before taken, and a bit of coal found\r\non him. The accused man in the present instance may have\r\nbeen imposed on, and had a counterfeit charm put off on him.\r\nPerhaps it is only the genuine Wallsend sort of coal that will\r\nserve.

Many are the legends\r\nand superstitions on the wonderful effects produced by these\r\npotent charms. The ring of the High Priest of the Jews\r\npossessed celestial virtues; that of Solomon conferred upon\r\nhim divine powers by which he acquired universal knowledge,\r\nand triumphed over all obstacles. The wedding-ring of Joseph\r\nand the Virgin Mary was for ages an object of adoration; the\r\nmiracles performed by it are related in a book published at the\r\ncommencement of the seventeenth century, \"De Annulo Pronubo\r\nDeipare Virginis:\" autore, J. Bapt. Lamo (Colon, 1626).\r\nThis nuptial ring is shown in the cathedral of Perugia as its\r\ngreatest treasure, but it seems that other places claim a similar\r\nprivilege. This particular ring is, however, described as a plain\r\ngold circlet, large enough, apparently, for any man's thumb,\r\nand about six times as thick as any ordinary marriage-ring.\r\n\r\nLegends connected with rings were introduced into Greece\r\nfrom Asia, though the classical derivation ascribes the invention\r\nof the ring to Prometheus, who was condemned by Jupiter to",

A ring, with a similar gift, was presented to\r\nOtnet, King of Lombardy, by the queen-mother, when he went\r\nto gain in marriage the Soldan's daughter; and it had another\r\ninvaluable virtue of directing the wearer the right road to take\r\nin travelling. We may add, en passant, that fern-seed was supposed\r\nto confer invisibility; thus Fletcher, in his \"Maid of the\r\nInn,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"Had you Gyges' ring,\r\nOr the herb that gives invisibility?\"\r\n\r\nASTROLOGICAL RINGS in connection with mythological\r\nrepresentations were worn by the ancients. The\r\ntalismanic rings of the Samothracians, according to Artemidorus,\r\nwere of iron, and bore characters of the constellations. Petronius,\r\nalluding to the rings worn by Trimalcion, says: \"That\r\nwhich he had on his little finger was of gold, sprinkled with\r\niron stars.\"\r\n\r\nPlanetary rings were formed of the gems assigned to the\r\nseveral planets, each set in its appropriate metal; thus, the\r\nSun, diamond or sapphire in a ring of gold; the Moon, crystal\r\nin silver; Mercury, magnet in quicksilver; Venus, amethyst in\r\n\r\n* Of this ring it is judiciously observed in the Tatler (No. 138): \"How\r\nmight a man furnished with Gyges' secret, employ it in bringing together\r\ndistant friends; laying snares for creating good-will in the room of groundless[**hyphen assumed]\r\nhatred; in removing the fangs of an unjust jealousy; the shyness of an\r\nimperfect reconciliation; and the tremor of an awful love. Such a one\r\ncould give confidence to bashful merit, and confusion to overbearing\r\nimpudence.\r\n\r\n\"Certain it is that secret kindnesses done to mankind are as beautiful\r\nas secret injuries are detestable. To be invisibly good is as godlike, as to\r\nbe invisibly ill, diabolical.\"",

Pliny states that all the\r\nOrientals preferred the emerald jasper, and considered it an infallible\r\npanacea. Its power was strengthened when combined\r\nwith silver instead of gold. Galen recommends a ring with\r\njasper set in it, and engraved with the figure of a man wearing\r\na bunch of herbs round his neck. Apollonius of Tyana, in\r\nCappadocia, who flourished in the first age of the Christian era,\r\nand who fixed his residence in the temple of \u00c6sculapius, considered\r\nthe use of charmed rings so essential to quackery, that\r\nhe wore a different ring on each day of the week, marked with\r\nthe planet of the day. He had received a present of the seven\r\nrings from Jarchus, the Indian philosopher. It appears from\r\nthe legend that Jarchus was deeply versed in the occult sciences,\r\nand was a magician of such power that he is said to have constructed\r\na gold chair for himself, in which he could elevate his\r\nbody to the highest sphere, and hold converse with the planets.\r\nIn one of these excursions he received from a spirit seven\r\nrings of talismanic properties. The first displayed a diamond,\r\ndenoting brilliancy of mind and purity of heart. The second,\r\na ruby, expressive of the warm glow of benevolence. The\r\nthird, an emerald, emblem of eternal spring. The fourth, a\r\nsapphire, testifying truth, being the tints of the heavens. The\r\nfifth, a topaz, betokening caution and sagacity. The sixth, a\r\nchrysolite, depicting a mind receiving its colours from the influence\r\nof the times and seasons. The seventh, an amethyst,\r\nemblem of piety and dignity. These rings Jarchus was commanded\r\nto take to earth, and by bestowing them on the most\r\nworthy, thus disseminate the seeds of virtue among mankind.[*]\r\n\r\n* The \"Navigium\" of Eustathius contains some curious allusions to\r\ndifferent points of popular belief. One of the parties wishes for a set of\r\nrings to endow him with the following qualities and advantages: a never-failing\r\nstore of health; a person invulnerable, invisible, of irresistible\r\ncharms, and having the concentrated strength of ten thousand men; a\r\npower of flying through the air; of entering every dwelling-house, even",
  "p1980.png": "\r\nColonel Tod (author of \"The Annals and Antiquities of\r\nRajast-han), mentions a remarkable gold ring, of Hindu fabrication,\r\nfound on the Fort Hill, near Montrose, in Scotland, a\r\nfew years ago, on the site of an engagement in the reign of\r\nMary, Queen of Scots. This mystic amulet has at once an\r\nastrological and mythological import. It represents the symbol\r\nof the sun-god Bal-nat'h, around which is wreathed a serpent\r\nguardant, with two bulls as supporters; or the powers of\r\ncreative nature in unison, typified in the miniature Lingam and\r\nNoni--in short, a graven image of that primeval worship which\r\nprevailed among the nations of antiquity. This is \"the pillar\r\nand the calf,\" worshipped on the 15th of the month (the sacred\r\nAmavus of the Hindus) by the Israelites, when they adopted\r\nthe rites of the Syro-Ph\u0153nician adorers of Bal, the sun. This,\r\nthe pillar of Belenus (whose rites were introduced by those\r\nearly navigators into Gaul and Britain), to whom were raised\r\nthose rude unchiselled columns scattered over Europe,\r\nwherever the Celtic name was known.\r\n\r\nIn Hindu mythology, the bull, Nanda, is at once the guardian\r\nof one of the two gates of the heaven of Iswara, or Bal-Siva\r\nand his steed. The astronomic allusion thus blended\r\nwith mythology is evident, i.e., the entrance of the sun into the\r\nsign Taurus, the equinoctial festival of remote antiquity, and\r\nregarded as a jubilee by the Indo-Scythic nations hemming\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is imagined that the relic belonged to some pious devotee,\r\nwho wore it as a talisman on his thumb. The figures of the\r\nbulls have the hump on the shoulder, which characterises the\r\nkine within the Indus.\r\n\r\nif strongly secured; and of casting a deep sleep on whom he chooses.\r\nBacon, remarking on the effects of imagination, says: \"If a man wear a\r\nplanet-seal, or a bone-ring, believing strongly that it will help him to\r\nobtain his mistress, preserve him unhurt in fight, or the like, it may make\r\nhim more active and industrious, more confident and persisting, than otherwise\r\nhe would be.\r\n\r\n\"If a man believe in astrology, and find a figure prosperous, or believe\r\nin natural magic--as that a ring worn with such a stone will do good--this\r\nmay help his imagination.\"",
  "p1990.png": "\r\nIt was a belief among the Poles that each month of the year\r\nwas under the influence of precious stones. These were set in\r\nrings and trinkets.\r\n\r\nAmong the arts of divination practised in old times, those\r\nwith rings were numerous. They were performed in\r\ndifferent ways. One method was to suspend the ring (a wedding\r\none being generally preferred) by a thread or a hair, either\r\nwithin a glass tumbler, or within reach of it by swinging, and it\r\nstruck the glass--once for \"yes,\" twice for \"no,\" etc., as previously\r\ndetermined. Suspended over a gold coin it indicated certain\r\npersons among those sitting round the table, and if a hair was\r\nused taken from one of the company, it swung towards that\r\nindividual only. Another mode of practising dactylomancy\r\nwas putting rings on the finger nails when the sun entered Leo,\r\nand the moon Gemini; or the Sun and Mercury were in\r\nGemini, and the moon in Cancer, etc. These rings were made\r\nof gold, silver, copper, iron, or lead, and magical characters\r\nwere attached to them, but how they operated we are not\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\nAbout 372-373, an imperial decree was issued by Valentinian\r\nand Valens against the practisers of magical arts, or\r\npossessors even of magical books. Persecutions were carried\r\non, particularly at Antioch, where it had been provoked by the\r\ndetection of a treasonable act of divination. The twenty-four\r\nletters of the alphabet were ranged at intervals round the rim\r\nof a kind of charger, which was placed on a tripod, consecrated\r\nby magic songs and frequent ceremonies. The diviner, habited\r\nas a heathen priest, in linen robes, sandals, and with a fillet\r\nwreathed about his head, chaunted a hymn to Apollo, the god\r\nof prophecy; while a ring in the centre of the charger was\r\nslipped rapidly round a slender thread. The letters in front of\r\nwhich the ring stopped indicated the character of the oracle.\r\nThe ring on this occasion was supposed to have pointed to the\r\nfirst four letters in the name of the future emperor, \u0398\u0395\u039f\u0394.",
  "p2000.png": "Theodorus, and probably many others who had the misfortune\r\nto own the fatal syllables, were executed.[*]\r\n\r\nBaring Gould observes: \"I remember having been much\r\nperplexed by reading a series of experiments made with a pendulous\r\nring over metals, by a Mr. Mayo; he ascertained that\r\nit oscillated in various directions under peculiar circumstances,\r\nwhen suspended by a thread over the ball of the thumb. I\r\ninstituted a series of experiments, and was surprised to find the\r\nring vibrate in an unaccountable manner in opposite directions\r\nover different metals. On consideration, I closed my eyes\r\nwhilst the ring was oscillating over gold, and on opening them\r\nI found it had become stationary. I got a friend to change the\r\nmetals while I was blindfolded--the ring no longer vibrated.\r\nI was thus enabled to judge of the involuntary action of\r\nmuscles, quite sufficient to have deceived an eminent medical\r\nman like Mr. Mayo, and to have perplexed me until I succeeded\r\nin solving the mystery.\"\r\n\r\nRINGS formerly constituted the principal means for the prevention\r\nor cure of cramp. They were of various kinds,\r\nand were sometimes considered more efficacious if formed out\r\nof the screws or nails taken from coffins.[*] Andrew Boorde,\r\n\r\n* Rings have also formed the subject of omens good or unlucky.\r\nPlutarch relates that a contention having arisen among the officers of\r\nTimoleon, on the eve of a battle, Timoleon settled the controversy by lot,\r\nand taking a ring from each of the disputants, he cast them into his own\r\nrobe, and having shaken them together, the first he drew out and exposed\r\nto view had, by good fortune, the figure of a trophy engraved upon it,\r\nwhich, when the younger captains saw, they shouted with joy at the good\r\nomen, and, without waiting any longer to see how chance would determine\r\nit for the rest, they pressed forward and gained the victory.\r\n\r\n* The rings and screws of coffins have been supposed to possess certain\r\nvirtues from the time of Pliny to our own. He tells us that \"prodest pr\u0153fixisse\r\nin limine \u00e8 sepulchre avulsos clavos adversus nocturnas lymphationes.\"\r\nBacon observes, \"There are two things in use to prevent the cramp, viz., ring,\r\nof sea-horse teeth, worn upon the fingers, and fillets of green periwinkle,\r\ntied about the calf of the leg, the thigh, etc., where the cramp usually\r\ncomes. This seems the more strange, because neither of them has any\r\nrelaxing virtue, but rather the contrary; whence they appear to operate\r\nrather upon the spirits in the nerves, than upon the substance in the nerves\r\nthemselves.\"",
  "p2010.png": "who lived in the time of Henry VIII., alluding to the cramp,\r\nsays: \"The Kynge's Majestie hath a great helpe in this matter\r\nin hallowynge crampe rynges, and so given without money or\r\npetition.\" Also, \"The Kynges of Englande doth halowe every\r\nyere cramp rynges, ye which rynges worne on one's fynger doth\r\nhelpe them whych hath the crampe.\" This ceremonial was\r\npractised by previous sovereigns, and discontinued by Edward\r\nVI. Queen Mary intended to revive it. At a meeting of the\r\nArch\u00e6ological Institute (June 6, 1851), a manuscript was exhibited,\r\nbelonging to the late Cardinal Wiseman, containing\r\nboth the ceremony for the blessing of the cramp-rings, and that\r\nfor the touching for the king's evil. At the commencement of the\r\nmanuscript are emblazoned the arms of Philip and Mary. The\r\nfirst ceremony is headed \"Certain prayers to be used by the\r\nQuene's Heighnes in the consecration of the Crampe-rynges.\"\r\nAccompanying it is an illumination, representing the queen\r\nkneeling, with a dish containing the rings to be blessed on each\r\nside of her. Mr. Edmund Waterton thinks that this manuscript\r\nis the same from which Bishop Burnet printed the formula\r\nused at this ceremony. In Pegge's \"Curialia Miscellanea\" is\r\nalso the form of prayer and consecration. After a psalm, the\r\nsovereign reads a prayer for the communication of the divine\r\ngift of healing; after which a prayer is said over the rings\r\nlying in one basin or more: \"O God, the Maker of heavenly\r\nand earthly creatures, and the most gracious Restorer of mankind,\r\nthe Dispenser of spiritual grace, and the Origin of all\r\nblessings; send down from Heaven thy Holy Spirit the Comforter\r\nupon these rings artificially framed by the workmen, and\r\nby Thy great power, purify them so that all the malice of the\r\nfowle and venomous Serpent be driven out: and so the metal,\r\nwhich by Thee was created, may remain pure and free from all\r\ndregs of the enemy, through Christ our Lord.\"\r\n\r\nAnother form of prayer for the blessing of the rings is as\r\nfollows: \"O God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob,\r\nhear mercifully our prayers. Spare those who feare Thee. Be\r\npropitious to Thy suppliants, and graciously be pleased to send",
  "p2020.png": "down from Heaven Thy holy Angel, that he may sanctify and\r\nbless these rings, to the end that they may prove a healthy\r\nremedy to such as implore Thy name with humility,\" etc.\r\nAfter the blessing and other prayers, \"the King's Highnes\r\nrubbeth the rings between his hands, saying: 'Sanctify, O\r\nLord, these rings, and graciously bedew them with the dew of\r\nThy benediction, and consecrate them by the rubbing of our\r\nhands, which Thou hast been pleased, according to our ministry,\r\nto sanctify by an external effusion of holy oil upon them, to the\r\nend that what the nature of the metal is not able to perform,\r\nmay be wrought by the greatness of Thy grace.'\" Then must\r\nholy water be cast on the rings, saying: \"In the name of the\r\nFather, the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nMEDICATED RINGS were in great request by the\r\nempirics of old for the cure of diseases, and the practice\r\nwas common among the medical professors of the middle\r\nand lower Roman Empire. Marcellus, a physician who lived in\r\nthe reign of Marcus Aurelius, directs the patient who is afflicted\r\nwith a pain in the side, to wear a ring of pure gold, inscribed\r\nwith some Greek letters, on a Thursday, at the decrease of the\r\nmoon. It was to be worn on the right hand if the pain was on\r\nthe left side, and vice vers\u00e2. Trallian, another physician, living\r\nin the fourth century, cured the colic and all bilious complaints\r\nby means of an octangular ring of iron, on which eight words\r\nwere to be engraved, commanding the bile to enter the body\r\nof a lark! A magic diagram was to be added. He tells us\r\nthat he had great experience in the remedy. He recommends\r\nalso a cure for the stone by wearing a copper ring with the\r\nfigure of a lion, a crescent, and a star, to be placed on the\r\nfourth finger; and for the colic in general a ring with Hercules\r\nstrangling the Nem\u00e6an lion.\r\n\r\nRings on which the names of the Three Kings of Cologne\r\nwere inscribed, were considered in olden times exceedingly\r\nefficacious in the cure of various disorders: one, in the Londes-*",
  "p2030.png": "*borough collection has, in addition to the names, the inscription:\r\n\"in. God. is. a. r.,\" probably implying \"God is a remedy.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Oswald Cockayne's \"Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and\r\nStarcraft of Early England,\" we find a gold ring thus associated\r\nwith the cure of sore eyes: \"Knotgrass (Polygonum Aviculare)....\r\nFor sore of eyes, before sunrise, or shortly after it begins\r\nfully to set, go to the same wort proserpin\u00e6, and scratch it round\r\nabout with a golden ring, and say that thou wilt take it for leechdom\r\nof eyes; and after three days go again thereto before rising\r\nof sun, and take it, and hang it about the man's severe (neck);\r\nit will profit well.\"\r\n\r\nSuperstitions connected with supposed cures of epilepsy, etc.,\r\nby charmed rings, exist in various parts of the country at the\r\npresent day. In the West country, a young woman subject to\r\nfits was seen to wear a broad silver ring on her wedding finger.\r\nIt was made of a half-crown, got in exchange for thirty pence,\r\nbegged of thirty young men of her own age.\r\n\r\nIn the South of England a young man who had epileptic\r\nseizures was recommended to try a ring made of twenty sixpences\r\ncollected from maidens, not necessarily of his own age.\r\nHe has outlived the fits, and attributes it to the magic power of\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt relates a case of a paralysed woman in Cornwall,\r\nabout fifty years of age, who, one Sunday morning, presented\r\nher outstretched withered arm and open palm to the congregation\r\nas they left the house of God after morning service. Penny\r\nafter penny fell into her hand, though she never opened her\r\nlips. All appeared to know the purpose, and thirty pennies\r\nwere speedily collected. Presently the parson came with his\r\nfamily, and then she spoke for the first time, soliciting the\r\nclergyman to change the copper coins into one silver one.\r\nThis wish was readily acceded to, and the paralysed woman\r\nhobbled into the church, and up the aisle, to the Communion\r\nrails. A few words passed between her and the clerk, she was\r\nadmitted within the rails, and the clerk moved the Communion\r\ntable from against the wall that she might walk round it, which",
  "p2040.png": "she did three times. \"Now,\" said she, \"with God's blessing,\r\nI shall be cured; my blessed bit of silver must be made into a\r\nring, and within three weeks after it is on my finger, I shall get\r\nthe use of my limbs again.\"\r\n\r\nAubrey, in his \"Miscellanies,\" relates a prophecy in connection\r\nwith the ring of James VI. of Scotland:\r\n\r\n\"'O thou sixth King to God due honours pay,\r\nRemember, Prince, soon after thou'lt expire,\r\nWhen thou behold'st thy carbuncle display,\r\nBlaze against blaze amidst the red'ning fire.'\r\n\r\nThese verses were made by George Buchanan, but (perhaps)\r\nthe prediction was made by some second-sighted person. King\r\nJames of Scotland, the Sixth, was taken with an ague at Trinity\r\nCollege in Cambridge. He removed to Theobald's (where he\r\ndied) sitting by the fire; the carbuncle fell out of his ring into\r\nthe fire, according to the prediction.\"\r\n\r\nTHE superstitions connected with the marriage-ring in the\r\nmiddle ages were various in France. To secure protection\r\nagainst diabolical arts, a ring of cane or of straw, or one\r\nmade from the nail of a horse-shoe, was placed on the finger of\r\nthe fianc\u00e9e; sometimes a ring passed three times in water with\r\nthe words \"in nomine Patris\" was employed. Some had as\r\nmany as five rings blessed, and placed them on the ring-finger\r\nof the bride. It was also the practice to place a ring under the\r\nfeet of the marriage couple during the ceremony. A barrel of\r\nwhite wine was broached, and the first drops of it were poured\r\nover the marriage-ring.\r\n\r\nOn which finger the wedding-ring should be worn was long the\r\nsubject of learned dissertations; an old writer remarks that a\r\nring worn on the fore-finger indicates a haughty, bold, and overbearing\r\nspirit; on the long finger, prudence, dignity, and discretion;\r\non the marriage-finger, love and affection; on the\r\nlittle finger, a masterful spirit.[*]\r\n\r\n* Bacon, in his \"Sylva Sylvarum,\" in the chapter on Sympathy and\r\nAntipathy, suggests that a trial should be made by two persons of the",
  "p2050.png": "\r\nCaptain Burnaby, in his \"Ride to Khiva,\" says that a favourite\r\namusement in Russia, when several girls are congregated under\r\nthe same roof, is to divine by aid of a cock, which maiden will\r\nbe married first. Each girl, taking some corn, makes a small\r\nheap on the floor, and there conceals a ring. The bird is then\r\nintroduced and let loose beside the corn. Presently he begins\r\nto peck at the heaps of grain. At last one of the rings is exposed\r\nto view, when its owner, according to popular belief, will\r\noutstrip her companions in the race for matrimony.\r\n\r\nAt Nova, in Sweden, young girls place under their separate\r\npots a ring, a coin, and a piece of black ribbon. If the ring is\r\nturned up the girl will be married; if the money, she will get a\r\nrich husband; and if the black ribbon, she will die an old\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\nPegge, in his \"Curialia,\" alludes to the superstition that a\r\nwedding-ring of gold, rubbed on a stye upon the eyelid, was\r\nconsidered a sovereign remedy, but it required to be rubbed\r\nnine times. In Beaumont and Fletcher's \"Mad Lovers,\" there\r\nis an allusion to this popular belief.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the explanation of the merits of the gold\r\nwedding-ring used for this purpose, is, that it is something\r\nwhich once given can never be taken back; and the Barbadians\r\nbelieve if you give anything away and take it back again, you\r\nare sure of a stye, or \"cat-boil,\" as they call it.\r\n\r\nFrom marriage to death, the practice of wearing \"In Memoriam\"\r\nrings, with representations on them of the skull and\r\ncrossed bones, is well commented on in a sermon by Robinson,\r\nBishop of Bangor: \"Many carry Death on their fingers, when\r\nhe is never nigh their hearts.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same subject a writer in the Connoisseur (No. 39)\r\n\r\neffect of compact and agreement, that a ring should be put on for each\r\nother's sake; to try whether, if one should break his promise, the other\r\nwould have any feeling of it in his absence.\r\n\r\n\"It is supposed a help to the continuance of love to wear a ring or\r\nbracelet of the person beloved; but this may proceed from exciting the\r\nimagination, which, perhaps, a glove, or other the like favour, might do as\r\nwell.\"",

I knew a young lady who wore on the same finger\r\na ring set round with death's heads and cross marrow bones for\r\nthe loss of her father, and another prettily embellished with\r\nburning hearts pierced through with darts in respect to her\r\nlover.\"\r\n\r\nA SINGULAR interest is attached to the Coronation ring\r\nof our earlier kings, by the miraculous history of the\r\nring of Edward the Confessor. This is given in the \"Golden\r\nLegende\" (Julyan Notary, 1503). The king being one day\r\nasked for alms by a certain \"fayre olde man,\" he found nothing\r\nto give him but his ring, with which the poor man thankfully\r\ndeparted. Some time after, two English pilgrims in the Holy\r\nLand, having lost their road as they travelled at the close of\r\nday, \"there came to them a fayr auncyent man wyth whyte\r\nheer for age. Thenne y^e olde man axed theym what they were,\r\nand of what regyon. And they answerde that they were\r\npylgryms of Englond, and hadde lost theyr felyshyp and way also.\r\nThenne thys olde man comforted theym goodly, and brought\r\ntheym into a fayre cytee; and whan they had well refresshyd\r\ntheym, and rested there alle nyhte, on the morne this fayr\r\nolde man wente with thyem[** typo theym?], and broughte theym in the ryghte\r\nwaye agayne.

And\r\nwhan he shold departe fro theym thenne he tolde theym what\r\nhe was, and sayd, I AM JOHAN THEUANGELYST, and saye ye\r\nvnto Edward your kyng that I grete hym well by the token\r\nthat he gaaf to me, thys Rynge with his one hondes, whych\r\nrynge ye shalle delyuer to hym againe: and whan he had\r\ndelyuerde to theym the ryng he departed fro theym sodenly.\"\r\n\r\nThis command, as may be supposed, was punctually obeyed\r\nby the messengers, who were furnished with ample powers for",
  "p2070.png": "authenticating their mission. The ring was received by the\r\nRoyal Confessor, and in after times was preserved with due\r\ncare at his shrine in Westminster Abbey. In the Confessor's\r\nChapel are represented fourteen subjects in relievi, on the frieze\r\nof the western side, of incidents in the king's life, in which the\r\nlegend of the \"Pilgrim\" is curiously displayed. The whole\r\nlength of this sculpture is thirty-eight feet six inches, by three\r\nin height. The relief is very bold, the irregular concave ground\r\nbeing much hollowed out behind. The compartment relating\r\nto the ring represents St. John, in the garb of a pilgrim, asking\r\nalms of the king. The figures are much injured. The\r\nmonarch occupies the centre of the compartment, and a pilgrim,\r\nor beggar, is before him on the spectator's right hand. Behind\r\nthe king is a figure holding a pastoral staff--probably an ecclesiastic--and\r\nin front of whom, between the king and himself,\r\nis an object not easily defined, but which appears like a basket.\r\nThis design is interesting, from the background being entirely\r\nfilled in by a large and handsome church. This refers to the\r\nsubject mentioned in the chronicle written by \u00c6lred, a monk,\r\nand, later, Abbot of Rievaulx, who died in 1106, of the king\r\nbeing engaged in the construction of a church in honour of St\r\nJohn, when the pilgrim appeared and asked alms.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice that amongst the documents and\r\npapers belonging to Westminster Abbey (a catalogue or inventory\r\nof which was prepared by Widmore, in the last century),\r\nis a grant by Richard II., in the twelfth year of his reign, to\r\nthe Abbot, etc., of Westminster, of a certain ring, with a\r\nprecious ruby inserted therein, for the shrine of the Confessor,\r\nwith the condition that he might use the said ring when in\r\nEngland, but that it was to be placed on the shrine when the\r\nking went abroad, and to be used for the coronation of the\r\nking's successors.\r\n\r\nThere is a portion of a letter, apparently from the Abbot of\r\nWestminster to the king, in reference to the \"noble relic,\" the\r\nring of St Edward, of which he was the keeper. In the letter\r\nhe begs pardon for some trespass in respect of sending the",
  "p2080.png": "ring to the king, and prays him to save the rights of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn the Harleian MS. (No. 2165), a crest is given to St.\r\nEdward, viz., out of a ducal coronet or, a hand erect, proper,\r\nholding a gem-ring of the first, jewelled sapphire, evidently in\r\nallusion to the heavenly vision.\r\n\r\nTHE origin of St. Mark's ring is thus given in the old\r\nchronicles of Venice. Two centuries after the translation\r\nof the remains of the saint to Venice, when the Emperor\r\nHenry III. made an express pilgrimage to his shrine, the body\r\nhad very strangely disappeared. The priests had recourse to\r\nprayers and fasting for its recovery, and the whole city was\r\nafflicted to tears, to abstinence, and to supplications. At\r\nlength the saint relented. One morning the sacristan, whose\r\nturn it was to attend the church in which the body ought to\r\nhave been found, perceived on entering a fragrant odour,\r\nand a brilliant light which issued from a particular column.\r\nThe simple priest imagined that there was a fire, and ran up\r\nin a fright to extinguish it; nor was his alarm diminished when\r\nhe saw a human arm protruding from the column. He\r\nhastened to the Doge and announced this marvel, and the\r\nBishop of Olivolo and the other clergy having been summoned,\r\nrepaired with profound devotion to the church. There, as they\r\nknelt before the pillar, the arm dropped a ring from one of the\r\nfingers of its hand into the bishop's bosom, and at the same\r\ntime the column opened, and displayed an iron coffin, enclosing\r\nthe remains of the Evangelist.\r\n\r\nTHE famous legend by which Venice was preserved on a\r\ncritical occasion is told in the old Venetian chronicles,\r\nto the following effect: \"On February 25, 1340, there fell out\r\na wonderful thing in this land; for during three days the water\r\nrose continually, and in the night there was fearful rain and\r\ntempest, such as had never been heard of. So great was the\r\nstorm that the waters rose three cubits higher than had ever",
  "p2090.png": "been known in Venice; and an old fisherman being in his\r\nlittle boat in the canal of St. Mark, reached with difficulty the\r\nRiva di San Marco, and there he fastened his boat, and waited\r\nthe ceasing of the storm. And it is related that, at the time\r\nthis storm was at its highest, there came an unknown man, and\r\nbesought him that he would row him over to San Giorgio\r\nMaggiore, promising to pay him well; and the fisherman\r\nreplied, 'How is it possible to go to San Giorgio? we shall\r\nsink by the way.' But the man only besought him the more\r\nthat he should set forth. So, seeing that it was the will of God,\r\nhe arose and rowed over to San Giorgio Maggiore; and the\r\nman landed there, and desired the boatman to wait. In a\r\nshort time he returned with a young man; and they said,\r\n'Now row towards San Nicolo di Lido.' And the fisherman\r\nsaid, 'How can one possibly go so far with one oar?' And\r\nthey said, 'Row boldly, for it shall be possible to thee, and\r\nthou shalt be well paid.' And he went; and it appeared to\r\nhim as if the waters were smooth. Being arrived at San Nicolo\r\ndi Lido, the two men landed, and returned with a third, and\r\nhaving entered into the boat, they commanded the fisherman\r\nthat he should row between the two castles. And the tempest\r\nraged continually. Being come to the open sea, they beheld\r\napproaching, with such terrific speed that it appeared to fly\r\nover the waters, an enormous galley full of demons (as it is\r\nwritten in the Chronicles, and Marco Sabellino also makes\r\nmention of this miracle): the said bark approached the castles\r\nto overwhelm Venice, and to destroy it utterly: anon the sea,\r\nwhich had hitherto been tumultuous, became calm; and these\r\nthree men, having made the sign of the cross, exorcised the\r\ndemons, and commanded them to depart, and immediately the\r\ngalley or the ship vanished. Then these three men commanded\r\nthe fisherman to land them, the one at San Nicolo di\r\nLido, the other at San Giorgio Maggiore, and the third at San\r\nMarco. And when he had landed the third, the fisherman,\r\nnotwithstanding the miracle he had witnessed, desired that he\r\nwould pay him; and he replied, 'Thou art right; go now to",
  "p2100.png": "the Doge, and to the Procuratori (who had the charge of the\r\nchurch and the treasury of St. Mark), and tell them what thou\r\nhast seen, for Venice would have been overwhelmed had it not\r\nbeen for us three. I am St. Mark the Evangelist, the protector\r\nof this city; the other is the brave knight St. George;\r\nand he whom thou didst take up at the Lido is the holy bishop\r\nSt. Nicholas. Say to the Doge and the Procuratori that they\r\nare to pay you; and tell them likewise that this tempest arose\r\nbecause of a certain schoolmaster dwelling at San Felice, who\r\ndid sell his soul to the devil, and afterwards hanged himself.'\r\nAnd the fisherman replied, 'If I should tell them this they\r\nwill not believe me.' Then St. Mark took off a ring from his\r\nfinger, which ring was worth five ducats; and he said, 'Show\r\nthem this, and tell them when they look in the sanctuary, they\r\nwill not find it,' and thereupon he disappeared. The next\r\nmorning the said fisherman appeared before the Doge, and\r\nrelated all he had seen the night before, and showed him the\r\nring for a sign. And the Procuratori having sent for the ring,\r\nand sought in the usual place, found it not; by reason of which\r\nmiracle the fisherman was paid, and a solemn procession was\r\nordained, giving thanks to God, and to the relics of the three\r\nholy saints who rest in our land, and delivered us from this\r\ngreat danger. The ring was given to Signor Marco Loredano,\r\nand to Signor Andrea, the Procuratori, who placed it in the\r\nsanctuary; and, moveover[** typo? moreover], a perpetual provision was made for\r\nthe aged fisherman above named.\"\r\n\r\nThis legend is the subject of two celebrated pictures; one,\r\nattributed to Giorgione, represents the storm; the other, by\r\nParis Bordone, illustrates the fisherman presenting the miraculous\r\nring of St. Mark to the Doge Gradenigo.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Evangelist's ring was stolen in 1585, and\r\nthat although his body was deposited in a mysterious\r\nreceptacle known only to the Doge and the Proveditori, it\r\nlong ago disappeared. Eustace, in his \"Classical Tour in\r\nItaly,\" accuses the Doge Carossio of having sold the precious\r\nrelic. At all events its present depository is unknown.",
  "p2110.png": "\r\nBECMAN, in a German work, \"History of the Principality\r\nof Anhalt\" (published 1722), relates an old tradition\r\ngenerally believed in that country. A princess used to shake\r\nevery day her napkin out of the window immediately after\r\ndinner; and a large toad constantly received what fell from it.\r\nThe princess, being near her accouchement, saw one night a\r\nmaid coming to her bedside with a candle in her hand, who\r\ntold her that the toad was very thankful for the care she took\r\nto feed it, and sent her a gold ring with instructions that it\r\nshould be kept very carefully, as the safety of Anhalt depended\r\nupon it. The toad likewise recommended that every year,\r\non Christmas Eve, great care should be taken of the fire, lest\r\nthe house should be burnt that night. The ring (observes\r\nBecman) is not only kept at Dessau to this present time (1722),\r\nbut also great care is taken each Christmas Eve to put out the\r\nfires all over the palace about the dusk of the evening, and in\r\nthe rooms of the princes about eight o'clock, and several\r\nwatchmen go round all the night to prevent a fire.\r\n\r\nIN the \"Gesta Romanorum\" are frequent allusions to rings.\r\nOne relates to the story of Pompey, a wise and powerful\r\nking, with an only daughter, who, notwithstanding his precautions\r\nfor her welfare, became the victim of a seducer\r\neventually punished with death. Deeply impressed with her\r\nwickedness, she became reconciled to her indignant parent,\r\nand was betrothed to a powerful nobleman. After this she\r\nreceived many gifts from her father. The champion who had\r\nfought and killed her seducer presented her with a ring, on\r\nwhich was engraved, \"I have loved thee, learn thou to love.\"\r\nThe person who had mediated between herself and her father\r\ngave another, inscribed, \"What have I done? how much?\r\nwhy?\" A ring was presented by the king's son, with the\r\ninscription, \"Thou art noble, despise not thy nobility.\" Her\r\nown brother gave a similar gift, of which the motto was,\r\n\"Approach, fear not--I am thy brother.\" Her husband likewise\r\nadded a golden signet, which confirmed his wife in the",
  "p2120.png": "inheritance of his goods, and bore this superscription, \"Now\r\nthou art espoused, sin no more.\" The lady succeeded in\r\nregaining the favour of all, and died in peace. The application[*]\r\nof this story runs thus: Christ is our champion, who gave us a\r\nring--that is the hole in His right hand, and we ourselves may\r\nperceive how faithfully it is written: \"I have loved thee, learn\r\nthou to love,\" Rev. i. He gave us another ring, which is the\r\npuncture in His left hand, where we see written: \"What have\r\nI done? I have despoiled myself, receiving the form of a\r\nservant. How much? I have made God man. Why? To\r\nredeem the lost. Concerning these three--Zachary xiii.;\r\n\"What are the wounds in the middle of thy hands?\" And\r\nHe answered, saying: \"I am wounded by these men in their\r\nhouse, who loved me.\" Christ is our brother, and son of the\r\nEternal King. He gave us a third ring, to wit, the hole in His\r\nright foot, and what can be understood by it except, \"Thou\r\nart noble, despise not thy nobility.\" He gave us another ring,\r\nthe puncture in His left foot, on which is written: \"Approach,\r\nfear not--I am thy brother.\" Christ is also our spouse; He\r\ngave us a signet with which He confirms our inheritance: that\r\nis, the wound made in His side by the spear, on account of the\r\ngreat love with which He loved us, and what can this signify\r\nbut--\"Thou art now joined to me through mercy; sin no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same work, the Emperor Leo is said to have had\r\nthree images made. On one of the fingers of the first image\r\nwas placed a golden ring bearing the device, \"My finger is\r\ngenerous, behold this ring.\" On the other images were a\r\nbeard, and a golden cloak and tunic. It was ordained that\r\nanyone stealing these objects should be put to death. A thief\r\nbeing taken in the attempt, excused himself to the emperor by\r\nsaying: \"When I entered the temple, the first image extended\r\ntowards me its finger with the golden ring--as if it had said:\r\n'Here, take the ring.' Yet not merely because the ring was\r\n\r\n* Attempts like these to strain everything into an allegory are very\r\nfrequent in these \"mystical and moral applications.\"",
  "p2130.png": "held forth to me would I have received it; but, by-and-by, I\r\nread the superscription, which said: 'My finger is generous--take\r\nthe ring.' At once I understood it was the statue's\r\npleasure to bestow it upon me, and therefore I took it.\"\r\n\r\nThis special pleading was, however, in vain, and the man\r\nwas hanged.\r\n\r\nIN Busk's \"Folk-lore of Rome\" there is a pretty fairy story\r\nin connection with a ring:\r\n\r\nA king had an only daughter, whom he ardently wished to\r\nsee married before he died. His queen, on her death-bed,\r\ngave him a ring, with the advice to listen to no one on Maria's\r\nbehalf, but his[**him?] whose finger the gold ring should fit, and who\r\nwould then be a noble and a worthy husband indeed. Time\r\nwent by, and no one who came to court Maria had a finger\r\nwhich the ring would fit. At length a prince arrived, with a\r\nbrilliant retinue, who, after some hesitation, consented to try\r\nhis fate; but the ring could not be found. The prince proposed,\r\ninstead of the ordeal, to submit to three tests of his\r\nsincerity, which Maria should impose. The young lady had a\r\nteacher gifted with fairy powers, to whom she confided her dislike\r\nto the prince, and asked her advice. The wise woman\r\nknew that the wooer was an evil spirit, but that it was useless\r\nto tell this to the father of Maria, who would only laugh at such\r\na notion; and she also concealed it from the young lady,\r\nsimply telling her to ask the prince for a dress woven from the\r\nstars of heaven. Evincing much displeasure and vexation at\r\nhearing this test, the wooer, however, said: \"You shall receive\r\nit to-morrow morning; and at the same time, name your second\r\ntest.\" On consulting her teacher, she was advised to ask for a\r\ndress woven of moonbeams.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the dress woven of the stars of heaven\r\nwas brought in by six pages, and it was all they could do to\r\ncarry it, for the dazzling of the rays of the stars in their eyes.\r\nWhen the dress of moonbeams was required, the prince\r\npromised it on the morrow, and required then the third test.",
  "p2140.png": "The teacher told her to ask for a dress woven of sunbeams.\r\nThe moonbeam robe was duly brought, but it required twelve\r\npages to bring it, for it was so dazzling they could only hold it\r\nfor a few minutes, and had to carry it in relays, six at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the third test, the prince was exceedingly angry,\r\nbut while consenting, he said in a threatening tone: \"And\r\nremember, when it comes to-morrow morning, you will have no\r\nmore tests to prefer, but you will belong to me for ever, and\r\nmust be prepared to go away with me.\" Maria was in great\r\ntrouble, and her father finding her in that state, reproved her\r\nfor disliking the prince. However, she is told by her teacher\r\nthe truth about him, and that if she declines to marry him,\r\nshe will have to undergo many trials and privations, which\r\nshe must be prepared to encounter. The teacher goes on\r\nto say that she will have to go with the disguised evil spirit,\r\nbut when they reach a wood, she must endeavour to obtain\r\npossession of her ring, which he had stolen, and would wear\r\non a feather in his cap. This obtained, he would have no\r\npower over her against her will. The teacher had made a\r\nwooden figure of an old woman, in which she placed the\r\ndresses that had been given to Maria, and set it under a\r\ntree in a wood.\r\n\r\nThe prince and princess arrived in the evening close to this\r\nspot, and the latter, pretending to see a firefly, tried to run\r\nafter it, the prince following, but far behind. Maria, taking\r\nanother route, reaches the wooden figure; and following her\r\nteacher's instructions, gets into it. The prince returns, and\r\nnot finding Maria, asks (what he takes for an old woman)\r\nwhich way the lady had taken; and is directed by Maria, in\r\na feigned voice, to some recesses in the wood, where he\r\ngets lost, and wanders about all night, while Maria slips away.\r\nShe goes through numerous adventures, and at length marries\r\na king, to whom, when prince, she had given a ring at a ball,\r\nand who was lying sick at heart to find out the owner. While\r\nengaged as kitchen-maid at the king's palace, Maria makes",
  "p2150.png": "a cake, which she gave out would relieve the king, and\r\nplaces the ring, which she had obtained by some means,\r\nwhich, on being recognised by the king, she is discovered, and\r\nmarries him.\r\n\r\nA STORY, in which a ring is also dropped into a cake, is\r\nrelated in Perrault's rimed fable of \"Peau d'Ane,\"\r\nwhich is somewhat in the \"Cinderella\" vein. A princess\r\nhas a fairy godmother, who provides her with sumptuous\r\ndresses, which she is only to wear on holidays. In quest of\r\na princely lover, she becomes hen-wife in a king's farm-yard.\r\nOne day, arraying herself in a brilliant dress in her room, the\r\nson of the king sees her through a keyhole, and falls ill because\r\nhis parents object to their union. Peau d'Ane makes him a\r\ncake, into which she drops one of her rings. The prince is\r\ncharmed with the idea of the hand it suggests to him; his\r\nmalady increases, and this softens his parents. He says he\r\nwill marry no one but her whom the ring fits, and thus, of\r\ncourse, Peau d'Ane marries him.\r\n\r\nHORACE MARRYAT, in his \"One Year in Sweden,\"\r\nmentions an old Swedish rhyme, said to have been\r\nonce carved on a rune-stone:\r\n\r\n\"Between Fur and Fla,\r\nWithin stone coffins twa,\r\nLie gold ring and gold ring,\r\nA hundred thousand gold rings.\r\nBy twins born in Ed,\r\nThree feet under ground,\r\nShall this golden treasure,\r\nWhen digging, be found.\"\r\n\r\nEvery twin who sees light in Ed, it appears, fancies himself\r\nborn with a gold ring.\r\n\r\nThe first goldsmith mentioned in the Sagas is one W\u00f6lund,\r\na Sm\u00e5lander, who emigrated with his two brothers to Upland,\r\nand dwelt at Ulfdal, near the sea: he espoused a nymph of\r\nOdin, whom he found clad in a dress of swansdown, spinning",
  "p2160.png": "her flax by the sea-shore. Seven winters they dwelt together;\r\nthe eighth she became discontented, and the ninth she flew\r\naway. W\u00f6lund remained in Ulfdal forging gold, setting it\r\nround with precious stones, waiting the nymph's return, but she\r\ncame not. The King of Nerike, who had heard the fame of\r\nthis great worker of metals, sent spies to the land. W\u00f6lund\r\nwas out hunting when they came to his cottage. On entering,\r\nthey found seven hundred golden rings hanging to the rafters.\r\nRemoving one, they hid themselves. When the smith returned\r\nhe counted the rings, and missing one, fancied that his swan-*bride\r\nhad returned. Greatly rejoiced, he sat down waiting her\r\ncoming and fell asleep. The men seized the smith, and binding\r\nhim, brought him to King Ridung's court. \"My liege\r\nlord,\" said the queen, \"'tis best to hamstring the gold-worker\r\nthat he may not run away.\" Her advice was followed, and\r\nW\u00f6lund, placed in a smithy on an island, wrought rich ornaments.\r\nThe king's daughter, Bothwilda, broke her ring--the\r\nvery ring stolen by the spies--and going to W\u00f6lund, begged\r\nhim to mend it. He did so. Bothwilda then led W\u00f6lund to\r\nthe green grove, and there married him. The king's sons one\r\nday coming to the island, the goldsmith in revenge slew them.\r\nHaving disposed of their bodies, he mounted their skulls into\r\ndrinking-cups, adorned with gold and pearls, and gave them to\r\ntheir father. W\u00f6lund now made himself wings. The king in\r\nhis grief asked him about his sons' deaths. The goldsmith\r\nstood on a rock, and answered, \"First, swear by the deck of\r\nyour long ship, by the border of your shield, by the back of\r\nyour horse, and the edge of your sword, that no injury shall\r\ncome to W\u00f6lund's bride, or to his son, and then I will tell\r\nthee.\" King Ridung took the oath. \"Go to the smithy you\r\nbuilt for me; there will you find a flooring stained with blood;\r\nthere I cut off the heads of your sons and laid their bones\r\nbeneath.\" Then he told him how Bothwilda had borne him a\r\nson, committed her to the king's care, and flew away on his\r\nwings. Now Ridung regrets his violence; he cries, \"I wake\r\nand I sleep ever joyless. Oh, my sons, my sons!\"",

Friends remarked,\r\n\"You are sure to find it;\" but she, in her pride, answered, \"It\r\nis as impossible for that ring to be found as for me to become\r\npoor.\" Both came to pass; a fish brought up the ring.

This, with other\r\nvaluable things, was given by Queen Yrsa to her son, King\r\nRolf, who was in antagonism with Adil, and meeting him, cast\r\nthe precious ring Swiagris out on the road, which, when Adil\r\nsaw, he said, \"Kinder has been to him than to me, who gave\r\nKing Rolfe[**?: Rolf] this ring,\" then bowed himself and stretched forth\r\nhis lance at the same time towards the ground, to recover the\r\nring.

  "p2200.png": "\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWORD AND LETTER DIVINATION.\r\n\r\nDivination by words or characters is of very ancient\r\norigin. What were called Sortes Viales, or street and\r\nroad \"lots,\" were used both in Greece and Rome. The person\r\ndesirous to learn his fortune carried with him a certain number\r\nof lots, distinguished by several characters or inscriptions, and\r\nwalking to and fro by the public ways, desired the first boy he\r\nmet to draw, and the inscription on the lot thus drawn was\r\nreceived as an infallible prophecy. Plutarch declares that this\r\nform of divination was derived from the Egyptians, by whom\r\nthe actions and words of boys were carefully observed as containing\r\nin them something prophetical. Another form of the\r\nSortes Viales was exhibited by a boy, sometimes by a man, who\r\nposted himself in a public place to give responses to all comers.\r\nHe was provided with a tablet on which certain verses were\r\nwritten; when consulted, he cast dice on the tablet, and the\r\nverses on which they fell were supposed to contain the proper\r\ndirection. Sometimes instead of tablets they had urns, in\r\nwhich the verses were thrown, written upon slips of parchment.\r\nThe verse drawn out was received as a sure guide and direction.\r\nTo this custom Tibullus alludes:\r\n\r\n\"Thrice in the streets the sacred lots she threw,\r\nAnd thrice the boy a happy omen drew.\"\r\n\r\nThis form of divining was often practised with the Sibylline\r\noracles.",
  "p2210.png": "\r\nAmong the ancients there was also a divination by opening\r\nsome poems at hazard, and accepting the passage which first\r\nturned up as an answer. This practice probably arose from the\r\nesteem in which poets were held as divine and inspired persons.\r\nAmong the Greeks the works of Homer had the most credit,\r\nbut the tragedies of Euripides, and other celebrated poems,\r\nwere used for the same purpose. The Latins chiefly consulted\r\nVirgil,[*] and many curious coincidents are related by grave his-*\r\n\r\n* Dr. Ferrand, in his \"Love Melancholy\" (1640), mentions the \"kinde\r\nof divination by the opening of a booke, at all adventures, and this was\r\ncalled the Valentinian chance, and by some Sortes Virgilian\u00e6, of which the\r\nEmperor Adrian was wont to make much use.\"\r\n\r\nAubrey relates, that \"in December, 1648, King Charles the First, being in\r\ngreat trouble, and prisoner at Caersbroke, or to be brought to London to\r\nhis triall; Charles, Prince of Wales, being then in Paris, and in profound\r\nsorrow for his father, Mr. Abraham Cowley went to wayte on him. His\r\nHighness asked him whether he would play at cards to divert his sad\r\nthoughts. Mr. Cowley replied he did not care to play at cards, but if his\r\nHighnesse pleased they would use Sortes Virgilian\u00e6. Mr. Cowley alwaies\r\nhad a Virgil in his pocket. The Prince accepted the proposal, and prickt his\r\npinne in the fourth booke of the \u00c6neid, at this place----(iv. 615, et seq.).\r\n\r\n\"The Prince understood not Latin well, and desired Mr. Cowley to\r\ntranslate the verses, which he did admirably well, and Mr. George Ent\r\n(who lived in his house at Chertsey, in the great plague, 1665) showed me\r\nMr. Cowley's own handwriting.\r\n\r\n\"By a bold people's stubborn arms opprest,\r\nForced to forsake the land he once possesst,\r\nTorn from his dearest sonne, let him in vain\r\nSeeke help, and see his friends unjustly slain.\r\nLet him to base unequal terms submit,\r\nIn hope to save his crown, yet loose both it\r\nAnd life at once, untimely let him dy,\r\nAnd on an open stage unburied ly.\"\r\n\r\nA very different account of this relation is given by Welwood, in his\r\n\"Memoirs,\" where it is stated that it was the king himself, who, being at\r\nOxford, and viewing the public library, was shown a magnificent Virgil,\r\nand induced by Lord Falkland to make a trial of his fortune by the Sortes\r\nVirgilian\u00e6, and opened the book at the passage referred to. Welwood adds:\r\n\"It is said King Charles seemed concerned at the accident, and that the\r\nLord Falkland observing it, would also try his own fortune in the same\r\nmanner, hoping he might fall upon some passage that could have no relation\r\nto his case, and thereby divert the king's thoughts from any impression that\r\nthe other had made on him; but the place that Falkland stumbled upon\r\nwas yet more suited to his destiny than the other had been to the king's,\r\nbeing the following expression of Evander upon the untimely death of his\r\nson Pallas, as they are translated by Dryden:",

He had his mind\r\naffected by a Sors Homerica, communicated in a dream.\r\n\r\nBrutus drew a presage from the coincidence of his opening\r\non the passage in the Iliad, where Patroclus remarks that Fate\r\nand the son of Latona had caused his death, and \"Apollo\"\r\nbeing the watchword on the day of the battle of Pharsalia.\r\n\r\nThe bath kol of the Hebrews was much of the same kind\r\nwith the Sortes Homeric\u00e6 and Sortes Virgilian\u00e6, practised by the\r\nGreeks and Romans especially after their other oracles ceased\r\non the coming of Christ. The difference was, the Jews took\r\ntheir oracle from the first words they heard anybody pronounce.[*]\r\n\r\nThis species of word divination was among the ancients\r\ncalled Cledonismantia, the good or evil presage of certain words\r\n\r\n\"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,\r\nTo fight with caution, nor to tempt the sword;\r\nI warned thee, but in vain; for well I knew\r\nWhat perils youthful ardour would pursue;\r\nThat boiling blood would carry thee too far,\r\nYoung as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!\r\nO curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,\r\nPrelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, in his \"Life of Cowley,\" suspects the poet to have been\r\ntinctured with the divination mania, and to have consulted the Virgilian lots\r\non the occasion of the Scottish treaty.\r\n\r\n* Bacon, treating on the effects of imagination, says: \"And, for words;\r\nthere have been always, either barbarous ones, and of no signification, lest\r\nthey should disturb the imagination; or words of similitude, to second and\r\nfeed it; and this as well in heathen charms, as those of later times. They\r\nalso use Scripture words; for the belief that religious texts and words have\r\npower, and may strengthen the imagination. And for the same reason,\r\nHebrew words, which with us, are accounted more holy and mystical, are\r\noften used for this purpose.\"",
  "p2230.png": "uttered without premeditation when persons came together in\r\nany way; it also regulated the words to be used on particular\r\noccasions. Cicero says the Pythagoreans were very attentive to\r\nthese presages; and, according to Pausanius[**Pausanias?], it was a favourite\r\nmethod of divination at Smyrna, where the oracles of Apollo\r\nwere thus interpreted,\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks it was an ancient custom to refer misfortunes\r\nto the signification of proper names. The Scholiast upon\r\nSophocles, as cited by Jodrell in his \"Euripides,\" observes\r\nthat this ludicrous custom of analysing the proper names of\r\npersons, and deriving ominous inferences from their different\r\nsignifications in their state of analysis, appears to have prevailed\r\namong the Greek poets of the first reputation. \"Shakspeare,\"\r\nhe adds, \"was much addicted to it.\" He instances\r\n\"Richard II.,\" Act ii. sc. 1: \"How is't with aged Gaunt?\"\r\n\r\nUNDER the first race of the French kings a most profane\r\npractice (though called the Sortes Sanctorum) was substituted\r\nfor the Homeric or Virgilian lots.[*] Three different\r\nbooks of the Bible were taken, for instance, the Prophecies,\r\nthe Gospels, and the Epistles of St Paul. Having laid them\r\non the altar of some saint by way of enhancing the piety of\r\n\r\n* The Christians, when their religion came to be corrupted, adopted this\r\ntrick of divination from the heathens, only using the Bible, however. The\r\npractice appears to have been as ancient as Austin, who lived in the fourth\r\ncentury. He mentions it in his 109th epistle[**unclear] to Januarius, and though he\r\ndisallows it in secular, he seems to approve of it in spiritual affairs.\r\n\r\nFrom the fourth to the fourteenth century, the Sortes Sanctorum, or\r\ndivinations by the Bible, were repeatedly condemned by the decrees of\r\ncouncils, and repeatedly practised by kings, bishops and saints. Thus, when\r\nClovis went on his march against the Visigoths, a.d. 507, his anxiety\r\ntempted him to consult the shrine of St. Martin, the sanctuary and the\r\noracle of Gaul. His messengers were instructed to remark the words of\r\nthe psalm which should happen to be chanted at the precise moment they\r\nentered the church. These words fortunately expressed the valour and\r\nvictory of the champions of heaven, and the application was easily transferred\r\nto the new Joshua, the new Gideon, who went to battle against the\r\nenemies of God.\r\n\r\n\"It appears,\" says Bingham, \"that some of the inferior clergy, out of a\r\nbase spirit and love of filthy lucre, encouraged this practice, and made a\r\ntrade of it in the French Church; whence the Gallican Councils are very\r\nfrequent in the condemnation of it.\"",
  "p2240.png": "the proceeding, the consulters opened the book at hazard,\r\nand entered into a solemn examination of the texts, to\r\nascertain in what respects they were applicable to the points\r\nthey wished to ascertain. It is obvious that this would not\r\nalways end in mere folly, but that the cunning contrivers of\r\nthe accidental opening would take care that the book would\r\nopen at such leaves as should contain some fact or sentiment\r\nwhich they might wrest to the purposes they designed to promote.\r\nLouis le D\u00e9bonnaire had the merit of abolishing this\r\ncustom. In the Ordinances of that sovereign the law to such\r\neffect is found in the following terms: \"Ut nullus in Psalterio,\r\nvel Evangelio, vel aliis rebus sortiri pr\u00e6sumat, nec divinationes\r\naliquas observare.\"\r\n\r\nOn this subject some curious superstitions are related by\r\nGregory of Tours. When Chramm, who revolted against his\r\nfather Clothaire, went to D\u00edjon[**accent or speck?], \"the priest of the cathedral,\"\r\nsays Gregory, \"having placed on the altar three books, the\r\nProphets, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Evangelists,\r\nprayed to God that He would enlighten them to know what\r\nwould happen to Chramm, and to declare by His divine power,\r\nif he would be successful, and if he might hope to reign. It\r\nwas agreed that each one should read at the service that which\r\nhe found on opening the book,\" etc.\r\n\r\nGregory also relates that M\u00e9rov\u00e9e, flying from the anger of\r\nhis father Chilperic, and from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9gonde, placed upon the\r\ntomb of St Martin, at Tours, three books, the Psalter,\r\nKings, and the Evangelists: \"And watching all night, he\r\nbeseeched his confessor to discover whether he would reign\r\nor not. He passed three days fasting, watching, and praying,\r\nand then approaching the sacred tomb, he opened one\r\nof the books, which happened to be that of 'Kings.'\r\nFrightened at the words he found there, he shed tears at\r\nthe sepulchre of the holy bishop, and then left the temple.\"\r\n\r\nSt Augustine censured the Sortes Apostolorum and Sortes\r\nSanctorum among the Christians in these terms: \"Hi qui de\r\npaginis Evangelicis sortes legunt, etsi optandum est ut hoc",
  "p2250.png": "potius faciant quam ut ad d\u00e6monia consulenda concurrant,\r\ntamen etiam ista mihi displicet consuetudo, ad negotia s\u00e6cularia\r\net ad vit\u00e6 hujus vanitatem propter aliam vitam loquentia\r\noracula divini velle convertere.\" (Ep. 119, ad Januar., c. 20.)\r\n\r\nThe Councils of the Church endeavoured vainly to put down\r\nthis superstition. The sixteenth canon of the Council of\r\nVannes, in 465, warned the clergy under pain of excommunication\r\nfrom this practice. The prohibition extended to the\r\nlaity by the forty-second canon of the Council of Agda, in 506,\r\nand by the thirtieth of Orleans, in 511, was renewed in several\r\nsubsequent councils. But, notwithstanding, divination by the\r\nBible was in common usage. On some occasions it constituted\r\npart of the liturgy; thus, at the consecration of a bishop,\r\nat the moment the book of the Evangelists was placed on his\r\nhead, it was the custom to open the book at hazard, and to\r\nseek in the first verse of the page a prognostic for the future\r\ndestiny of the prelate. In old chronicles and biographies mention\r\nis frequently made of these divinations and their subsequent\r\nverification. \"Landri, bishop-elect of Laon, received,\"\r\nsays Guibert de Nogent, \"episcopal unction in the Church of\r\nSt. Ruffin, but the words of the Evangelist read that day, 'Thy\r\nsoul shall be pierced by a sword,' was a terrible prognostic.\r\nAfter committing several crimes, he was assassinated.\" He\r\nhad for successor an ecclesiastic of Orleans, whose name has\r\nnot transpired. \"The new bishop presenting himself to be\r\nconsecrated, search was made for a particular page in the Bible,\r\nbut it was found entirely blank. It was as if God had said, 'I\r\nhave nothing to predict of this man, for anything he may do\r\nwill reduce itself to nothing.' The bishop died at the end of a\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day of my entrance into the monastery,\" writes Guibert,\r\n\"a monk who had studied the sacred books, offered to read in\r\nthem my future. At the moment he prepared to join the\r\nprocession which was to meet me at the church, he placed on\r\nthe altar a book of the Evangelists, with the intention of draw-*",
  "p2260.png": "*ing a prognostic, when my eyes were fixed on one or the other\r\nchapter. The book was written, not in pages, but in columns.\r\nThe monk fixed his glance on the middle of a third column,\r\nwhere he found the following passage: 'The eye is the candle\r\nof the body.' Then he ordered the priest who had to present\r\nme the book, to take care after I had kissed the silver image\r\nattached to the cover, to place his hand on the passage he\r\nindicated, and to look attentively when he gave me the book\r\non what part of the same page my eyes would be fixed. The\r\npriest opened the book after I had, according to custom, pressed\r\nmy lips upon the cover, and while he remarked curiously where\r\nI should look, my glance was directed neither to the top nor\r\nto the bottom of the page, but precisely upon the words which\r\nhad been intended beforehand. The monk seeing that my\r\naction had accorded, without premeditation on my part, with\r\nhis own, came to me some days after, and told me what he had\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nIn Touraine, at the installation of a canon, the book of the\r\nEvangelists was opened, after being sprinkled with holy water,\r\nand great care was taken in making out the title of the newly-elected,\r\nthat the words first seen should be inserted. This\r\ncustom actually existed in the last century at the church of\r\nBoulogne, and the bishop of the town, De Langle, who died in\r\n1722, had vainly attempted to abolish it.\r\n\r\nThe same divination was practised in the Greek Church.\r\nAt the consecration of Athanasius, made Patriarch of Constantinople\r\nby Constantine Porphyrogenitus, \"Caracalla, Bishop of\r\nNicomedia, having brought the Evangelists,\" says the Byzantine\r\nhistorian, Pachymere, \"the people were curious to hear\r\nthe purport of the oracle on opening the book, although such\r\nmeans are not infallible. The Bishop of Nic\u0153a, who perceived\r\nthat he had fallen upon the words, 'To the devil and his\r\nangels,' sighed from the bottom of his heart. Placing his hand\r\non the words to hide them, he turned the leaves of the book,\r\nand found these words, 'The birds of the sky shall repose\r\nthere,' the meaning of which seemed to have no allusion to the",
  "p2270.png": "ceremony they were inaugurating. An attempt was made to\r\nhide these oracles, but it did not prevent the truth from being\r\nknown. It was said that the words did not imply any condemnation\r\nof the consecration, but they were, nevertheless, the\r\neffect of chance, because there was no chance in the celebration\r\nof mysteries.\"\r\n\r\nAn idea of the importance attached, in similar circumstances,\r\nto the signification of passages from the Evangelists, may be\r\nformed from the following incident. In 1115, discussions\r\nhaving arisen with regard to the elevation of Hugues de Montaign\r\nto the bishopric of Auxerre, the matter was left to the\r\ndecision of Pope Paschal II., who himself consecrated the prelate.\r\nA remark that was made by those who were in his favour\r\nwas, that at the opening of the book from whence they drew\r\nthe oracle, they found the words of the angel to the Virgin,\r\n\"Hail, Mary, full of grace.\" This was considered a good\r\naugury.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of divination took place at the installation of\r\nabbots and canons.\r\n\r\nDIVINATION by the Bible and Key was long popular,\r\nand is even still practised. A writer in Hone's \"Year\r\nBook\" (under date January, 1831) says: \"A few evenings\r\nago a neighbour's daughter came to request of me the loan of\r\na Bible. As I knew they had one of their own, I inquired\r\nwhy mine was wanted. She said that one of their lodgers, a\r\ndisagreeable woman, had lost one of her husband's shirts, and,\r\nsuspecting the thief to be in the house, was going to find it out\r\nby the Bible and key; and for this purpose, neither a Bible\r\nnor key belonging to any person living in the house would do.\r\n'Find a thief by the Bible and key,' thought I; 'I'll even go\r\nand be a spectator of this ceremony.' So I gave the child a\r\nBible and went with her. I found the people of the house\r\nassembled together, and a young boy and girl to hold the apparatus;\r\nfor it seems it can only be done properly by a bachelor\r\nand maid. The key was bound into the Bible against the first",
  "p2280.png": "chapter of Ruth, and part of the seventeenth verse, 'The Lord\r\ndo so to me and more also,' and strict silence and gravity were\r\nthen enjoined, and the ceremony began. First, the boy and\r\ngirl placed their left hands behind their backs, and the key\r\nbalanced on the middle fingers of their right hands; then the\r\nwoman who had lost the above-mentioned article named a\r\nperson, and said, 'The Lord do so to me and more also, has\r\nhe (or she) got my husband's shirt?' Nearly all the names of\r\nthe people in the house had been repeated when, upon the\r\nname of an old crony of the loser being mentioned, the urchin\r\nwho held the Bible suspended from the key gave his hand a\r\nslight motion. Down went the Bible, and the scene of pro-ing\r\nand con-ing which ensued would beggar description. During\r\nthe disturbance I thought it better to look on and laugh, and\r\nretired to a corner of the room, expecting every instant to see\r\nthem do battle. At the height of the disturbance the loser's\r\nhusband came home, and upon learning the cause of the disturbance,\r\nsaid he had removed the shirt himself, and put it\r\ninto his chest. Indignation was now turned upon the person\r\nwho had devised the mode of discovery by the borrowed\r\nBible and key; but she boldly defended it, and said it never\r\nfailed before, nor would it have failed then had not the man in\r\nthe corner--meaning me--laughed; and she added, with malicious\r\nsolemnity, that the Bible would not be laughed at. I\r\nretreated from a gathering storm, and returned home to note\r\ndown the proceedings, and forward them to the 'Year Book.'\"\r\n\r\nThe extracts from newspapers of various dates respecting\r\ndivination by the Bible and key are very curious. A case tried\r\nbefore Mr. Ballantine, the well-known police magistrate (June\r\n10, 1832), is thus related: \"A person named Eleanor Blucher,\r\na tall, muscular native of Prussia, and said to be distantly\r\nrelated to the late Marshal Blucher, was charged with an\r\nassault on Mary White. Both live in the same court at Ratclif,\r\nand Mrs. White having lost several articles from the yard,\r\nsuspected the defendant. She and her neighbours, after a\r\nconsultation, agreed to have recourse to the key and Bible to",
  "p2290.png": "discover the thief. They placed the street-door key on the\r\nfiftieth Psalm, closed the sacred volume, and fastened it very\r\ntightly with the garter of a female. The Bible and key were\r\nthen suspended to a nail; the prisoner's name was then repeated\r\nthree times by one of the women, while another recited the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"'If it turns to thee thou art the thief,\r\nAnd we all are free.'\r\n\r\nThe incantation being concluded, the key turned, or the\r\nwomen thought it did, and it was unanimously agreed upon in\r\nthe neighbourhood that she had stolen two pairs of inexpressibles\r\nbelonging to Mrs. White's husband, and severely\r\nbeat her.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. F. Wegener, Vestry Clerk, of St. John's, Wapping, said\r\nhe discovered his servant trying the faith of her sweetheart,\r\nnow at sea, by turning the key in the Bible at the midnight\r\nhour, a few weeks ago. Mr. Ballantine said he should have\r\nthe key turned on her without the Bible, and ordered her to be\r\nlocked up until some person would come forward and be\r\nresponsible for her future good-conduct.\"\r\n\r\nIn a number of the Pall Mall Gazette (1879) we find that\r\n\"at Southampton, a boy working on a collier was charged with\r\ntheft; the only evidence against him being such as was afforded\r\nby the ancient ordeal of Bible and key. The mate and some\r\nothers swung a Bible attached to a key, with a piece of yarn,\r\nthe key being placed on the first chapter of Ruth. While the\r\nBible was turning, several persons suspected were called over,\r\nand on the mention of the prisoner's name, the book fell on\r\nthe floor. The Bench, of course, discharged the prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the Birmingham Daily Post\r\n(January 10, 1879): \"A singular case of superstition revealed\r\nitself at the Borough Petty Sessions at Ludlow, on January 7th.\r\nA married woman named Mary Anne Collier was charged\r\nwith using abusive and insulting language to her neighbour\r\nEliza Oliver; and the complainant, in her statement to the",
  "p2300.png": "magistrate, said that on December 27 she was engaged in\r\ncarrying water, when Mrs. Collier stopped her, and stated that\r\nanother neighbour had had a sheet stolen, and had 'turned the\r\nkey on the Bible' near several houses; that when it came to her\r\n(Oliver's) house, the key moved of itself, and that when complainant's\r\nname was mentioned, the key and the book turned\r\ncompletely round, and fell out of their hands. She also stated\r\nthat the owner of the sheet then inquired from the key and\r\nthe Book whether the theft was committed at dark or at daylight,\r\nand the reply was 'Daylight.' Defendant then called\r\ncomplainant a ---- daylight thief, and charged her with stealing\r\nthe sheet. The Bench dismissed the case, the chief\r\nmagistrate expressing his astonishment that such superstition\r\nand ignorance should exist in the borough. It has been\r\nexplained by one who professed to believe in this mode of\r\ndetecting thieves, that the key is placed over the open Bible at\r\nthe words, 'Whither thou goest I will go,' Ruth. i. 16; that the\r\nfingers of the persons were held so as to form a cross, and the\r\ntext being repeated, and the suspected person named, the key\r\nbegins to jump and dance about with great violence, in such a\r\nway that no one can keep it still.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that although the book of Ruth seems to be\r\nchiefly employed in this divination, the fifth verse of the\r\nnineteenth chapter of Proverbs has its advocates. In Brand's\r\n\"Popular Antiquities\" it is stated that the key is placed on\r\nthe fiftieth Psalm.\r\n\r\nIt was considered necessary in former times that the trial of\r\nthe Bible and key should be exercised when the sun or moon\r\nwas in Virgo; the name was to be written on a key, which was\r\nthen tied to a Bible, and both were hung upon the nail of the\r\nring-finger of a virgin, who repeated thrice, softly, Exurge\r\nDomine, adjuva nos et redime nos propter nomen sanctum tuum.\r\nAccording as the key and Book turned, or was stationary, the\r\nname was considered right or wrong. Some others added the\r\nseven Psalms, with litanies and sacred prayers, that more fearful\r\neffect should be produced upon the guilty; for not only",
  "p2310.png": "the key and Book turned, but either the impression of the key\r\nwas found upon him, or he lost an eye; whence came the\r\nproverb, Ex oculo quoque excusso hodie fur cognoscitur.\r\n\r\nIn Pope's \"Memoirs of P. P., Clerk of the Parish,\" is the\r\nfollowing: \"The next chapter relates how he discovered a thief\r\nwith the Bible and key, and experimented verses of the Psalms\r\nthat had cured agues.\"\r\n\r\nDivination by Bible and key seems not merely confined to\r\nthis country, but to have extended to Asia. In the \"P\u00e9r\u00e9grinations\r\nen Orient,\" by Eusabe de Salle (1840), the author, in\r\nspeaking of his sojourn at Antioch, in the house of the English\r\nConsul, observes: \"En rentrant dans le salon, je trouvai\r\nMistress B. assise sur son divan, pr\u00e8s d'un natif Syrien\r\nChr\u00e9tien. Ils tenaient \u00e0 eux deux une Bible, suspendue \u00e0 une\r\ngrosse cl\u00e9 par un mouchoir fin. Mistress B. ne se rappelait\r\npas avoir re\u00e7u un bijou qu'un Aleppin affirmait lui avoir remis.\r\nLe Syrien disait une pri\u00e8re, puis pronon\u00e7ait alternativement les\r\nnoms de la dame et de l'Aleppin. La Bible pivota au nom de\r\nla dame d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par l\u00e0 en erreur. Elle se leva \u00e0 l'instant, et\r\nayant fait des r\u00e9cherches plus exactes, finit par trouver le\r\nbijou.\"\r\n\r\nA method was formerly practised in Russia to discover the\r\nplace of hidden treasures. A key was placed on the first page\r\nof the Gospel of St. John, taking care that the ring of the key\r\nwas passed over the pages; the book was then closed, and a\r\ncord attached to it. The person trying this mode of divination\r\nplaced the index-finger of his left hand in the ring, and\r\npronounced the names of different places in which the\r\ntreasures might be found. If the key moved on the finger\r\nthat held it, the omen was considered favourable, and a search\r\nin the place indicated was made.\r\n\r\nA singular mode of divination in which the Bible was also\r\nemployed was that by \"sieve and shears.\" In the detection of\r\na thief by this mode, Grose tells us: \"You must stick the\r\npoints of the shears in the wood of the sieve, and let two\r\npersons support it, balanced upright with their two fingers;",
  "p2320.png": "then read a certain chapter in the Bible, and afterwards ask\r\nSt. Peter and St. Paul if A. or B. is the thief, naming all the\r\npersons you suspect. On naming the real thief, the sieve will\r\nsuddenly turn round about.\"\r\n\r\nReginald Scot, in his \"Discovery of Witchcraft,\" tells us\r\nthat \"Popish priests, as the Chaldeans used the divination by\r\nsieve and shears for the detection of theft, do practise with a\r\npsalter and key fastened upon the forty-ninth Psalm to discover\r\na thief; and when the names of the suspected persons are\r\norderly put into the pipe of the key, at the reading of these\r\nwords of the Psalm, 'If thou sawest a thief thou didst consent\r\nunto him,' the book will wagg, and fall out of the fingers of\r\nthem that hold it, and he whose name remaineth in the key\r\nmust be the thief.\" Brand observes on this, that Scot has\r\nmistaken the Psalm; it is the fiftieth, and not the forty-ninth,\r\nin which the passage he has cited is found.\r\n\r\nIn 1553 Edwin Sandys, then Protestant Vice-Chancellor of\r\nCambridge, and afterwards Archbishop of York, was appointed\r\nto preach a special sermon in connection with the revolt of the\r\nfleet and army, and the presence of mutinous troops in the\r\ntown. He arose at three o'clock in the summer twilight, took\r\nhis Bible, and prayed with closed eyes that he might open at a\r\nfitting text. His eyes, when he lifted them, were resting on the\r\n16th and 17th of the first of Joshua, \"And they answered\r\nJoshua, saying, all thou commandest us we will do; and whithersoever\r\nthou sendest us we will go; according as we hearkened\r\nunto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee, only\r\nthe Lord thy God be with thee as He was with Moses.\"\r\n\r\nThe application was obvious. Edward VI. was Moses,\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland was Joshua, and if a sermon\r\ncould have saved the cause of Protestantism against Queen\r\nMary, Lady Jane Grey would have been secure upon her\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nWhen Darnley, the consort of Mary Queen of Scots, was at\r\nKirk-a-Field (February 9, 1567), the shadow of death was\r\ncreeping over him. Sorrow, suffering, disease and fear had",
  "p2330.png": "done their work. Bothwell had prepared his infernal scheme\r\nfor his murder. The king opened the prayer-book, and read\r\nover the fifty-fifth Psalm, which, by a strange coincidence,\r\nwas in the English service for the day that was dawning. These\r\nare the last words which are known to have passed the lips of\r\nMary Stuart's husband: \"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hide\r\nnot Thyself from my petition. My heart is disquieted within\r\nme, and the fear of death is fallen upon me. Fearfulness\r\nand trembling are come upon me, and an horrible dread\r\nhath overwhelmed me. It is not an open enemy that hath\r\ndone me this dishonour, for then I could have borne it. It\r\nwas even thou, my companion, my guide, and my own familiar\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nA few hours after, Darnley was foully murdered.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a work called \"Echoes to the Voice from\r\nHeaven\" (1652), that the fanatic Arise Evans, in the time of\r\nthe Commonwealth used the divination by the Bible. It seems\r\nalso from Lord Berkeley's \"Historical Applications\" (1670),\r\nthat the earl being sick and in dejection had recourse to this\r\nthen prevailing superstition. His words are, \"I being sick and\r\nunder some dejection of spirit, opening my Bible to see what\r\nplace I could first light upon, casually I fixed upon the sixth of\r\nHosea; the three first verses. I am willing to decline superstition\r\nupon all occasions, yet think myself obliged to make\r\nthis use of such a providential place of Scripture: first, by\r\nhearty repenting me of my sins past: secondly, by sincere\r\nreformation for the time to come.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Domestic Annals of Scotland,\" we read a curious\r\naccount of Bible divination under date 1682. It concerned a\r\nservant lass in the burgh of Irvine. Her mistress, the wife of\r\nthe Hon. Major Montgomery, having had some silver articles\r\nstolen, blamed the lass, who, taking the matter much amiss,\r\nand protesting her innocence, said she would learn who took\r\nthose things, though she should raise the devil for it. The\r\nmaster and mistress let this pass as a rash speech; but the girl,\r\nbeing resolute, on a certain day \"goes down to a laigh cellar,",

She puts one question\r\nto him, and he answers it; and she casts three of the feathers\r\nat him, charging him to his place again; then he disappears.\r\nHe seemed to her to rise out of the earth to the middle of his\r\nbody. She reads the same verse backward the second time,\r\nand he appears the second time, rising out of the ground, with\r\none leg above the ground; she asks him a second question,\r\nand she casts other three feathers at him, charging him to his\r\nplace; he again disappears. She reads again the third time\r\nthe verse backward, and he appears the third time with his\r\nbody above ground (the last two times in the shape of a black\r\ngrim man in black clothing, and the last time with a long tail);\r\nshe asks a third question at him, and casts the three last\r\nfeathers at him, charging him to his place, and he disappears.\r\nThe major-general and his lady, being above stairs, though not\r\nknowing what was a-working, were sore afraid, and could give\r\nno reason for it; the dogs in the city making a hideous barking\r\nround about. This done, the woman, aghast, and pale as death,\r\ncomes and tells her lady who had stolen the things she missed,\r\nand they were in such a chest in her house, belonging to some\r\nof the servants, which, being searched, was found accordingly.\r\nSome of the servants, suspecting her to be about this work, tells\r\nthe major of it, and tells him they saw her go down into the\r\ncellar; he lays her up in prison, and she confesses as has been\r\nbefore related, telling them that she learned it in Dr. Colvin's\r\nhouse in Ireland, who used to practise this.\" Fountainhall\r\nrelates this story (by Law) more briefly as a \"strange accident,\"\r\nand remarks that the divination per cibrum (by the sieve) is very\r\nancient, having been practised by the Greeks.

Wrap all these in a thin handkerchief of\r\ngauze or muslin, and on getting into bed, cross your hands\r\nand say:\r\n\r\n\"'Luna, every woman's friend,\r\nTo me thy goodness condescend;\r\nLet me this night in visions see\r\nEmblems of my destiny.'\"\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England a custom is practised on New\r\nYear's Day called \"Dipping.\" A Bible is laid on the table at\r\nbreakfast-time, and those who wish to consult it, open it at\r\nrandom, and it is supposed that the events of the ensuing year\r\nwill be in some way described by the contents of the chapter\r\ncontained in the two open pages.\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Notes and Queries\" (and series, vol. xii.)\r\nmentions a species of divination (sent him from Northamptonshire)\r\nof the leading events in a man's life, or rather of future\r\nemployment drawn from the last chapter of the Book of\r\nProverbs. This consists of thirty-one verses, each of which is\r\nsupposed to have a mystical reference to each of the corresponding\r\ndays of the month. Thus, a person born on the 14th,\r\nwill be prognosticated \"to get their food from far.\" My correspondent\r\nsays: \"This is so fully believed in by some, that a\r\nboy has actually been apprenticed to a linen-draper, for no\r\nother reason than because he was born on the 24th of the\r\nmonth; whilst those born on the 13th would be sent to a\r\nwoollen-draper. The twenty-fourth verse speaks of 'fine linen,'\r\nand the thirteenth of 'wool.'\"",

As a kindred bit of folk-lore, I may add that\r\nthe words of King Lemuel's mother, the last chapter of Proverbs,\r\nare often made to do duty in the divining line. The chapter\r\nis divided into thirty-one verses, one of which is appropriated\r\nto each day of the month; the response depends on what is\r\nthe consulter's birthday.\"\r\n\r\nCotton Mather tried one of the New Englanders said to be\r\npossessed with a spirit, by \"the Bible, the Assembly's Catechism,\r\nhis grandfather's 'Milk for Babes,' his father's 'Remarkable\r\nProvidence,' and a book to prove that there were witches,\"\r\nand whenever any of these were for the possessed woman to\r\nread in, she would be struck dead and fall into hideous convulsions.\r\nThese good books, he says, were mortal to her. To\r\nmake the case more manifest both ways, he tried her with other\r\nbooks, as Quakers' books, Popish books, the Cambridge and\r\nOxford Jests, a Prayer-book, a book written to prove that there\r\nwere no witches; and the devil would let her read these as\r\nlong as she would, and she treated the Prayer-book with particular\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nDe Foe makes Robinson Crusoe practise the Bible divination.\r\nHe knew the manners of the early Anchorets, and was\r\nprobably indebted to this source for some of his materials.\r\n\r\nTHE word Abracadabra, or Abrasadabra, of magical import,\r\nis attributed by Baronious, in his \"Annals\" (An. 120) to\r\nSerenus, a celebrated physician in the third century, who was\r\nalso a follower of the heretic Basilides.

The principal of them was \"Agla,\" and when disposed\r\nof in two triangles, intersecting one another, was called \"the\r\nshield of David;\" supposed to be an amulet against wounds,\r\nand to have the power of extinguishing fire, etc. Agla, or\r\nAlga, arranged thus A|L/G|A became a medi\u00e6val exorcism.\r\nThe custom of wearing some phrase, or cabalistic[*] combination\r\nof letters, either inscribed on parchment, or paper, or more\r\nindelibly affixed to rings, and other personal ornaments, is of\r\nconsiderable antiquity. Its origin may, probably, be traced\r\nto the Gnostics (from the Greek gnosis, knowledge), the collective\r\nterm for a number of early Christian sects, which were\r\nknown by especial names derived from their founders, and to\r\nthe legends in the strange devices under the name \"Abraxas,\"\r\na species of amulet so called from having that word, in which\r\nheathen and Christian allusions are strangely confounded\r\ntogether.

By these means they\r\nextracted senses from the sacred oracles, very different from those which\r\nthe expression seemed naturally to impart or which were ever intended by\r\nthe authors. Under the sanction of ancient names, many fictitious writings\r\nwere produced, which greatly contributed to the spread of this mystical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[An account of the Cabalistic art, as practised not only by Jews, but by\r\nheathens and Christians, is in Basnage's \"History of the Jews.\"]",

They marked whatever irregularities were found in\r\nany of the letters of the Hebrew text; as that in some words,\r\none letter is of a larger (Deut. iv. 4), in others of a less (Gen. ii. 4)\r\nsize than the rest. Of the former sort they discovered 31 instances,\r\nof the latter 33. They observed four words in which\r\none letter was suspended, or placed somewhat higher than the\r\nrest (Judges xviii. 30); nine places in which the letter nun is\r\ninverted (Numb. x. 35), and several places where the final\r\nletters are not used at the end of words; and others, where\r\nthey are used in the middle. They were very fruitful in finding\r\nout reasons for these irregularities and mysteries in them.\r\n\r\nWhat were called the Prenestine lots were used in Italy. The\r\nletters of the alphabet were placed in an urn and shaken; they\r\nwere then turned out on the floor, and the words which they\r\naccidentally formed were received as omens.\r\n\r\nThis superstitious use of letters is still common in Eastern\r\nnations. The Mussulmans have a divining table, which they\r\nsay was invented by the prophet Edris, or Enoch. It is divided\r\ninto a hundred little squares, each of which contains a letter of\r\nthe Arabic alphabet.

A wheat-corn was then placed on every letter\r\nbeginning with A, during which the depositor repeated this\r\nverse, \"Ecce enim veritatem,\" etc. This was done when the\r\nsun and moon were in Aries or Leo. A young white cock\r\nwas then taken, his claws cut off, and these he was forced to\r\nswallow with a little scroll of parchment made of lambskin,\r\nupon which was an inscription. The diviner, holding the cock,\r\nrepeated, \"O Deus Creator omnium, qui firmamentum pulchritudine\r\nstellarum form\u00e2sti, constituens eas in signa et tempora,\r\ninfunde virtutem tuam operibus nostris, ut per opus in eis consequamur\r\neffectum.\" Next, on placing the cock within the\r\ncircle, two verses of the Psalms were repeated: \"Domine,\r\ndilexi decorem dom\u00fbs tu\u00e6 et locum habitationis tu\u00e6. Domine\r\nDeus virtutum, converte nos et ostende faciem tuam, et salvi\r\ncrimus.\" These are exactly the midmost of the seventy-two\r\nverses mentioned in the practice of Onimancy, or the observation\r\nof the Angel Uriel; and it is to be noted on the authority\r\nof an ancient rabbi, that there is nothing in these seventy-two\r\nwhich is not of some use in the cabalistical secret. The cock\r\nbeing within the circle, it was requisite to observe from what\r\nletters he pecked the grains, and upon those others were placed,\r\nbecause some names and words contained the same letters\r\ntwice or thrice. These letters were written down and put\r\ntogether, and these were supposed to reveal the name of the\r\nperson concerning whom inquiry had been made. It is said,\r\nthough the story is doubted, that the magician Jamblicus used\r\nthis art to discover the person who should succeed Valens\r\nC\u00e6sar in the empire, but the bird picking up but four of the\r\ngrains, those which lay on the letters left it uncertain whether\r\nTheodosius, Theodotus, Theodorus, or Theodectes were the",

He had been a Benedictine monk, but on the\r\nsuppression of the monasteries in 1790, the poor priest took\r\nrefuge in Paris, where, at the age of seventy, with no other resources\r\nto exist upon but his wits, he availed himself of his\r\nknowledge of mathematics and astronomy to draw horoscopes,\r\nand foretell the future to those who were connected directly or\r\nremotely in the Revolution. As a priest, of which he had the\r\nunmistakable appearance, he ran great risk during the sanguinary\r\nevents of that period; but as he contrived to colour his\r\npredictions with praises of the Convention, and with victories\r\nto be gained by the French armies, he was considered in the\r\nlight of a patriot, and escaped the scaffold.\r\n\r\nPierre le Clerc had some notable visitors to his prophetic\r\ns\u00e9ances; amongst others Philip of Orleans, Charlotte Corday,\r\nRobespierre, and, later, Bonaparte, then general.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans had voted for the death of the king.\r\nHe was bitterly reproached for this cowardice.

A short time after the fearful tragedy of January 21, he\r\nheard of the prophecies of Pierre le Clerc, and went privately to\r\nconsult him as to the future of events. At first the priest refused\r\nto satisfy his curiosity, but was at length persuaded to try\r\nhis art. \"Your highness,\" he said, \"received at your birth the\r\ntitle of Duke of Montpensier?\" \"Yes, and with the names of\r\nLouis Philippe Joseph. I became Duke of Orleans by hereditary\r\nright.\" \"Your lordship has also publicly received the\r\nsurname of \u00c9galit\u00e9?\" \"Yes; it is an arm of defence in these\r\ntimes.\" \"Then the union of the signs of your individuality\r\npast and present, is Louis Philippe Joseph, Duke de Montpensier--Duke\r\nof Orleans--\u00c9galit\u00e9, Deputy to the National\r\nConvention of the French Republic.\"\r\n\r\nPierre le Clerc then revealed to the prince the method he\r\npursued in his divination by words, and then added, in a trembling\r\nvoice, \"This is the lot of your destiny. The scaffold\r\nthat he voted for the falling king will soon become his fate.\r\nGod ordains his equality by sharing the same punishment.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the Duke of Orleans turned pale, and shuddered.\r\n\"There remain,\" continued Pierre, \"upon the circle\r\nsix mute letters, P, J, P, P, P, A, which signify Pari Jure, Proscripto,\r\nPrincipi Proscriptus \u00c6quatur; that is to say, by the\r\nlaw of requital the proscription equals that of the prince proscribed.\r\nAh! my lord, this name of \u00c9galit\u00e9 and this Convention\r\nhave brought you misfortune; but God, who has thus\r\npermitted us to meet, affords you the means of safety. Fly at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend,\" replied the duke, \"I shall remain. A\r\nprince of the House of Orleans is not afraid of peril. Men\r\nmay kill me, but God only can judge me.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months later the judgment was given, and the duke\r\nperished on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Corday, on her visit to Pierre le Clerc, attracted\r\nhis sympathy by her interesting manners and appearance. He\r\nthought her mission must relate to some love affair, and said,",
  "p2460.png": "consolingly, \"No maiden leaves my poor apartment without\r\ncarrying with her a smile of Providence. I do not wish to\r\nknow anything of your secrets, but I will tell you the result of\r\nmy researches with strict truth.\" A number of plain cards\r\nwere then placed before her, and she was desired to write on\r\neach the letters of the Christian name and surname of the person\r\nfor whom the future was to be consulted. The cards were\r\nthen mixed together, and after due observation the priest gave\r\nthe following result: \"The 13th of July, 1793, Charlotte de\r\nCorday d'Armont will attempt to kill at Paris, with a knife,\r\nJean Paul Marat, Deputy to the National Convention of the\r\nFrench Republic.\" From these letters, traced on as many\r\ncards by Charlotte Corday, and mixed together, the priest, after\r\na careful study of ten minutes, selected six bearing the letters\r\nL, Z, C, R, A, A. Suddenly Pierre put all the cards together,\r\nas if to render the answer to them impossible, and said, with an\r\nair of discouragement, \"Are you sure that you have made no\r\nerror in what you have written?\" \"None,\" replied Charlotte\r\nCorday. \"Then let me give you a lesson in prudence. Tell\r\nyour friend, whoever it may be, not to go to that powerful\r\nminister.\" \"Why?\" \"I give you,\" returned the priest, \"the\r\nbest example of prudence by keeping silence.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Pierre le Clerc could not have entrusted to a stranger\r\nthe fearful reply that his divination had evoked, which was\r\n\"The mortal blow in thy breast ought to kill thee at Paris,\r\nin the bath, livid Marat. The scaffold is the pedestal where\r\nthe martyr, crowned with heroic glory, hovers over the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThe six mute letters L, Z, C, R, A, A, signified \"Lividi\r\nZona Cruoris Rubefacit Amplexantem, Aquam,\" or, \"A circle\r\nof livid blood reddens the water that holds the corpse.\" This\r\nhad relation to the bath in which Marat was assassinated.\r\n\r\nThe visit of Robespierre to the priest was of some duration.\r\nThe result of the divinatory cards ran thus: \"A Republican\r\nrare, inflexible; he will die on the scaffold, in the name of the\r\nnation, by vote of his enemies.\"",
  "p2470.png": "\r\nThere remained six mute letters, A, I, E, E, O, Q, signifying,\r\n\"Ab Iniquis Eversus, Extortus, Odio, Quiritum,\" or,\r\n\"Overthrown by the league of the wicked, tortured by the hate\r\nof the citizens.\" This was verified by the events of 1794.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1795 that Bonaparte, deprived of his command by\r\nthe Council of War, vegetated at Paris, a prey to discouragement\r\nand ennui. Hearing of Pierre le Clerc, he went one day\r\nto see him, merely as a means of passing away his time. He\r\nfound the philosopher busied on some horoscope, and seeing\r\nthe table covered with hieroglyphics and mathematical calculations,\r\nhe determined on trying his chance. On being required\r\nto give the date of his birth, he made no objection; but on\r\nbeing asked his name and profession, he thought some jugglery-trick\r\nwas to be practised, and abruptly rose to leave. \"You\r\nare wrong,\" observed the priest, \"to doubt my art. I know\r\nmore than you probably imagine. There was a prophecy of a\r\ncertain Count de Cagliostro uttered ten years ago, on the\r\nFrench Revolution, which was not then thought of. This\r\nannounced that a Corsican, voted, or elected, by the people,\r\nwould finish it, probably by a dictatorship. This would be a\r\nfine opening for you, seeing that you are a Corsican, and you\r\nmight probably learn something of your future career.\"\r\nBonaparte, however, thought he had to do with an old madman\r\nor quack, and throwing some silver on the table, quitted the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nFour years afterwards (November 8, 1799), the eve of the\r\nfamous day known under the name of the 18th Brumaire, the\r\ngeneral set aside under the Convention, had become, under\r\nthe Directory, the favourite of that fortune he had disdained to\r\nconsult. Covered with the laurels of Italy and Egypt, and the\r\nincarnation of Victory, everything seemed to place itself under\r\nhis feet. He thought of Pierre le Clerc, and went secretly to\r\nhave an interview with him. It was evening, and the priest\r\ndid not recognise him. Nothing was changed in the apartment,\r\nexcept that everything showed that the philosopher who\r\nforetold honours and riches to others, had become himself",
  "p2480.png": "more miserably poor than ever. His clients had deserted him.\r\nGiving him some money, Bonaparte asked him abruptly\r\nwhether he could resolve an important question at once. \"By\r\nthe horoscope, no, for that requires considerable time; but by\r\nword divination, yes; provided the interrogation is complete,\r\nand without any equivocation.\" \"But,\" returned Bonaparte,\r\n\"if this question is of a secret and delicate character; if, for\r\nexample, it was asked by a woman, having the desire for it to\r\nbe unknown, even to her confessor?\" \"Well,\" observed the\r\npriest, \"this woman would keep her secret. The question\r\nshould contain the names, Christian and surnames, position\r\nand qualities of the party seeking the revelation; and, besides,\r\nthe subject or object, clearly explained, of the inquiry into the\r\noracle. This text contains a certain number of letters, which\r\nshould be written on so many cards; these are afterwards\r\nmixed promiscuously; I then take them; arrange them in a\r\ncircle, asking only whether it concerns a man or a woman, and\r\nby patient study, I find the oracle. Take a pen, and write on\r\nno more cards than are necessary.\r\n\r\nBonaparte wrote rapidly the question on 119 cards, each\r\ncontaining a single letter, mixed them together, and gave them\r\nto the priest, who arranged them in a circle, and formed the\r\nquestion thus: \"What will become of the Corsican Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, general, on account of the Coup d'\u00c9tat risked by\r\nhim at Paris, the 18th Brumaire, 1799?\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" observed Pierre, after a short interval, \"you\r\nspoke to me just now of some woman's secret, but I find\r\nnothing feminine in what I contemplate. Whatever may be the\r\nquestion, or the person to whom it alludes, I will tell you\r\nwhat I read in these 119 letters: 'En mil huit cent quatre, il\r\nmontera sur la tr\u00f4ne \u00e0 pique; puis, coup\u00e9 en dix et un, sera\r\nrenvers\u00e9 par la canonade du soldat d'Angleterre.\"\r\n\r\nThe word tr\u00f4ne, and the date 1804, appeared to surprise\r\nBonaparte, but he remained unmoved, and it was in a tone of\r\nindifference that he asked what might signify the two enigmas,\r\n\"Tr\u00f4ne \u00e0 pique, et coup\u00e9 en dix et un?\"",
  "p2490.png": "\r\n\"The oracles,\" replied the priest, \"have often a meaning\r\nthat is not recognised until the event has occurred. However,\r\nI see in the image of the tr\u00f4ne \u00e0 pique a kind of military display,\r\na power surrounded by C\u00e6sarian standards. The other\r\nenigma is a number marking a division of time; ten and one\r\nunite in eleven, and eleven added to 1804, fixes on 1815, the\r\ndangerous apparition of the English soldier. But this is merely\r\na supposition. Of the 119 letters which your question\r\ncomprise, thirteen are mute, B, O, P, P, I, A, I, B, I, P, A, U, F,\r\nand which, nevertheless, ought to reveal. The ancient augurs\r\nwould have considered them as the initials of a complementary\r\nsolution, and, in reality, these initials become thirteen Latin\r\nwords, which announce equally, elevation and downfall: Bis\r\nOriens, Populi Princeps, In Altum Incedit; Bis Incidit; Per\r\nAnglos Ultima Fata, or, \"He rises twice, prince of the people,\r\nand hovers over the heights; twice he falls; his last fatality\r\nwill come from the English.\"\r\n\r\nBonaparte appeared struck with this result of the oracle, and\r\nto prove the further experience of the priest, he requested a\r\nsecond trial of his skill, and wrote upon sixty-nine cards the\r\nfollowing letters: 'Josephine--Marie--Rose de Tascher de la\r\nPagerie, wife of the General Napoleon Bonaparte.\" He then\r\nmixed them together, and placed the cards before the priest,\r\nsaying: \"Remember, it concerns a lady in whom a certain\r\nperson takes a great interest.\"\r\n\r\nPierre le Clerc arranged the cards according to his usual\r\nmethod, and in a short time interpreted the letters as \"too\r\nold;--the imperial diadem worn on his second marriage will\r\nnot bring good fortune.\" This was too much for the general,\r\nwho went away greatly disappointed. There remained, however,\r\nthree mute letters, H, E, A, which the priest made out to\r\nsignify \"Herois Extinctus Amor,\" that is, \"Love extinguishes\r\nitself in the heart of a hero.\" The reader of history will be\r\nable to interpret these various oracles by the course of events\r\nwhich followed.

It says, Marb\u0153uf\r\nwas the first to recognise the genius of Napoleon I. at the\r\nMilitary College. Marengo was the first great battle won by\r\nGeneral Bonaparte, and Melas made room for him in Italy.\r\nMortier was one of his best generals, Moreau betrayed him,\r\nand Marat was the first martyr to his cause. Marie Louise\r\nshared his highest fortunes; Moscow was the abyss of ruin\r\ninto which he fell. Metternich vanquished him in the field of\r\ndiplomacy. Six marshals (Massena, Mortier, Marmont,\r\nMacdonald, Murat, Moncey) and twenty-six generals of\r\ndivision under Napoleon I. had the letter 'M' for their initial.\r\nMarat, Duke of Bassano, was his most trusted counsellor.\r\nHis first battle was that of Montenotte, his last, Mont St. Jean,\r\nas the French term Waterloo. He won the battles of\r\nMillesimo, Mondovi, Montmirail, and Montereau; then came\r\nthe storming of Montmartre. Milan was the first enemy's\r\ncapital, and Moscow the last, into which he entered victorious.\r\nHe lost Egypt through Menou, and employed Miellis to take\r\nPius VII. prisoner. Mallet conspired against him; Murat was\r\nthe first to desert him, then Marmont. Three of his ministers\r\nwere Maret, Montalivet, and Mallieu; his first chamberlain\r\nwas Montesquieu. His last halting-place in France was\r\nMalmaison. He surrendered to Captain Maitland of the\r\nBellerophon, and his companions at St. Helena were Montholon\r\nand his valet Marchand.\"",

His empress was a\r\nCountess Montijo; his greatest friend was Morny. The taking\r\nof the Malakoff and the Mamelon-vert were the exploits of the\r\nCrimean war, peculiarly French. He planned his first battle\r\nof the Italian campaign at Marengo, although it was not fought\r\nuntil after the engagement at Montebello, at Magenta. MacMahon\r\nfor his important services in this battle, was named\r\nDuke of Magenta, as Pelissier had for a similar merit obtained\r\nthe title of Duke of Malakoff. Napoleon III. then made his\r\nentry into Milan, and drove the Austrians out of Marignano.\r\nAfter the fearful battle on the Mincio of Solferino, he turned\r\nback before the walls of Mantua. Thus up to 1859; since\r\nwhen the letter M would seem to have been ominous of evil.\r\nPassing over Mexico and Maximilian, we see how vain have\r\nbeen his hopes, founded on the three M's of the present war--Marshal\r\nMacMahon, Count Montauban, and Mitrailleuse!\r\nMayence was to have been the basis for the further operations\r\nof the French army, but pushed back, first to the Moselle, its\r\ndoom was sealed on the Mans, at Sedan.

In some respects by the transposition of\r\nletters, it assumed a kind of divination of prophetical import\r\nCamden, in his \"Remains,\" calls the difficilis que pulchra, the\r\ncharming difficulty of making an anagram, \"a whetstone of\r\npatience to them that shall practise it; for some have been\r\nseen to bite their pen, scratch their heads, bend their brows,\r\nbite their lips, beat the board, tear their paper, when the names\r\nwere fair for somewhat, and caught nothing therein.\"",
  "p2520.png": "\r\nAddison relates a humorous account of an anagrammatist,\r\nwho, after shutting himself up for half a year, and taking many\r\nliberties with the name of his mistress, discovered, on presenting\r\nhis anagram, that he had mis-spelt her surname. He was so\r\nthunderstruck with his misfortune, that in a little time after he\r\nlost his senses.\r\n\r\nCamden seems to refer the origin of the anagram to the time\r\nof Moses, and conceives that it might have formed some share\r\nin the mystical traditions, afterwards called Cabala, communicated\r\nby that divine lawgiver to the chosen seventy. Another\r\nwriter on this subject observes that the Cabalists among the\r\nJews were professed anagrammatists; the third part of their art,\r\nwhich they called themuru, that is, \"changing,\" being nothing\r\nbut the art of making anagrams, or of finding the hidden and\r\nmystical meaning in names, which they did by transposing,\r\nchanging, and differently combining the letters of those names.\r\nThus of the letters of Noah's name in Hebrew, they made\r\ngrace; and of the Messiah, they made He shall rejoice.\r\n\r\nThe prophetical character of the anagram found many\r\nbelievers in ancient, and even up to later times; a few instances\r\nmust suffice. A work on various subjects mentions\r\none on James I. \"Charles James Stuart--claims Arthur's\r\nseat.\" \"And this,\" says the author gravely, \"shows his\r\nundoubted rightful claim to the monarchy of Britain as successor\r\nto the valorous King Arthur!\" This anagram was the\r\nproduction of Dr. Walter Gwyn, who--as appears from a note\r\nto one of Owen's epigrams--published a collection of these jeux\r\nd'esprit. It further appears from Owen's note that the anagram\r\nwas written previously to the actual occurrence of the event\r\nwhich it seemed to indicate. Lady Eleanor Davies (wife of the\r\ncelebrated poet) made great pretensions to be considered a\r\nprophetess; as her predictions in the troubled times of Charles\r\nI. were usually against the government, she was at length\r\nbrought into the high court of commission. The prophetess\r\nwas not a little mad, and fancied the spirit of Daniel was in her,\r\nfrom an anagram she had formed of her name, \"Eleanor",
  "p2530.png": "Davies: Reveal, O Daniel!\" The anagram had too much by\r\nan l, and too little by an s, yet Daniel and Reveal were in it,\r\nand that was sufficient to satisfy her inspirations. The court\r\nattempted to expel the spirit from the lady, but the bishops\r\nreasoned the point with her out of the Scriptures, to no purpose;\r\nshe, poising text upon text, \"until one of the Deans of the\r\nArches,\" says Heylin, \"shot her through and through with an\r\narrow borrowed from her own quiver.\" Taking up a pen, he\r\nhit upon this excellent anagram, \"Dame Eleanor Davies:\r\nNever so mad a ladie.\" This happy thought put the solemn\r\ncourt into good humour, and the prophetess into great dejection.\r\n\r\nAn amusing instance is mentioned of changing a profession\r\nby an \"anagram\" superstition. Andrew Rudiger, a physician\r\nof Leipsic, took it into his head to form an anagram on his\r\nname; and in the words Andreas Rudigerus, he found a vocation,\r\nnamely, \"Arare rus Dei dignus.\" Thereupon he concluded\r\nthat he was called to the priesthood, and began to study\r\ntheology. Soon after he became tutor to the children of the\r\nlearned Thomasius. This philosopher one day told him that\r\nhe had much better apply himself to medicine. Rudiger\r\nadmitted his inclination to that profession, but stated that the\r\nanagram of his name, which he explained to Thomasius, had\r\nseemed to him a divine vocation to the priesthood. \"What a\r\nsimpleton you are!\" said Thomasius; \"why 'tis the very\r\nanagram of your name that calls you to medicine. Rus Dei, is\r\nnot that the burial ground? And who ploughs it better than\r\nthe doctors?\" In effect Rudiger turned doctor, unable to resist\r\nthe interpretation of his anagram.\r\n\r\nTHE letter Y is called the letter of Pythagoras, because\r\nthat philosopher made it the symbol of life. The foot\r\nof the letter, he said, represented infancy, and as man gradually\r\nrises to the age of reason, he finds two paths set before him,\r\nthe one leading to good, the other to evil, pourtrayed by the\r\ntwo forks of the letter.\r\n\r\nThe Pythagorean Y forms part of the symbolic decoration of",
  "p2540.png": "a carved mirror frame in the museum at South Kensington, an\r\nexquisite specimen of Italian work of the sixteenth century.\r\nAt the base is a tuft of Acanthus leaves, into which is set a\r\nlarge letter Y, from which, on each side, springs an acanthus\r\nscroll running to the top; and at their juncture is the device\r\nof a flaming grenade, on one side of which is the recording\r\nangel, on the other a human skeleton. Within the scroll are\r\nvarious animals, symbolic of the virtues; others on the left\r\nrepresenting the vices of human nature. Each animal is accompanied\r\nby a capital letter, picked out in gold, forming the\r\nwords Bonum Malum.\r\n\r\nThe following letter intended to honour the Virgin Mother,\r\nis given in a \"Short Relation of the River Nile\" (1672). The\r\nwriter says: \"Eating some dates with an old man, but a\r\ncredulous Christian, he said: 'that the letter O remained on\r\nthe stone of a date for a remembrance that our Blessed Lady,\r\nthe Virgin, with her divine Babe in her arms, resting herself at\r\nthe foot of a palm-tree (which inclined her branches, and\r\noffered a cluster of dates to her Creator), our Lady plucked\r\nsome of the dates, and eating them, satisfied with the taste and\r\nflavour, cried out in amazement: \"Oh! how sweet they are!\"\r\nThis exclamation engraved the letter O, the first word of her\r\nspeech, upon the date-stone, which, being very hard, preserved\r\nit.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following charm was taken from a German soldier\r\nduring the late war, and brought over to England by an English\r\nsurgeon. In a lecture which he delivered at Cambridge,\r\nhe said that the charm was worn and firmly believed in by\r\na large number of German soldiers. The words were copied\r\nfrom a photograph of the original, and a brief account and\r\nsummary of the German is given in \"Notes and Queries.\"\r\n\r\nThe charm came down from God in 1724, and hovered about\r\nsome representation of the Baptism of Mary Magdalene, in\r\nHolstein, refusing to be caught, until 1791, when some person\r\nhad the happy thought to copy it as it hovered. The essence of\r\nthe charm seems to consist in the letters L, T, L, K, H, B, K, N, K,",

Whoever wears the charm need have no fear of thieves\r\nand murderers, swords, or fire-arms of any sort, neither will he\r\nreceive injury from storm, fire, water, or any assault of the Evil\r\nOne, nor will he be taken prisoner. No bullet will strike him,\r\nbe it of gold, silver, or lead. Whoever doubts this may hang\r\nthe charm round a dog's neck, and shoot at him; he will find\r\nthat he cannot hit him. The greater part of the charm, however,\r\nconsists of pious exhortations couched in Biblical language,\r\nthreats of evil to those who disbelieve in it, and promises a\r\nreward to those who believe in it, and do what it enjoins. It concludes\r\nwith a tale bearing witness of its efficacy, and well calculated\r\nto inspire with confidence a superstitious soldier. A\r\ncertain count in Schleswig-Holstein had a servant, who had\r\ngiven himself up in his father's stead to have his head cut\r\noff. The executioner stood up to perform his office, when\r\nlo, and behold, his sword was powerless in his hands! The\r\ncount seeing this, asked the servant how it was that the sword\r\ndid him no harm, and the servant showed him the charm with\r\nits mystical letters. Whereupon the count gave orders that\r\neveryone should wear this charm about him.[*]\r\n\r\n* With regard to the superstition of certain words rendering the body\r\ninvulnerable, Mr. Thoms remarks that in Gr\u00fcbner's[** Gr\u00e4bner's] \"Bilder der Wunderkunst,\"\r\nit is stated that this amulet, or talisman (commonly known as the\r\nPassauish Art), was first communicated to the German soldiers, who were\r\nquartered at Passau in 1611, by the hangman of the town, who gave them\r\nscraps of paper to swallow, inscribed with the mystical words and signs,\r\n\"Arios: Beji, Glaigi, Ulpke, nalat, nasala, eri lupie,\" and which, in the\r\nbelief of the credulous, enabled them, under the command of the Archduke\r\nMatthias, to defeat the ill-paid and dispirited forces of his brother,\r\nthe Emperor Rudolph II.\r\n\r\nGr\u00fcbner[** Gr\u00e4bner] mentions that a Jew once presented himself before Duke\r\nAlbrecht, of Saxony, and offered him a charm (A nop[** \"Knopf\" in Gr\u00e4bner, p. 205]), engraved with rare\r\nsigns and characters, which should render him invulnerable. The duke\r\ndetermined to try it, had the Jew led out in the field, with his charm\r\nhanging round his neck; he then drew his sword, and at the first thrust\r\nran the Jew through.",

In\r\nestimating these doctrines it must be remembered that all movement,\r\nproportion, time, and, indeed, all idea of quantity and\r\nharmony may be represented by numbers: hence, whatever may\r\nbe attributed to the latter, may also be expressed by numbers,\r\nas the signs of occult virtues and laws. It is known to philosophers\r\nthat the movements of nature are rhythmical; physicians\r\nhave observed this in the periodicity of diseases; and\r\nthe appointment of the seventh day as a Sabbath has added\r\na religious obligation to this law of nature. The three, the\r\nten, and the twelve, are also numbers of well-known import, and\r\none is the most divine of all, as expressing the unity of God, and\r\nthe comprehension of all things in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nThe use of numbers in divination has assumed many curious\r\nforms. It may suffice to mention the Gematria, or first division\r\nof the Cabala, which teaches how to cast up the letters of particular\r\nwords, as numerals, and to form conclusions from the\r\nportion between the sum of one text and the sum of another.\r\nThis method converts the Bible into a book written solely by\r\nnumbers, and some curious results are obtained.\r\n\r\nSome singular properties of perfect, amicable, and other numbers\r\nhave been elucidated by the late Platonist, Thomas Taylor.",
  "p2570.png": "The most valuable remains of antiquity connected with the subject\r\nare contained in the \"Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster.\"\r\n\r\nThe notion that an analogy existed between men's names\r\nand their fortunes is supposed to have originated with the\r\nPythagoreans; it furnished some reveries to Plato, and has\r\nbeen the source of much small wit in Ausonius. Two leading\r\nrules in what was called Onomancy were first, that an\r\neven number of vowels in a man's name signified something\r\namiss in his left side; an uneven number a similar affection in\r\nthe right; so that between the two, perfect sanity was little to\r\nbe expected. Secondly, of two competitors, that one would\r\nprove successful the numeral letters in whose name, when\r\nsummed up, exceeded the amount of those in the name of his\r\nrival; and this was one of the reasons which enabled Achilles\r\nto triumph over Hector.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic king, Theodoric, is said, on the authority of\r\nC\u00e6lius Rhodoginus, to have practised a peculiar species of\r\nOnomancy on the recommendation of a Jew, and the story\r\nis alluded to by Camden. The diviner asked the prince, when\r\non the eve of a war with Rome, to shut up thirty hogs in\r\nthree different sties, having previously given some of them\r\nRoman and others Gothic names. On an appointed day,\r\nwhen the sties were opened, all the Romans were found alive,\r\nbut with half their bristles fallen off--all the Goths, on the\r\nother hand, were dead; and from this prognostic the diviner\r\nforeboded that the Gothic army would be utterly destroyed by\r\nthe Romans, who, at the same time, would lose half their\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nTHE Bedui, a people found in the interior of Bantam,\r\nJava, have a superstitious notion of the number one.\r\nIt is an established rule among them to allot but one day for\r\neach of the different successive operations of husbandry; one\r\nday for cutting down the trees and underwood; one day for\r\nclearing what has been so cut down; one day for sowing the\r\ngrain; one for weeding the field; and one for reaping; one",
  "p2580.png": "for binding up the grain; one for carrying it home. If any\r\npart of what has been reaped cannot be carried home in one\r\nday, it is left and neglected.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient Trinitarian doctrine on record is that of\r\nthe Brahmins. The eternal Supreme Essence, called Parrabrahma,\r\nBrehm, Paratma, produced the universe by self-reflection,\r\nand first revealed himself as Brahma, the Creating Power,\r\nthen as Vishnu, the Preserving Power, and lastly as Shiva, the\r\nDestroying and Renovating Power. According to the popular\r\nbelief, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are three distinct deities;\r\nwhereas the sages who framed the higher doctrines of the Vedas\r\nmerely regarded them as the three modes in which the Supreme\r\nEssence reveals himself in the material universe. Payne\r\nKnight remarks that \"this tri-form division of the personified\r\nattributes, or modes of action of one first cause, seems to have\r\nbeen the first departure from simple theism, and the foundation\r\nof religious mythology in every part of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn ancient mythology Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, the\r\nHellenic Trinity, are represented with a triform[** tri-form above] symbol;\r\nJupiter with the tripartite, or three-forked lightning; Neptune\r\nwith the trident; and Pluto with the tricephalic, or three-headed\r\ndog, Cerberus.\r\n\r\nIn the Scandinavian Eddas we have a Trinitarian doctrine\r\nn[** in??] Har, Jafuhar[** Jafnar?], and Thridi. Adam of Bremen describes the\r\nstatues of Odin (Woden), Thor, and Frey (Frico), as being\r\nplaced in the temple of Upsal on three thrones, one above the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"It was\" (observes Mr. Max M\u00fcller in the \"Hibbert Lectures,\"\r\n1878) \"a very old conception of life in India, that each\r\nman is born a debtor; that he owes a debt, first, to the sages,\r\nthe founders, and fathers of his religion; secondly, to the gods;\r\nthirdly, to his parents.\" After having paid these three debts a\r\nman is considered free of this world\r\n\r\nThe Babylonians attached to each of their gods a special\r\nmystic number, which is used as his emblem, and may even\r\nstand for his name in an inscription. To the gods of the first",
  "p2590.png": "Triad--Anil, Bel, and Hea, or Hoa--were assigned respectively\r\nthe numbers 60, 50, and 40; to those of the second Triad--the\r\nMoon, the Sun, and the Atmosphere--were given the other\r\nintegers, 30, 20, and 10 (or perhaps six). To Beltis was attached\r\nthe number 15; to Nergal, 12; to Bar, or Nin (apparently), 40,\r\nas to Hoa; but this is perhaps a mistake. It is probable that\r\nevery god, or at any rate all the principal deities, had in a similar\r\nway some numerical emblem.\r\n\r\nIn \"Ceremonies, Customs, Rites, and Traditions of the\r\nJews,\" etc., by Hyam Isaacs, it is stated that \"the Talmud\r\ngives the reason why the first man was called Adam. In\r\nEnglish, the word is spelt in four letters, but in Hebrew it is\r\nspelt in three letters, A, D, M. It says, God did ordain that\r\nthe world should last as long as He sees good. The first man\r\nthat was created was called Adam; the second man, who was a\r\nman after God's own heart, was called David; and the last\r\nman that ever will be born will be the Messiah. The first\r\ninitial stands A for Adam; the second, D for David; and M\r\nfor Messiah, which they say is the foundation, or reason, why\r\nthe first man was called Adam.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baalim of the Scriptures were the three sons of Noah.\r\nAs all mankind proceeded from the three families, of which\r\nthe patriarch was the head, we find this circumstance frequently\r\nalluded to by the ancient mythologists. The three persons\r\nwho first constituted these families were looked upon both as\r\ndeities and kings. They were the royal triad.\r\n\r\nThe Rosicrucians taught that there were three ascending\r\nhierarchies of angels, the Terephim, the Seraphim, and the\r\nCherubim. Three great worlds above, Empyr\u00e6um, \u00c6ther\u00e6um,\r\nand the Elementary region. The three most celebrated\r\nemblems carried in the Greek mysteries were the Phallus, the\r\nEgg, and the Serpent.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Triads, there were three baptismal bards of\r\nthe Isle of Britain--Taleisin, Merddin Emrys, and Merddin.\r\nThere were three circles of existence--the all-enclosing circle,\r\nwhich contains the Deity alone; the circle of felicity, the abode",
  "p2600.png": "of the good; the circle of evil. All animated beings have\r\nthree states of existence to pass through--the state of evil,\r\nthe state of freedom in the human form, and the state of love,\r\nwhich is happiness in heaven. Three things plunged a man\r\nback into the changes of evil--pride, falsehood, and cruelty.\r\nThere have been three languages--the first, that which Adam\r\nspoke in Paradise; the second, that of the prophet Moses when\r\nhe passed through the Red Sea; the third is that of the Cymry,\r\nwhich was that of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, who was\r\nthe first man born after the expulsion of Adam from Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe peripatetic philosophy, which governed the schools in\r\nthe time of our old dramatists, assigns to every man three souls--the\r\nvegetative, the animal, and the rational; thus in Shakspeare\r\n(\"Twelfth Night,\" ii. 3), we read: \"Shall we rouse the\r\nnight owl with a catch, that will draw three souls out of one\r\nweaver.\" And in Ben Jonson (\"Poetast,\" v. 3): \"What, will I\r\nturn shark upon my friends or my friends' friends? I scorn it\r\nwith my three souls.\"\r\n\r\nIn Huarte's \"Trials of Wit,\" translated by Carew, there is a\r\ncurious chapter concerning these three souls. This is mentioned\r\nby Dr. Farmer. \"After the forty-fifth day of conception,\" says\r\nHowell, \"the embryon is animated with three souls--with that\r\nof plants, called the vegetable soul; then with a sensitive, which\r\nall brute animals have; and, lastly, the rational soul is infused,\r\nand these three in man are like Trigonus in Tetragono.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a curious poem on the subject of the Three Souls\r\nin man, which reside respectively in the Brain, the Heart, and\r\nthe Liver, printed in \"Treatises on Popular Science,\" by\r\nWright.\r\n\r\nMany tri-foliated plants have been held sacred from a remote\r\nantiquity. The trefoil was eaten by the horses of Jupiter, and\r\na golden, three-leaved, immortal plant, affording riches and\r\nprotection, is noticed in Homer's Hymn, in Mercurium. In the\r\npalaces of Nineveh, and on the medals of Rome, representations\r\nof triple branches, triple leaves, and triple fruit are to be\r\nfound. On the temples and pyramids of Gibel-el-Birkel, con-*",
  "p2610.png": "*sidered to be much older than those of Egypt, there are representations\r\nof a tri-leaved plant which, in the illustrations of\r\nHoskins's \"Travels in Ethiopia,\" seem to be nothing else than\r\na shamrock. The triad is still a favourite figure in national\r\nand heraldic emblems.\r\n\r\nZoroaster remodelled the institute of the Magi, dividing it\r\ninto three great classes--learners, masters, and perfect scholars.\r\nThe ancients considered three as \"the perfect harmony.\" Most\r\nnations attach some sacred idea to it. If it occupied a high\r\nposition among the speakers of Sanscrit, it also means something\r\namongst the Ashantees of Africa, where, however, it\r\nassumes the form of 3333, this being their sacred number. It\r\nis, therefore, the number of the king's wives, or concubines.\r\n\r\nChrysostom says that the three gifts of the three Magi--gold,\r\nmyrrh, and frankincense--were mystic gifts, signifying that\r\nChrist was king, man, and God.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Vision of Piers the Plowman,\" there is an allusion\r\nto the three props betokening the Trinity, evidently derived\r\nfrom the old legend of the[**P3 unclear] Holy Rood, which tells us how the\r\ntree of which Christ's cross was made grew up from three\r\nstems, one of cedar, one of cypress, and one of pine.\r\n\r\nThe three wicked winds, according to old writers (alluded to\r\nin the \"Vision of Piers the Plowman\") are the World, the\r\nFlesh, and the Devil.\r\n\r\nIn the V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 (meaning a sibyl, or prophetess), mention is\r\nmade of the three knowing maidens, who engraved or recorded\r\nevents. Three roots stand on three ways (extend to three\r\nregions), under the ash Yggdrasill; Hela dwells under one;\r\nanother (dwell) the Frost Giants; (under) the third dwell mortal\r\nmen. The ash is the mundane tree represented as embracing\r\nwith its three roots the whole universe.\r\n\r\nTacitus says that the Germans, in their verses, celebrated a\r\ngod born of the earth, Tuisco. This Tuisco had a son named\r\nMaunus, whose three sons were the original ancestors of the\r\nthree principal nations of Germany, viz., the Ing\u00e6vones, Isc\u00e6vones,\r\nand Hermiones. A tradition received by the Romans,",
  "p2620.png": "imported that the Cyclop, Polyphemus, had by Galatea three\r\nsons, named Celtus, Illyrius, and Gallus. Hesiod mentions\r\nthree sons from the marriage of Heaven and Earth--Celtus,\r\nBriareus, and Gyges.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of the idolatrous Arabs to keep seven\r\ndivination arrows in the temple of Mecca, but generally they\r\nmade use of three only, on one of which was written, \"My Lord\r\nhath commanded me,\" on another, \"My Lord hath forbidden\r\nme,\" and the third was blank.\r\n\r\nIn Buddhism the three causes of demerits are--lust, anger,\r\nand ignorance; the first has for its destroying agent fire; anger\r\nhas water; and ignorance, wind. The three precious things\r\nare Buddha, the law, and the assembly. The sacred books\r\nconsist of three great divisions. Three great obeisances are\r\nmade in honour of the three precious things.\r\n\r\nThe images of Buddha are only represented in three positions,\r\nviz., sitting cross-legged, standing, as if preparing to\r\nadvance, and reclining on his side with his head resting on a\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nThe tri-rattan of the Hindoos is the triple-gemmed \"Alpha\r\nand Omega\" symbol of the Buddhists.\r\n\r\nThe Trik\u00e2ya, in China, means three bodies--the spiritual\r\nbody, which is permanent and indestructible; the form which\r\nbelongs to every Buddhist, as a reward for his merits; and the\r\nbody which has the power of assuming any shape, in order\r\nto propagate the doctrines of Buddha. The Hindoos worship,\r\nbesides their celestial gods and representatives, three classes of\r\ndivinities--the village god; the household god; and the personal,\r\nor patron god. So in ancient Peru were three divinities\r\nof similar character.\r\n\r\nNiall Trassach) one of the ancient kings of Ireland, was so\r\nsurnamed because it is said the night he was born three showers\r\nfell--one of honey, one of silver, one of blood.\r\n\r\nThe three changes of rings in the Russian marriage ceremony\r\nmay probably have some reference to a peculiarity of legends\r\nin that country, where the ever-predominating number three",
  "p2630.png": "occurs. Thus, fathers are usually said to have three sons; the\r\nheroes and knights-errant of olden fiction ride through three\r\ntimes nine countries; the bravest are always thirty-three years\r\nold; they achieve their deeds only on the third attempt. Are\r\nthese emblematic of the Trinity?\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans used an oath on important occasions, and\r\nheld it to be most sacred; swearing by the number four, which\r\nthey wrote by ten dots in the form of a triangle, so that each\r\nside consisted of four dots, thus [**symbol][** .] Some have imagined\r\nthat Pythagoras took the hint of this from the Nomen Tetragrammaton\r\nof the Jews; and that having acquired some notion of\r\nthe Trinity, he intended to express it by the triangle, which is\r\ncalled his Trigonon Mysticum.\r\n\r\nGalen connected the four \"humours,\" or \"complexions\" of\r\nmen with the \"Four Humours.\" Those of a sanguine temperament\r\nhave an excess of blood due to air; those of a phlegmatic\r\ntemperament, an excess of phlegm, or water; those of a\r\nmelancholy temperament, an excess of the dull earth; and,\r\nlastly, those of a choleric temperament, an excess of fire.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Vision of Piers the Plowman,\" the five sons of Conscience\r\nare said to be See-well, Say-Well, Hear-well, Work-well,\r\nand Good-faith Go-well. This is a deviation from the original\r\nidea, which made the Five Guardians to be the Five Wits, or\r\nFive Senses, illustrated in Bunyan's allegory of the Holy War.\r\nIn the \"Ancren Riwle,\" the heart's wardens are the five wits--sight\r\nand hearing, tasting and smelling, and the feeling of every\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nIn the Cabala, the number six was considered to be one of\r\npotent mystical properties. The rabbinical writers assert that\r\nthe manna, when it was found, was marked with the Hebrew\r\nvau, the equivalent of number six; and as the world was\r\ncreated in six days; as a servant had to serve six years (Exodus\r\nxxi. 2); as the soil was tilled for six years (Exodus xxiii. 10);\r\nas Job endured six tribulations--so this number was typical of\r\nlabour and suffering. Consequently it was impressed on the",
  "p2640.png": "manna, not only to show the Israelites that it fell but on six\r\ndays, but also to warn them of the miseries they would undergo,\r\nif they dared to desecrate the Sabbath day.\r\n\r\nThe number six has been considered at Rome as ominous\r\nof misfortune. Tarquinius Sextus was the very worst of the\r\nTarquins, and his brutal conduct led to a revolution in the\r\ngovernment; under Urban the Sixth, the great schism of the west\r\nbroke out; Alexander the Sixth outdid all that his predecessors\r\namongst the Tarquins or the Popes had ventured to do\r\nbefore him; and the presentiment seemed to receive confirmation\r\nin the misfortunes of the reign of Pius the Sixth, to whose\r\nelection was applied this line:\r\n\r\n\"Semper sub sextis perdita Roma fuit.\"\r\n\r\nNapier, in his \"Florence,\" says: \"Superstition observed\r\nthat Alexander (first Duke of Florence) died in the year 1536\r\n(Florentine style), on the sixth day of the month, on the sixth\r\nhour of the night, of six wounds, at twenty-six years of age, in\r\nthe sixth year of his reign, and therefore six sixes were combined\r\nin his death, making up the age of 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 of the\r\ncurrent year of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange (heir-apparent of the King of Holland),\r\nwho died somewhat suddenly at Paris (June 11, 1879), was, it\r\nis said, very superstitious with regard to the numbers six and\r\neleven. As a sporting man, he always withdrew his horses\r\nwhen they were classed under one or the other. By a curious\r\ncoincidence, the prince died on the eleventh day of the sixth\r\nmonth of the year, and at eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nIn \"Notes and Queries\" (June 5, 1852), we find the following\r\nnote by the editor: \"The number seven has been a subject\r\nof particular speculation with some old writers; and every\r\ndepartment of nature, science, literature, and art, has been\r\nransacked for the purpose of discovering septenary combination.\"\r\nIn the year 1502, there was printed at Leipsic a work\r\nentitled \"Heptalogium Virgilii Salzburgensis,\" in honour of the\r\nnumber seven. It consists of seven parts, each consisting of",
  "p2650.png": "seven divisions. But the most curious work on the subject of\r\nnumbers is the following, the contents of which, as might be\r\nexpected, are quite worthy of the title, \"The Secrets of\r\nNumbers, according to Theological, Arithmetical, Geometrical,\r\nand Harmonical Computation; drawn, for the better part, out\r\nof those Ancients as well as Neoteriques. Pleasing to read,\r\nprofitable to understande, opening themselves to the capacities\r\nof both learned and unlearned; being no other than a key to\r\nlead men to any doctrinal knowledge whatsoever.\" By\r\nWilliam Ingpen, Gent., London, 1624.[*] In chap. ix., the\r\nauthor has given many notable opinions from learned men to\r\nprove the excellency of the number seven: \"First, it neither\r\nbegets, nor is begotten, according to the saying of Philo.\r\nSome numbers, indeed, within the compass of ten, beget, but\r\nare not begotten; and that is the unarie. Others are begotten,\r\nbut beget not, as the octonarie. Only the septenarie, having\r\na prerogative above them all, neither begetteth nor is begotten.\r\nThis is its first divinity, or perfection. Secondly, this\r\nis an harmonical number, and the well and fountain of that\r\nfair and lovely Digramma, because it includeth within itself all\r\nmanner of harmony. Thirdly, it is a theological number, consisting\r\nof perfection. Fourthly, because of its compositure;\r\nfor it is there compounded of one and six; two and five; three\r\nand four. Now, every one of these being excellent in themselves\r\n(as hath been demonstrated), how can this number be\r\nbut far more excellent, consisting of them all, and participating,\r\nas it were, in all their excellent virtues.\"\r\n\r\nIn a manuscript on Witchcraft, by John Bell, a Scottish\r\nminister (1705), he says: \"Are there not some who cure by\r\nobserving number? after the example of Balaam, who used\r\nmagiam geometricam (Numbers xxiii. 1), 'build me here seven\r\naltars, and prepare me here seven oxen, and seven rams,' etc.\r\n\r\n* The Rev. Richard Clarke wrote a learned treatise on the number seven.\r\nFra Paolo, in his \"History of the Council of Trent,\" indicates all the\r\nsupposed advantages of the number. Much information on the mystical\r\nimport of the numbers will be found in Cudworth's \"Intellectual System,\"\r\nand in Taylor's \"Theoretic Arithmetic.\"",
  "p2660.png": "There are some witches who enjoin the sick to dip their shirt seven\r\ntimes in south-running water. Elisha sends Naaman to wash\r\nin Jordan seven times. Elijah, on the top of Carmel, sends his\r\nservant seven times to look for rain. When Jericho was taken\r\nthey compassed the city seven times.\"\r\n\r\nNot only the ancient Jews but the heathens regarded this\r\nnumber of great efficacy in religious actions. Apuleius says:\r\n\"Desirous of purifying myself, I wash in the sea, and dip my\r\nhead in the waves seven times, Pythagoras having thought that\r\nthis number is above all others most proper in the concerns of\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Macrobius, the Egyptians discovered that the\r\nsun was the centre of the orbits of Mercury and Venus. But,\r\nas he adds, that these same Egyptians taught that the sphere\r\nof the sun was the second, and that it ought to be placed\r\nimmediately above that of the moon, whilst the Chaldeans\r\nmaintained that it was the fourth, and occupied the middle of\r\nthe planetary system, it appears more probable that the latter\r\nwere the true authors of this discovery. If it be also considered\r\nthat, according to the same author, the Greeks were in\r\npossession from the earliest times of a symbol of Apollo with a\r\nlyre with seven strings, which represented the orbits of the seven\r\nplanets, and if we compare this symbol with the sacrifice of the\r\nseven bats to the sun, by the Sab\u00e6ans, and the funeral dance\r\nperformed by the seven planets round the sun in the temple of\r\nBabylon, on the night of the death of Tammuz, we shall have\r\nlittle difficulty in forming our notions.\r\n\r\nSeven, as an astronomical period, is known to most nations,\r\nand has been from times prior to history. Clemens Alexandrinus\r\nsays the moon's phases are changed every seven\r\ndays. Seleucus, the mathematician, he also says distinguishes\r\nseven phases of that luminary.[*] He notices the seven planets,\r\n\r\n* The ancients were acquainted with only seven metals: gold, silver,\r\ncopper, tin, iron, lead, and mercury. These seven metals were originally\r\nsupposed to be in some way connected with the seven heavenly bodies then\r\nknown to belong to our system. To bright yellow gold, the name of Sol",

Fire\r\nanimates, earth gives the sense of feeling, water gives speech,\r\nair gives taste, mist gives sight, flowers give hearing, the south\r\nwind gives smelling. Hence the seven senses are animation,\r\nfeeling, speech, taste, sight, hearing, and smelling.\r\n\r\nNumerous and difficult were the combination of numbers\r\nwhich puzzled the brains of astrologers in former times. The\r\ntwelve signs of the Zodiac were divided into those called northern\r\nand commanding (the first six), and those called southern and\r\nobeying (the remaining six). The four triplicities was another\r\ndistribution of the twelve signs, into groups of four, denoted\r\nas fiery, earthy, airy, and watery. The properties of the seven\r\nplanets exercised a preponderating influence in the occult\r\nscience. The aspects of the planets were divided into five.\r\nEach of the planets, except the sun and moon, had two signs,\r\nor houses, called their own--the one diurnal, the other nocturnal.\r\nThe Twelve Planetary Houses comprehended all that\r\ncould possibly befall any individual.\r\n\r\nThe seven planets were considered by the Persians the seven\r\ngates of heaven; the last of which, the sun, was termed the\r\ngolden gate. Chaucer says:\r\n\r\n\"The bodies sevene eke, to them here anon;\r\nSol Gold is, and Luna Silver we threpe;\r\nMars Iren, Mercurie Quikesilver we clepe;\r\nSaturnus Lede, and Jupiter is Tin;\r\nAnd Venus Coper, by my father's kin.\"\r\n\r\nwas given; whilst white silver was termed Luna; copper, which had\r\nchiefly been obtained from the island of Cyprus, and received its common\r\nname (cuprum) from this source, was likewise called Venus. Tin was\r\nspecially dedicated to Jupiter; iron to Mars, the god of war; whilst heavy,\r\nthick, dull lead was connected with Saturn; and the mobile quicksilver\r\nwas called Mercury, after the active messenger of the gods.",
  "p2680.png": "\r\nA passage containing the words \"seven senses,\" occurs in the\r\npoem of Taliesin, called Y Byd Mawr, or the Macrocosm, of\r\nwhich a translation may be found in vol. xxi. of the British\r\nMagazine. The writer of the paper in which it is quoted refers\r\nalso to the Mysterium Magnum of Jacob B\u0153hmen, which\r\nteaches \"how the soul of man in his\" inward holy body, was\r\ncompounded of \"the seven properties under the influence of\r\nthe seven planets:\"\r\n\r\n\"I will adore my Father,\r\nMy God, my Supporter,\r\nWho placed, throughout my head,\r\nThe soul of my reason,\r\nAnd made for my perception\r\nMy seven faculties\r\nOf fire, and earth, and water, and air,\r\nAnd mist, and flowers,\r\nAnd the southerly wind,\r\nAs it were seven senses of reason\r\nFor my Father to impel me;\r\nWith the first I shall be animated,\r\nWith the second I shall touch,\r\nWith the third I shall cry out,\r\nWith the fourth I shall taste,\r\nWith the fifth I shall see,\r\nWith the sixth I shall hear,\r\nWith the seventh I shall smell;\r\nAnd I will maintain\r\nThat seven skies there are\r\nOver the astrologer's head,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe seven heavens of the Koran are, literally, seven paths, by\r\nwhich the heavens are meant, because, according to some expositors,\r\nthey are the paths of the angels and of the celestial\r\nbodies; though the original word also signifies things which are\r\nfolded, or placed like stories one above another, as the Mohammedans\r\nsuppose the heavens to be.\r\n\r\nAmong the Russians there is a superstition that a ladder\r\nshould be placed in the grave of a dead person by which the\r\nsoul may climb to heaven up the steep sides of the hill leading\r\nto it. This ladder has seven bars or rungs, in reference to the\r\n\"seven\" heavens.\r\n\r\nIn a poem entitled \"This World is but a Vanyte,\" from the",
  "p2690.png": "Lambeth MS., 853, about 1430 A.D., is a curious comparison of\r\nthe life of man to the seven times of the day. The number\r\nseven is here determined apparently by the hours of the Romish\r\nChurch. Thus corresponding to matins, prime, tierce, sext,\r\nnones, vespers, and compline, we have the following periods of\r\nthe day and of man's life: \"1. Morning. The infant is like the\r\nmorning, at first born spotless and innocent 2. Midmorrow.\r\nThis is the period of childhood. 3. Undern (9 a.m.). The\r\nboy is put to school 4. Midday. He is knighted and fights\r\nbattles. 5. High-noon (i.e., nones, or 9th hour--3 p.m.). He\r\nis crowned a king, and fulfils all his pleasure. 6. Midovernoon\r\n(i.e., the middle of the period between high-noon and evensong).\r\nThe man begins to droop, and cares little for the pleasures of\r\nyouth. 7. Evensong. The man walks with a staff, and death\r\nseeks him.\r\n\r\nThe seven penitential psalms, by constant repetition, had a\r\nsomniferous influence. \"But Gargantua,\" says Rabelais, \"could\r\nnot sleep by any means, on which side soever he turned himself.\r\nWhereupon the monk said to him, 'I never sleep\r\nsoundly but when I am at sermon or prayers. Let us, therefore,\r\nbegin, you and I, the seven penitential psalms, to try whether\r\nyou shall not quickly fall asleep.' The conceit pleased Gargantua\r\nvery well; and beginning the first of these psalms, as\r\nsoon as they came to Beati quorum, they fell asleep, both one\r\nand the other.\"\r\n\r\nIn Howell's \"Epistol\u00e6 Ho-Elian\u00e6,\" 1688, is the following\r\ncurious passage: \"I thank God I have this fruit of my foreign\r\ntravels, that I can pray to him every day in the week in several\r\nlanguages, and upon Sunday, in seven, which, n[** in?] oraisons[** orisons?] of my\r\nown, I punctually perform in my private post-meridian devotions.\r\nEt sic \u00e6ternam contendo attingere vitam. By these steps\r\nI strive to climb to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Harleian MSS. is a curious old English treatise\r\non the seven deadly sins, which are \"lykyned to sevene sundry\r\nbestis: as pryde to y^e lyon.

They are mentioned in the \"Vision of Piers\r\nthe Plowman\"--Humilitas, humility; Caritas, charity, love;\r\nPatientia, patience; Castitas, chastity; Eleemosyna, bounty;\r\nAbstinentio, abstinence; Vigilantia, business. By some of the\r\nearly theologians, the seven virtues are termed the seven sisters;\r\npeace taking the place of business.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Apology for Lollard Doctrines,\" attributed to Wycliffe,\r\nand the MS. of which is in the library of Trinity College,\r\nDublin, there is \"Septem peccata capitalia\"; a treatise on the\r\nseven deadly sins, beginning: \"Sith bileue techeth vs that every\r\nyuel is other synne, or cometh of synne, synne shulde be fled\r\nas almaner of yuel.\"\r\n\r\nIn Constable's Sonnets (Decad. 1, S. 6), we have:\r\n\r\n\"Mine eye with all the deadly sins is fraught,\r\nFirst proud, sith it presum'd to look so hie,\r\nA watchman being made, stoode gazing by,\r\nAnd idle, took no heede till I was caught;\r\nAnd envious, beares envie that by (my) thought\r\nShould in his absence be to her so nie;\r\nTo kill my hart, mine eye let in her eye,\r\nAnd so consent gave to a murther wrought;\r\nAnd covetous, it never would remove\r\nFrom her faire haire, gold doth so please his sight;\r\nUnchast, a bande betweene my heart and love;\r\nA glutton eye, with teares drunke every night.\r\nThese sinnes procured have a goddesse ire,\r\nWherefore my hart is damn'd in love's sweet fire.\"\r\n\r\nA curious French manuscript belonging to the latter part of\r\nthe thirteenth century, has a singular illustration of the number\r\nseven.

One\r\nceremony with the stone worn in the girdle, is rather striking.\r\nThe sheikh puts it in and out seven times, saying: \"I tie up\r\ngreediness, and unbind generosity. I tie up anger, and unbind\r\nweakness. I tie up ignorance, and unbind the fear of God. I\r\ntie up passion, and unbind the love of God. I tie up the\r\ndevilish, and unbind the divine.\"\r\n\r\nIn Lane's \"Modern Egyptians,\" mention is made of a ridiculous\r\nceremony for the cure of a pimple on the edge of the\r\neyelid. The person affected with it goes to any seven women\r\nof the name of Fa't'meh, in seven different houses, and begs\r\nfrom each of them a morsel of bread; these seven morsels constitute\r\nthe remedy.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable to notice the almost universal reverence in\r\nancient times for the numbers three, seven, and forty. Jacob\r\nserved seven years for each of his wives, and the Arabs of remote\r\nperiods frequently did the same. Hence the Moors transmitted\r\nthe custom to the Spaniards, as we perceive in the Spanish\r\nballads. Thus, in that of Calainos:\r\n\r\n\"Por vos le servi siete anos,\r\nSin inter\u00e8s in soldada;\r\nNi el tampoco me la di\u00f4,\r\nNi yo la demandaria.\"",
  "p2720.png": "\r\nIn another, Count Carlos paid his addresses for seven years to\r\nthe Princess Clara; and in that of Prince Baldwin, the bride was\r\nbrought seven times, in different dresses, to the bridal chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, and after them the Spaniards, applied the number\r\nseven to sortil\u00e8ge, precisely in the same manner as the pagan\r\nArabs are stated to have done. Accordingly, when Bertram's\r\nfather sought his son after the battle of Roncesvalles, his\r\nfriends cast lots seven times:\r\n\r\n\"Siete veces echan suerte\r\nQuien le volver\u00e1[** ?] buscar.\"\r\n\r\nThe Moors did the same when they tried to seize the Spanish\r\nadmiral, Guarinos. Hence, when Count Irlos was forced by the\r\nking to leave his young wife, and fight with the Moor Aliarde\r\nand his troops, he says:\r\n\r\n\"Siete anos, la Condesa,\r\nSiete anos me esperad\r\nSi \u00e0 los ocho no vinier\u00e8,\r\nA los nueve vos casad.\"\r\n\r\nThe superstition respecting climacterics, or critical periods of\r\nlife, was very strong during the middle ages; and even\r\ndown to rather recent times, the mystic numbers 7 and 9 so\r\nfrequently occurring in the Bible, and the combination of these\r\nnumbers, had their influence with many persons. It was\r\nbelieved that the constitution of man changed every seven\r\nyears, and that during every septime the whole of the solids and\r\nfluids of the body were periodically renewed--the old cast off,\r\nand new matter formed. Periods of seven years were looked\r\nupon as steps or stages in life. At seven years of age a child\r\nhad left infancy; at twice seven, or fourteen, he had attained\r\npuberty; at three times seven, or twenty-one, he had reached\r\nmanhood, and so on. But as people advanced in years the\r\nmore critical points were approached, and the grand climacteric\r\nwas looked forward to with some anxiety. Combinations of the\r\nnumbers 3, 7, and 9, were mostly employed, and 3 +[** should this + sign and next three be x ?] 7 = 21;\r\n7 + 7 = 49; 7 + 9 = 63, and 9 + 9 = 81, were important periods.",

For olde men seldom passe that\r\nyear, but they are in danger of their lives. Now there are two\r\nyears, the seventh and ninth, that commonly bring great changes\r\nin a man's life, and great dangers, wherefore sixty-three, that\r\ncontaines both these numbers multiplied together, comes not\r\nwithout heaps of dangers, for nine times seven, or seven times\r\nnine are sixty-three.

The Bishop of London, Doctor Vaughan,\r\ncaused divers to be brought to the child as aforesaid, who said\r\na short prayer as (he) imposed his hands upon, as 'tis said he\r\ndid unto others; but no miracle followeth any, so that it appeareth\r\nto be a plain lie invented to win grace to the popish\r\nfaction.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"British Apollo\" (edit 1726) we find the following\r\nanswer given by the oracle to the complaint of a seventh son,\r\netc., that he could not heal as much as the toothache. \"Be\r\nnot discouraged that you can cure no disease, for you are much\r\nmore happy than those seventh sons who believe they can.\r\nSince they, in reality, are so far from being able to cure others,\r\nthat they are not able to release themselves from the complication\r\nof distempers, both of body and mind, they labour under,\r\nas the Hippo vapours, vanity, affectation, etc., which are the ingredients\r\nthat compound their faith.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chambers's \"Domestic Annals of Scotland\" (ii. 396), it\r\nis stated that in February, 1682, one Hugh McGie \"gave in a",

The woman who receives him in her arms,\r\nplaces in his tiny hand whatever substance she decides that he shall rub with\r\nin after-life, and she is very careful not to let him touch anything until this\r\nshall have been accomplished. If silver is to be the charm, she has provided\r\na sixpenny or threepenny bit; but as the coinage of the realm may\r\npossibly change during his lifetime, and thus render his cure valueless, she\r\nhas more likely placed meal, or salt, upon the table, within reach. Sometimes\r\nit is determined that he is to rub with his own hair, and in this case\r\nthe father is summoned and requested to kneel down before his new-born\r\nson, whose little fingers are guided to his head, and helped to close upon a\r\nlock of hair.

There are several articles on this subject\r\nin the Gentleman's Magazine, one of which (in 1798)\r\ndisposes of the question thus: \"The superstition that where a\r\ncompany of persons amount to thirteen, one of them will die\r\nwithin the twelvemonth afterwards, seems to be founded on\r\nthe calculations adhered to by the insurance offices, which pre-*",

He\r\nadvised the king to take away one or two fellowships, so as to\r\ndiscompose that superstitious number. 'Oh no,' said the\r\nking, 'I have a better way than that to mar their conceit; I\r\nwill add a thirteenth fellowship to them,' which he did accordingly,\r\nand so it remaineth to the present day.\"\r\n\r\nWaldron, in his \"Description of the Isle of Man\" (1731),\r\nspeaking of a crypt, or subterranean chapel near Peel Castle,\r\nsays: \"Within are thirteen pillars, on which the whole chapel\r\nis supported. They have a superstition that whatsoever stranger\r\ngoes to see this cavern out of curiosity, and omits to count the\r\npillars, shall do something to occasion his being confined there.\"\r\nThe Germans derive this superstition from the Northern\r\nMythology. In \"Die Urreligion des Deutschen Volkes in\r\nHessischen Sitten,\" etc., von E. M\u00fclhausse, Cassell, 1860, we\r\nread: \"Wahrscheinlich hat dieser Glaube in dem Mythus\r\nseinen Grund, dass von den 13 G\u00f6ttern, die urspr\u00fcnglich unschliesslich\r\ndes Loki in Walhall tagten, einer sterben musste,\r\nn\u00e4mlich Baldur.\" The Italians regard thirteen as unlucky,\r\nbecause the thirteenth card of one of the sets of cards used in\r\n\r\n* There seems to be no doubt that the notion of thirteen to dinner has\r\nreference to the Last Supper, at which thirteen were present. \"Some,\"\r\nobserves Lord Lyttelton, in \"Notes and Queries,\" \"I believe, have carried\r\nit to the extent of disliking that number at all times; but the commoner\r\nform limits it to Friday.

For dropsy,\r\nthrice three earth-worms with their heads cut off, immersed in\r\nholy water, in which sugar or liquorice is to be dissolved, is\r\nrecommended to be taken daily for nine days. So also are\r\nsome powerful diuretics directed to be given for nine days in\r\nthe same disease. And, again, another drink made of alexander,\r\nbetony, and fennel, for seven days for the like purpose.\r\nCentaury is ordered to be taken for fifteen days to expel venom\r\nof whatever description, and a drink of the seed of cress is\r\nrecommended for its healing properties, if persisted in for three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThere was a singular custom at Rome, which proves, however,\r\nthat the seller of provisions had a voice in declaring the\r\nvalue of his wares. Purchaser and vendor simultaneously\r\nclosed, and then suddenly opened, one of their hands, or some\r\nof their fingers. If the number of fingers on both sides was\r\neven, the vendor obtained the price which he had previously\r\nasked; but if the number was uneven, the buyer received the\r\ngoods for the sum he had just before tendered.",
  "p2800.png": "\r\nThe Romans regarded an even number as unlucky, because,\r\nsince it could be divided equally, it was the emblem of death\r\nand dissolution. It is interesting to observe the care with\r\nwhich they avoided these even numbers. The year of Numa\r\nwas made to consist of 355 days, though the moon in twelve\r\nlunations appears to complete but 354 days, and as it is impossible\r\nto divide any odd number into twelve parts, without\r\none, at least, of the parts being an even number, they contrived\r\nto divide the solitary even month (February) into a period of\r\ntwenty-three days, and five supernumerary ones. Christians who\r\nwere inclined to be superstitious about numbers, strengthened\r\nthemselves in their ideas by observing that God was one in\r\nthree, that God rested on the seventh day, and bade it be kept\r\nholy for ever.\r\n\r\nThe strange prejudice in favour of odd numbers, which dates\r\nfrom the highest antiquity, and is spread through the western\r\nworld, exists in all its force amongst the Siamese. They will\r\nbuild no staircase having an even number of stairs; no house\r\nmust have an even number of rooms, doors, or windows, yet\r\nthe decimal system is the universal medium by which all the\r\nassociations connected with eternity and infinity are impressed\r\non the Siamese mind; and the gradations from tens to hundreds,\r\nthousands, millions, billions, are favourite elements of\r\nreligious calculation among the bonzes.\r\n\r\nIn setting a hen, says Grose, the good woman holds it an\r\nindispensable rule to put an odd number of eggs.\r\n\r\nIt is told (with some share of doubt, however) of Dr. Johnson,\r\nthat when a child of three years old, he chanced to tread upon\r\na duckling, the eleventh of a brood, and killed it; upon which\r\nhe dictated to his mother the following epitaph:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies good Master Duck,\r\nWhom Samuel Johnson trod on,\r\nIf it had lived, it had been good luck\r\nFor then we'd had an odd one.\"\r\n\r\nMANY works have been written, and various opinions\r\nformed, respecting the passage in the Revelation\r\n(xiii. 18), \"Here is wisdom; let him that hath understanding",
  "p2810.png": "count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and\r\nhis number is six hundred three score and six.\" Some have\r\nimagined that this mystical number relates to a king; some to\r\na kingdom, and others to the Pope. It should be noticed,\r\nhowever, that the Revelation treats of the different states of the\r\nChristian churches, as appears from the second and third chapters,\r\nwhere the churches are particularly spoken of. The\r\npassage seems to refer to the conquest and depopulation of\r\nJerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. It would seem that this number,\r\n666, comprehends the interval of time from the destruction\r\nof the first Temple, and the capture by Nebuchadnezzar, the\r\noverthrow of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the nation, which\r\nwas 666 years. If we subtract the year of the Julian period\r\n(4115) at the destruction of the first Temple, when the divine\r\ncommunication ceased, from the year of the Julian period at\r\nthe birth of Christ (4711), the remainder is 596, the interval of\r\ntime between these two remarkable epochs; then, if to this\r\nremainder, 596, we add 70 years of the Christian era, when\r\nJerusalem and the Temple were destroyed by the Romans, at\r\nthe establishment of the Christian religion, we find the mystical\r\nnumber 666, referring to the time when the Divine theocracy\r\nceased in the true visible church of God, among the Jews, to\r\nthe establishment of the true visible church of God, by our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, among the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nIt is usual, in the attempts to unravel the mysterious meaning\r\nof the number of the beast, in the Book of Revelation, to\r\nsuppose that every letter in the name of the beast was to be\r\ntaken as a numeral, and that these numerals were to be added\r\ntogether, in order to make the amount to 666, the number\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nUpon no passage of Scripture, probably, has more ingenuity\r\nbeen displayed than in the attempt to interpret the number of\r\nthe beast: \"And his number is six hundred three score and\r\nsix.\" It has been found in the names of various Popes, and\r\nNapoleon I. was clearly indicated to the satisfaction of many.\r\nA modern writer finds Mammon to be the beast, and has",
  "p2820.png": "established his opinion by a quotation from 1 Kings x. 14:\r\n\"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year\r\nwas six hundred three score and six talents of gold.\"\r\n\r\nIn an historical tract (1646) entitled \"Querela Cantabregiensis,\"\r\nspeaking of the Parliamentary Covenant, the author\r\nthus expresses himself: \"This Covenant, for which all this\r\npersecution has been, consisted of six articles, and these articles\r\nof 666 words.... But as for the number of the beast, to answer\r\ndirectly to the words of these six articles, it is a thing (which\r\nconsidering God's blessed providence in any particular thing)\r\nhath made many of us and others seriously and often to reflect\r\nupon it, though we were never so superstitiously caballisticall[** cabalistical?] as\r\nto ascribe much to numbers. This discovery, we confess, was\r\nnot made by any of us, but by a very judicious and worthy\r\ndivine, formerly of our University (M. Geast), and then a prisoner\r\nfor his conscience, within the precincts of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is singular to notice in how many instances the interpretation\r\nof this mystic number was adapted to the circumstances,\r\nand particular events, of various times; and hew ingeniously\r\nthe figures were tortured into a prophetic meaning. I must\r\nrefer the reader who is interested on this subject, to the shelves\r\nof the British Museum, where he will find much to gratify his\r\ncuriosity. Space will only permit me to notice a few works in\r\nwhich the matter is treated upon.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the number of 1666, Dr. Worthington says in a\r\nletter to Whitefoot (February 13, 1665-6): \"I suppose you\r\nhave seen or heard of some small pieces of one T. L. as the\r\nVoice out of the Wilderness and An Exposition of Revelation\r\nC. 12 and 13, with other tracts about the downfall of Rome in\r\n1666 (though I think he will prove to be mistaken therein).\r\nHe lived in Elizabeth's reign, and afterwards betook himself to\r\na shepherd's life.\"\r\n\r\nAddison, in the \"Spectator\" (No. 191), adverting to the selection\r\nof lottery tickets, observes: \"I have been told of a certain\r\nzealous dissenter, who, being a great enemy to Popery, and\r\nbelieving that bad men are the most fortunate in this world, will",
  "p2830.png": "lay two to one on the number 666 against any other number,\r\nbecause, says he, it is the number of the Beast.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many absurdities connected with the mystical\r\nnumbers of 7 and 666, is that contained in a collection of\r\nbroadsides in the library of the Society of Antiquaries, relating\r\nto the first Napoleon. It is addressed to Mr. Urban: \"The\r\nfollowing singular coincidences may furnish matter for reflection\r\nto the curious. It has been generally admitted that the French\r\nEmpire, after passing under seven different forms of government\r\n(or seven heads), was divided into ten kingdoms in Europe (the\r\nten horns of DANIEL and JOHN), and that, notwithstanding the\r\nvarious changes Europe has undergone, the number of kingdoms\r\nwas generally about ten. It is not a little surprising that\r\nthe Heads of the family of Napoleon, who have effected such a\r\nchange in the same empire are exactly seven, viz., Napoleon;\r\nJoseph, King of Italy; Louis, King of Holland; Jerome;\r\nMurat, Duke of Berg and Cleves; Cardinal Fesch; Beauharnois,\r\nthe adopted son of Napoleon. And, also, that the\r\nmembers of the New Federation are just ten, viz., Bavaria, W\u00fcrtemberg,\r\nBaden, Darmstadt, Nassau, Ysembourg, Hohenzollern,\r\nAremberg, Salm, Leyen.\r\n\r\n\"It is also remarkable that in the man's name, Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte, there are precisely three times six letters; Napole\r\n(6), on Buon (6), Aparte (6)--666. And in his name is contained\r\nthe name given by JOHN to the King of the Locusts,\r\nwho is called Apoleon, or the Destroyer.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Notes and Queries\" (3 Series, vol. viii. p. 377)\r\nmentions having a pamphlet called \"Proofs of Holy Writ, or\r\nEngland's Triumph over Buonaparte and his Armada; foretold\r\nin express Terms Seventeen hundred Years ago,\" dated London,\r\nJanuary 1, 1804. In this it is shown, first (Latinus, or\r\nman of Latium) Italian, i.e., Buonaparte: the separate letters\r\nbeing taken as Greek numerals, is equal to 666. And, secondly,\r\nthat the name of the First Consul being spelt Bonneparte, is\r\nalso equal to 666, according to the same method of interpretation.",
  "p2840.png": "\r\nAffixed to this pamphlet are the following extracts cut out of\r\nsome other work on the subject: \"The Church of Rome is\r\ngenerally honoured as the beast; thus, number 666, the number\r\nof the beast,\" says the Beehive of the Romish Church,\r\n1580, \"doe agree very well in one with this Greeke worde,\r\n\u0395\u039a\u039a\u039b\u0397\u03a3\u0399\u0391 \u0399\u03a4\u0391\u039b\u0399\u039a\u0391 (Ecclesia Italica), which is to say the\r\nItalian or Romish Church: for each letter in the Greek makes\r\none number--this maketh together 666. Apoc. xiii. 17.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Faber also prophesied the downfall of Buonaparte,\r\nthe beast, from the thirteenth chapter of Revelations.\r\nThese are the words: \"The beast rising out of the sea (Corsica),\r\nwith 7 heads and 10 horns, and upon his head 10 horns and 10\r\ncrowns, is Buonaparte. This beast was to have reigned 42\r\nmonths as Emperor of France. Buonaparte has nearly reigned\r\nthis exact number of months: the dragon, i.e. the devil, gave\r\nhim the power and great authority, and he caused all, both\r\ngreat and small, both rich and poor, free and bond, to receive\r\na mark in their right hand, i.e. Buonaparte has caused all persons\r\nto submit to his tyranny. The beast's number was six\r\nhundred three score and six, which exactly corresponds with\r\nthe numerical calculations of all the letters in Buonaparte's name,\r\nreckoning the letters according to the number affixed to each\r\nbefore the introduction of the figures; thus, N 40, A 1, P 60,\r\nO 50, L 20, E 5, A 1, N 40, the letters in his Christian name:\r\nB 2, U 110, O 50, N 40, A 1, P 60, A 1, R 80, T 100, E 5,\r\nbeing the letters of his surname, amounting altogether to\r\n666--the identical number of the beast, i.e. Buonaparte.\"\r\nThis divine adds, \"that without the smallest doubt, as the\r\ntruth of Revelation can never be questioned, so it follows that\r\nthe Spanish patriots are destined to put an end to this beast\r\nBuonaparte.\" Well may Swift observe that such commentators\r\non the Revelations turn out prophets without understanding one\r\nword of the text.\r\n\r\nRobert J.

(Bagster); and \"Lateinos ... being none other than\r\nthe Pope of Rome,\" Reginald Rabett, 8vo. (1835).\r\n\r\nA writer mentions the title of a work on the number 666, as\r\nfollows: \"An Interpretation of the Number 666, wherein not\r\nonly the manner how this Number ought to be interpreted, is\r\nclearly proved and demonstrated, but it is also shewn that this\r\nNumber is an exquisite and perfect Character, truly, exactly,\r\nand essentially describing that state of Government to which all\r\nother notes of Anti-Christ do agree; with all known objections,\r\nsolidly and fully answered, that can be materially brought against\r\nit. By Francis Potter, D.D. Dan. xii. 4. Oxford, printed\r\n\r\n* Macaulay, in one of his amusing letters from India, writes that at\r\nMysore \"I found an Englishman, who, without any preface, accosted me\r\nthus: 'Pray, Mr. Macaulay, do you not think that Buonaparte was the\r\nBeast?' 'No, sir, I cannot say that I do.' 'Sir, he was the Beast. I can\r\nprove it. I have found the number 666 in his name. Why, sir, if he was\r\nnot the Beast, who was?' This was a puzzling question, and I am not a\r\nlittle vain of my answer. 'Sir,' said I, 'the House of Commons is the\r\nBeast. There are 658 members of the House, and these, with their chief\r\nofficers,--the three clerks, the serjeant and his deputy, the chaplain, the\r\ndoor-keeper, and the librarian,--make 666.' 'Well, sir, that is strange.\r\nBut I can assure you that, if you wrote Napoleon Buonaparte in Arabic,\r\nleaving out only two letters, it will give 666.' 'And, pray, sir, what right\r\nhave you to leave out two letters? And as St. John was writing Greek and\r\nto Greeks, is it not likely he would use the Greek, rather than the Arabic\r\nnotation?' 'But, sir,' said this learned divine, 'everyone knows that the\r\nGreek letters were never used to mark numbers.' I answered with the\r\nmeekest look and voice possible: 'I do not think that everyone knows\r\nthat. Indeed, I have every reason to believe that a different opinion--erroneous,\r\nno doubt--is universally embraced by all the small minority who\r\nhappen to know any Greek.' So ended the controversy. The man looked\r\nat me as if he thought me a very wicked fellow; and, I dare say, has\r\ndiscovered that, if you write my name in Tamul, leaving out T in Thomas,\r\nB in Babington, and M in Macaulay, it will give the number of this unfortunate\r\nBeast.\"",

Holl,\r\nWorcester, for Hatchard and Co, 1808.\" With all the high-sounding\r\ntitle, Dr. Potter failed in his attempts to elucidate the\r\nmystic number.\r\n\r\nA passage from the Rabbinical writer on the world lasting\r\n6000 years, is thus: \"Sex mille annorum mundus. Duo mille\r\ninane. Duo mille lex. Duo mille dies Messi\u00e6, et propter\r\npeccata nostra qu\u00e6 sunt multa pr\u00e6terierunt de cis qu\u00e6 pr\u00e6terierunt.\"\r\nSwan, in his \"Speculum Mundi\" (1635), endeavours\r\nto prove the chronological errors involved in this theory, and\r\nintimates that the Jews could not have put much faith in it, or\r\nthey would not have disputed the advent of the Messiah.\r\n\r\nThe reason assigned for the duration of the world being\r\nlimited to 6000 years, was, that the period of its existence\r\nshould correspond with the time passed in its creation; and as\r\nthe seventh day from the commencement of creation was the\r\nsecular day of rest, so the seventh day, or thousandth year,\r\nfrom the creation would be the eternal heavenly rest--a day\r\nand a thousand years being considered co-equal, according to\r\nthe words of the inspired psalmist, \"For a thousand years are\r\nin Thy sight as yesterday when it is past\" (Ps. xc. 4).\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century there was a prevalent idea that the\r\nend of the world was approaching. Many charters began with\r\nthese words, \"As the world is now drawing to its close.\" As\r\nthis notion seems to have been founded on some confused\r\ntheory of the millennium, it died away when the seasons proceeded\r\nto the eleventh century with their usual regularity. At\r\na much later period, however, it has been renewed, and even\r\nin the year 1816 a story of this kind found its way from\r\nBologna to Paris. According to this prophecy the world was\r\nto be at an end on the 18th July, 1816. Alarm and consternation\r\npervaded all ranks; several persons retired to their\r\nestates in the country; the churches were filled with devotees,\r\nand the event was awaited with patient dread by even persons\r\nashamed of openly avowing it.\r\n\r\nEvelyn mentions a notion that the millennium was to com-*",

Add 1 + 8 + 8 to 1852 and 1869 results.\r\nSimilarly, the Empress Eug\u00e9nie was born in 1826, and married\r\nto the Emperor in 1853. The ciphers added together in each\r\ndate respectively give 1869, when added to 1852. The corresponding\r\ndates and events in the life of Louis Philippe, when\r\ndealt with in the same way, give the corresponding prophetical\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe date of the great revolution is 1789. Add to 1789 the\r\nsum of its ciphers, and 1814 results--the date of the fall of\r\nthe empire, which arose out of the revolution. The date of\r\nthe last revolution is 1848, and if this date be similarly dealt\r\nwith, it gives as the prophetical results 1869.\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Notes and Queries\" (3 Series, vol x.) remarks\r\nthat \"these extraordinary numbers appear to have started\r\nwith the accession to the throne of Louis XVI. in 1774; by\r\nadding these figures into each other you get the date of his\r\ndeath, or 1774 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 1793, in which year, January 21,\r\nthe amiable monarch was beheaded. Again, the fall of Robespierre,\r\n1794, add 1 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 1815, gives that of Napoleon I.,\r\nre-abdicating June 22, 1815; add to this 1 + 8 + 1 + 5 = 1830,\r\nwhich in its turn gives us the three glorious days of July, and\r\nfall of Charles X.

There, one was offered up as a\r\nsacrifice, but the others were spared, although a sentence was pronounced\r\non each of them; afterwards the knife was placed in\r\njudgment, and was condemned as having been employed in\r\nkilling the ox.\r\n\r\n* \"If a creature be generous, kind, constant, compassionate,\" says Lord\r\nShaftesbury, \"yet if he cannot reflect on what he himself does, or sees\r\nothers do, so as to take notice of what is worthy or honest, and make that\r\nnotice or conception of worth and honesty to be an object of his affection,\r\nhe has not the character of being virtuous; for thus, and no otherwise, he\r\nis capable of having a sense of right and wrong; a sentiment or judgment\r\nof what is done through just, equal, and good affection, or the contrary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jews upon this subject agree with the common and natural opinion;\r\nand the Talmud accordingly, when any mischief has been done by an\r\nanimal, distinguishes between an innocent beast and a vicious one, the\r\nowner of an innocent one being required to pay only half the amount of an\r\ninjury thus, as it was deemed, casually incurred.",
  "p2910.png": "\r\nIt was in the middle ages, at the commencement of the\r\ntwelfth century, that the trials of noxious animals frequently\r\ntook place, conducted with all the solemnity of the law. In\r\nevery instance advocates were assigned to defend the animals.\r\n\r\nThe researches of French antiquaries have brought to light\r\nthe records of ninety-two such legal processes, tried in their\r\ncourts from 1120 to 1741, when the last trial and execution,\r\nthat of a cow, took place. Domestic animals were tried in the\r\ncommon criminal courts, and their punishment on conviction\r\nwas death; wild animals of a noxious description, such as rats,\r\nlocusts, caterpillars, and such like, were conducted in the\r\necclesiastical courts.[*] The proceedings were exceedingly complicated,\r\nand not having the sanction of the Mosaical law, were\r\nbased on the following thesis: As God cursed the serpent,\r\nDavid the mountains of Gilboa, and our Saviour the barren\r\nfig-tree, so, in like manner, the Church had full power and\r\nauthority to exorcise, anathematise, and excommunicate all\r\nanimate and inanimate things. But as the lower animals, being\r\ncreated before man, were the elder-born and first heirs of the\r\nearth, as God blessed them, and gave them \"every green herb\r\nfor meat,\" as they were provided for in the ark, and entitled to\r\nthe privileges of the Sabbath, they must ever be treated with\r\nthe greatest clemency consistent with justice. Some learned\r\ncanonists, however, disputed those propositions, alleging that\r\nauthority to try and punish offences, under the law, implied a\r\ncontract, quasi-contract, pact, or stipulation, between the\r\nsupreme power that made and administered the law, and those\r\nsubjected to it. They contended, that the lower animals being\r\ndevoid of intelligence, no such pact ever had been or could be\r\nmade; and that punishments for injuries committed unintentionally\r\nand in ignorance of the law, were unjust. They questioned,\r\nalso, the authority of the Church to anathematise those\r\n\r\n* The first excommunication fulminated against animals is recorded\r\nin the twelfth century. St. Foix, in his \"Essais historiques sur Paris,\"\r\nstates that the Bishop of Laon pronounced in 1120 an injunction against the\r\ncaterpillars and field-mice, on account of the ravages they made on the\r\ncrops.",

God\r\nrequires that each one should enjoy the product of his labour.\r\nAll that exists was created for man; we should misinterpret the\r\nwisdom of Providence by tolerating animals that are noxious.\r\nReligion permits snares to be laid for birds and other animals,\r\nand the best of all nets is the lightning of anathematisation.\r\n\r\nThe accused animal was committed to prison, at the place of\r\ncriminal justice where the trial was to take place; the procureur,\r\nor officer who exercised the functions of prosecutor at the court,\r\nrequired an act of accusation to be made; after hearing the\r\nwitnesses, and taking down the depositions against the delinquent,\r\nand the crime of homicide being proved, the judge condemned\r\nthe animal to be strangled, and hung by the two back\r\nlegs to an oak tree or a gibbet, according to the custom of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe original course of a process was thus: The inhabitants\r\nof a district being annoyed by certain animals, the court\r\nappointed experts to survey and report on the damage committed.\r\nAn advocate was then appointed to defend the\r\nanimals, and show cause why they should not be summoned.",
  "p2930.png": "\r\nThey were then cited three several times, and not appearing,\r\njudgment was given against them in default. The court then\r\nissued an admonition, warning the animals to leave the district\r\nwithin a certain time, under penalty of adjuration; and if they\r\ndid not disappear on or before the period appointed, the exorcism\r\nwas with all due solemnity pronounced. The courts,\r\nhowever, by every available reason for delay, evaded the last\r\nextremity of pronouncing the exorcism, probably lest the\r\nanimals should neglect to pay attention to it. Indeed, it is\r\nactually recorded that in some instances the noxious animals,\r\ninstead of \"withering off the face of the earth\" after being\r\nanathematised, became more abundant and destructive than\r\nbefore. This the lawyers attributed neither to the injustice of\r\nthe sentence, nor want of power of the court, but to the malevolent\r\nantagonism of Satan, who, as in the case of Job, is at\r\ncertain times permitted to tempt and annoy mankind.\r\n\r\nFrom the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, law reports and\r\nhistory furnish numerous examples of these proceedings in the\r\ncriminal courts; in the cases of pigs and sows more particularly,\r\nwho had devoured children. As one may see at present\r\nin certain localities, these animals in the middle ages ran about\r\nthe streets of villages, and were, it seems, more addicted to\r\neating human flesh than, happily--due to the refinements of\r\ntime--they are now. Some curious instances are given of\r\nthese punishments. In the \"Annuaire du D\u00e9partement de\r\nl'Aisne\" (1812) are full details of the sentence pronounced on\r\na hog (June 14, 1494), by the mayor of St. Martin de Laon,\r\nfor having d\u00e9faci\u00e9 and strangled a child in its cradle. The\r\nsentence concludes thus: \"We, in detestation and horror of\r\nthis crime, and in order to make an example and satisfy justice,\r\nhave declared, judged, sentenced, pronounced, and appointed,\r\nthat the said hog, being detained a prisoner, and confined in\r\nthe said abbey, shall be, by the executioner, hung and strangled\r\non a gibbet, near and adjoining the gallows in the jurisdiction\r\nof the said monks, being near their copyhold of Avin. In\r\nwitness of which we have sealed this present with our seal.\"",
  "p2940.png": "This was done the 14th day of June, in the year 1494, and\r\nsealed with red wax, and upon the back is written, \"Sentence\r\non a hog, executed by justice; brought into the copyhold of\r\nClermont, and strangled on a gibbet at Avin.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale Acad\u00e9mique de\r\nSavoie,\" is a singular account of the law proceedings instituted\r\nin 1587, against a species of beetle, that made great ravages in\r\nthe vineyards of St. Julien, near St. Julien de Maurienne. In\r\n1545 these insects had made an irruption into this territory, and\r\nlegal proceedings were commenced against them. Two lawyers\r\nwere chosen, one by the inhabitants, the other was to defend\r\nthe animals; but singular to relate, the insects suddenly disappeared,\r\nand the law-suit was accordingly abandoned. It was,\r\nhowever, resumed forty-two years afterwards, in 1587, when the\r\nbeetles reappeared, and committed much devastation. The\r\ncourt addressed a complaint to the vicar-general of the Bishop\r\nof Maurienne, who named a judge, and also a lawyer to plead\r\nfor the insects; and published an order prescribing processions,\r\nprayers, etc. After several legal discussions, the inhabitants of\r\nSt. Julien were told the result, that it was necessary to provide\r\na piece of land outside the vineyards where the insects could\r\nlive without infringing on the vines. The piece of land was to\r\nbe of a certain extent, and to contain trees, herbs, etc., in sufficient\r\nquantity and of good quality. In accepting this offer,\r\nthe inhabitants thought it prudent to reserve the right of passage\r\nthrough the locality which they gave up to the insects, \"sans\r\ncauser touttefoys aulcung pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la pasteure desdictz\r\nanimaulx; et par ce que ce lieu est une seure r\u00e9traite en temps\r\nde guerre, vu qu'il est garni de fontaynes qui aussi serviront\r\naux animaulx susdicts,\" or to have the faculty of taking refuge\r\non the land in case of war; promising, on these conditions, in\r\nfavour of the insects, the cession of the land in question, \"en\r\nbonne forme et vallable a perp\u00e9tuyt\u00e9.\"\r\n\r\nThis concession was made June 29 (1587), and on July 4, the\r\ncounsel for the inhabitants presented a request to the court,\r\nthat in default of the defendants accepting the offers that had",
  "p2950.png": "been made to them, the judge would order the vineyards of\r\nthe inhabitants to be respected under certain penalties. The\r\nadvocate for the animals demanded time for deliberation, and\r\nthe trial being resumed in September following, he declared\r\nthat he could not accept, in the cause of his clients, the offer\r\nthat had been made to them, as the locality in question was\r\nbarren, and did not produce anything. This was denied on\r\nthe other side, and arbitrators were named to decide the\r\nquestion. The result is not known, as the manuscript leaves\r\noff at this point; but sufficient particulars have been given to\r\nshow the extremely absurd and curious proceedings of these\r\ntrials of animals in former times.\r\n\r\nDulaure, in his \"History of Paris,\" mentions a legal process,\r\nin 1690, against the caterpillars that laid waste the cultivated\r\nportion of the little town of Pont-du-Ch\u00e2teau in Auvergne. A\r\nvicar, named Burin, excommunicated these caterpillars, and\r\nsent an account of the proceedings to the justice of the district,\r\nwho laid an interdict upon these insects, and solemnly relegated\r\nthem to an uncultivated spot which was duly designated.\r\n\r\nNo district could commence a legal process of this kind\r\nunless all its arrears of tithes were paid up to the Church, and\r\nthis circumstance gave rise to the well-known French legal\r\nmaxim, \"The first step towards getting rid of locusts is the\r\npayment of tithes.\"\r\n\r\nChasseneuz, a celebrated lawyer of the sixteenth century,\r\nwriting on the subject of trying animals by law, in order to\r\nconsole the Beaunois for the plague of locusts (vulgarly called\r\nhuberes), informs them that the creatures of which they complain\r\nwere nothing in comparison to those that infested India. These\r\nlast were no less than three feet long, their legs were armed with\r\nteeth, so powerful that saws were made of them. The best\r\nmeans of deliverance was to pay promptly and truly the tithes of\r\nthe Church, and to cause a woman, barefooted, to walk round\r\nthe infected place.\r\n\r\nThe same means indicated by the lawyer for the inhabitants\r\nof St. Julien de Maurienne, were employed very often and",
  "p2960.png": "successfully, according to some writers; thus the celebrated\r\nlawyer of Zurich, Felix Mall\u00e9olus, or Hemmerlin (died 1457),\r\nrelates that Guillaume de Saluces, who was Bishop of Lausanne\r\nfrom 1221 to 1229, ordered the eels of Lake Leman to confine\r\nthemselves to a certain part, from which they were not to go\r\nout. He relates, also, that in the diocese of Constance, and\r\nin the neighbourhood of Coire, were consigned, \"en une r\u00e9gion\r\nforesti\u00e8re et sauvage,\" larv\u00e6 and Spanish flies, that had been\r\npreviously cited before the provincial magistrate, who, \"taking\r\nin consideration their youth and diminutive size, appointed\r\nan advocate to defend them.\" The same person adds, \"And\r\nat the present time the inhabitants of these districts contract\r\nevery year with the aforesaid insects, and grant them a certain\r\nportion of land which keeps them from passing the limits.\"\r\n\r\nThe tribunals, powerless to punish the insects or other noxious\r\nvermin, acted rigorously against such animals as could be taken\r\nafter wounding or killing anyone. The judicial processes in\r\nsuch cases were the same as those in usage against persons\r\naccused of similar crimes.\r\n\r\nIn 1497, a sow was condemned to be beaten to death for\r\nhaving eaten the chin of a child, belonging to the village of\r\nCharonne. The sentence declared that the flesh of the sow\r\nshould be thrown to the dogs, and that the owner of the animal\r\nand his wife should make a pilgrimage to N\u00f4tre Dame de\r\nPontoise, where, being the day of Pentecost, they should cry\r\n\"Mercy,\" after which they were to bring back a certificate that\r\nthis had been complied with.\r\n\r\nLionnois, in his \"Histoire de Nancy\" (1811), gives a full\r\nreport of the law proceedings on the delivery of a condemned\r\npig to the executioner of Nancy (May 20, 1572). Among\r\nother details the seizure and placing in prison of the animal\r\nare mentioned; that the pig, tied by a cord, had been led to a\r\ncross near the cemetery; that from the most ancient time the\r\njustice of the lord (the Abbot of Moyen-Moutier) was accustomed\r\nto deliver to the provost, or marshal of St. Diez, near\r\nto this cross, the condemned, tous nus, that execution might",
  "p2970.png": "ensue; and by reason that the said pig is a brute beast, the\r\nmayor and justice conferred at that said place, and left the said\r\npig tied with a cord by special grace, and without prejudice to\r\nthe right that belonged to the lord of delivering criminals tous\r\nnus.\"\r\n\r\nThe execution of these animals was public and solemn;\r\nsometimes they were clothed like men. In 1386, the judge of\r\nFalaise condemned a sow to be mutilated in the leg and head,\r\nand afterwards to be hung, for having torn the face and arm,\r\nand then killing a child. This was a Draconian infliction of\r\npunishment. This sow was executed in the public square,\r\nclothed in a man's dress. The execution cost ten sous, six\r\ndeniers tournois, besides a new glove for the executioner. The\r\nauthor of the \"Histoire du Duch\u00e9 de Valois,\" who relates the\r\nsame fact, adds, that the glove is entered in the expenses at six\r\nsous tournois, and that in the receipt given to the Count de\r\nFalaise by the executioner, he declares himself satisfied, and\r\n\"qi'il en quitte le roi notre sire et ledit vicomte!\"\r\n\r\nBulls shared with swine the same mode of trial and punishment\r\nfor homicide. M. Carlier, in his \"Histoire du Duch\u00e9 de\r\nValois,\" relates that a farmer of the village of Moisy allowed\r\nan untamed bull to escape; the consequence was the death of\r\na man, pierced by his horns. Charles, Count of Valois, having\r\nheard of this, gave orders that the bull should be seized and\r\nproceedings taken against the animal. This was done; the\r\nofficers of justice examined witnesses who had seen the man\r\nkilled. The bull was eventually sentenced and hung. But\r\nthis did not terminate the affair; an appeal was made against\r\nthe incompatibility of the retainers of the count to perform the\r\nexecution, to the parliament of the Chandeleur of 1314. After\r\na long discussion it was decided that the bull deserved death,\r\nbut the Count de Valois had no justiciary rights on the territory\r\nof Moisy. In 1499 a bull was hung for having \"par furiosit\u00e9\r\noccis un joine fils de quatorze ou quinze ans,\" in the lordship\r\nof Cauroy, which belonged to the Abbey of Beaupr\u00e9.\r\n\r\nHorses were also judged in the criminal courts. The regis-*",
  "p2980.png": "*ters of Dijon record that in 1389 one was condemned to death\r\nfor having killed a man.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1403, Simon de Baudemont, Lieutenant at\r\nMeulan, Jhean, Lord of Maintenon, the Bailiff of Mantes and\r\nMeulan, signed an attestation making known the expenses\r\nwhich had been incurred in order to execute justice on a sow\r\nthat had eaten a child: \"For expenses within the jail, the\r\ncharge was 6 sols.[*] Item, to the executioner who came from\r\nParis to Meulan, to put the sentence in execution by the command\r\nof our Lord the Bailiff, and of the King's Attorney, 54\r\nsols. Item, for the carriage that conveyed her to execution,\r\n6 sols. Item, for ropes to tie and haul her up, 2 sols 8 deniers.\r\nItem, for gloves 12 deniers; amounting in the whole to 69 sols\r\n8 deniers.\" The item for gloves has puzzled some persons.\r\nSouthey suggests that they were insisted upon by the executioner,\r\nas a point of honour, that no one might reproach him\r\nwith having soiled his hands by performing on such a subject.\r\n\r\nI find, in confirmation of this opinion, that of M. Aguel, in\r\nhis \"Curiosit\u00e9s Judiciaires et Historiques du Moyen Age,\" who,\r\nrepeating the same story of the execution of the sow, adds, \"en\r\noctroyant des gants au bourreau, on voulait, sans doute, d'apr\u00e8s\r\nles m\u0153urs du temps, que ses mains sortissent pures de l'ex\u00e9cution\r\nd'une b\u00eate brute.\"\r\n\r\nThe summonses were served by an officer of the court, reading\r\nthem at the places which the animals frequented. These\r\ncitations were written out with all technical formality, and, that\r\nthere might be no mistake, contained a description of the\r\nanimals. Thus, in a process against rats in the diocese of\r\nAutun, the defendants were described as dirty animals in the\r\nform of rats, of a greyish colour, living in holes. This trial is\r\nfamous in the annals of French law, for it was then that Chasseneuz,\r\nthe famous advocate, won his first laurels. The rats\r\nnot appearing on the first citation, Chasseneuz, their counsel,\r\n\r\n* It is curious to observe that in a receipt delivered (October 16, 1408)\r\nby a notary of Pont de l'Arche to the gaoler of the prison of that town, the\r\ncost of daily food for an imprisoned pig, condemned for killing a child, is\r\nthe same in amount as that for each prisoner in the same gaol per diem.",
  "p2990.png": "argued that the summons was of a too local and individual\r\ncharacter; that, as all the rats in the diocese were interested,\r\nall the rats should be summoned. This plea being admitted,\r\nthe curate of every parish in the diocese was instructed to\r\nsummon every rat for a future day. The day arriving, but not\r\nany rats, Chasseneuz said that as all his clients were summoned,\r\nincluding young and old, sick and healthy, great preparations\r\nhad to be made, and certain arrangements carried into effect,\r\nand he therefore begged for an extension of time. This also\r\nbeing granted, another day was appointed, and again no rats\r\nappearing, Chasseneuz objected to the legality of the summons\r\nunder certain circumstances. A summons from that court, he\r\nargued, implied full protection to the parties summoned, both\r\non their way to it and on their return home; but his clients,\r\nthe rats, though most anxious to appear in obedience to the\r\ncourt, did not dare to stir out of their holes on account of the\r\nnumber of evil-disposed cats kept by the plaintiffs. Let the latter,\r\nhe continued, enter into bonds, under heavy pecuniary penalties,\r\nthat their cats shall not molest my clients, and the summons\r\nwill be at once obeyed. The court acknowledged the\r\nvalidity of this plea, but the plaintiffs declining to be bound\r\nover for the good behaviour of their cats, the period for the\r\nrats' attendance was adjourned sine die, and thus Chasseneuz\r\ngained his cause.[*]\r\n\r\n* A work of Barthel\u00e9mi de Chasseneuz, or Chassen\u00e9e, included in the\r\n\"Concilia D. Bartholom\u00e6i a Chassenes\" (Lugduni, 1588, in folio), is\r\nentitled \"Concilium primum quod tractatus jure dici potest, propter\r\nmultiplicatem et reconditam doctrinam, ubi luculenter, et accurat\u00e8 tractatur\r\nquestio illa: de excommunicatione animalium insectorum.\"\r\n\r\nSome strange notions are contained in this singular work. He contends\r\nthat animals are amenable to trial, and gives an account of indictments\r\nagainst may-bugs and snails, at Autun and Lyons, and of the famous\r\n\"Cause des Rats\" above mentioned. He questions whether animals\r\nshould appear in the courts personally, or by proxy, and declares for the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the insects that ravaged the vineyards of Beaune, he asks:\r\n\"Est-ce un d\u00e9lit? Oui, puisque le peuple en re\u00e7oit des scandales, \u00e9tant priv\u00e9\r\nde boire du vin, qui, d'apr\u00e8s David, r\u00e9jouit le c\u0153ur de Dieu et celui de\r\nl'homme, et dont l'excellence est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par les dispositions du droit",
  "p3000.png": "\r\nThough judgment was given by default, on the non-appearance\r\nof the animals summoned, yet it was considered necessary\r\nthat some of them should be present when the citation was\r\ndelivered. Thus in the case against leeches, tried at Lausanne\r\nin 1451, a number of leeches were brought into court to hear\r\nthe document read which admonished them to leave the district\r\nin three days. The leeches proving contumacious, did\r\nnot leave, and were consequently exorcised.[*] This exorcism\r\ndiffering slightly from the usual form, some canonists adversely\r\ncriticised, while others defended it. The doctors of Heidelberg,\r\nthen a famous seat of learning, gave it their entire and\r\nunanimous approbation, but imposed silence upon all impertinents\r\nthat presumed to speak against it. And, though they\r\nadmitted its slight deviation from the recognised formula made\r\nand provided for such purposes, yet they triumphantly appealed\r\nto its efficiency as proved by the result; the leeches immediately\r\nafter its delivery having died off, day by day, until they\r\nwere utterly exterminated.\r\n\r\nAs the lower animals were anciently amenable to law in\r\nSwitzerland, so, in peculiar circumstances, they could be received\r\nas witnesses. A similar law, it appears, is still, or was\r\nto a very late period, recognised in Savoy. If a man's house\r\n\r\ncanon, portant d\u00e9fense de promouvoir aux ordres sacr\u00e9s celui qui n'aime pas\r\nle vin!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Chasseneuz concludes that an advocate, named by the judge to\r\ndefend the animals, might urge an excuse for their non-appearance by reason\r\nof incompetency, etc.\r\n\r\nA treatise was published even so late as 1668, by Gaspard Bailly, a\r\nlawyer of Chambery, on legal proceedings against animals, with forms of\r\nindictments, modes of pleading, etc.\r\n\r\n* Naud\u00e9 ridicules the occult virtues of talismans in his defence of Virgil\r\naccused of being a magician; the poet, it seems, cast into a well a talisman\r\nof a horse-leech, graven on a plate of gold, to drive away the great number\r\nof horse-leeches which infested Naples. Naud\u00e9 positively denies that\r\ntalismans possessed any such occult virtues. Gaffarel regrets that so\r\njudicious a man as Naud\u00e9 should have gone this length, giving the lie to so\r\nmany authentic authors; and Naud\u00e9's paradox is, indeed, as strange as his\r\ndenial; he suspects the thing is not true, because it is so generally told.\r\n\"It leads one to suspect,\" he observes, \"as animals are said to have been\r\ndriven away from so many places by these talismans, whether they were\r\never driven from any place.\"",
  "p3010.png": "was broken into between sunset and sunrise, and the owner of\r\nthe house killed the intruder, the act was considered a justifiable\r\nhomicide. But it was considered just possible that a\r\nman, who lived all alone by himself, might invite or entice a\r\nperson, whom he wished to kill, to spend the evening with him,\r\nand after murdering his victim, assert that he did it in defence\r\nof his person and property, the slain man having been a burglar.\r\nSo when a person was killed under such circumstances, the solitary\r\nhouseholder was not held innocent unless he produced a\r\ndog, a cat, or a cock that had been an inmate of the house,\r\nand witnessed the death of the person killed. The owner of\r\nthe house was compelled to make his declaration of innocence\r\non oath before one of these animals, and if it did not contradict\r\nhim, he was considered guiltless, the law taking for granted\r\nthe Deity would cause a miraculous manifestation by a dumb\r\nanimal rather than allow a murderer to escape from justice.\r\n\r\nFrom the fourteenth to the sixteenth century the courts of\r\njustice usually adopted the infliction of punishment on animals\r\nproportionate to the injuries they had inflicted. M. Mimaut, in\r\nhis \"Histoire de Sardaigne ancienne et moderne,\" remarks\r\nthat the charter of El\u00e9onore, composed in 1395, and called\r\nCarta di logu, which recites all the civil and criminal laws of\r\nSardinia, states that the oxen and cows, wild or domestic, might\r\nbe killed legally when they were taken in the commission of a\r\ncrime. Asses guilty of the same conduct were treated more\r\nhumanely; they were placed in the same category as thieves.\r\nThe first time that one of these animals was found in a cultivated\r\nfield, which did not belong to his master, one of his ears\r\nwas cut off. A repetition of the offence entailed the loss of the\r\nother ear. If caught a third time in the prohibited place, the\r\nass was not hung like other large animals, but was confiscated\r\nto the prince of the country.\r\n\r\nAt the period mentioned (fourteenth to sixteenth century), it\r\nwas considered that the punishment of the gibbet to an animal\r\nconvicted of homicide would create a horror for the crime, and\r\nthat the proprietor of the animal thus condemned was suffi-*",

Ruchat. It is not inserted as\r\na joke, but given in sober seriousness! 'In 1479 the vicinity\r\nof Lausanne was infested by cockchafers. They were so\r\nnumerous and destructive as to be a thorough pest Mr.\r\nRichardt, the then Chancellor of Berne, advised that a lawsuit\r\nshould be commenced against them. His advice was followed;\r\nand after three processions, the insects were cited to appear in\r\nthe Bishops' Court. For counsel they had assigned to them one\r\nPerrodet, who had been dead six months! The accused and their\r\nadvocate not appearing, the court gave judgment by default.\r\nThe sentence is in Latin, and is preserved in the archives of\r\nLausanne. It excommunicates the insects in the name of the\r\nHoly Trinity and the Blessed Virgin, and they and their descendants\r\nare ordered to quit for ever the diocese of Lausanne.'\"\r\n\r\nThe work of Ruchat contains also another strange story:\r\n\"In 1364 the church of Chattens, in the Jorat Hills, the range\r\nof which Lausanne is the capital, possessed a miraculous\r\nimage of St. Pancrace. A pig having destroyed a child, the\r\naforesaid image was brought out, and the child was restored to\r\nlife. The pig was cited to appear in the Bishops' Court at Lausanne.\r\nIt was found guilty of wilful murder, and sentenced\r\nto death.\" Ruchat says that \"the executioner was a pork-butcher.\"\r\n\r\nWith an abundant share of exorcisms, charms, and enchantments\r\nfor the extirpation of vermin in the olden time, England\r\ndoes not appear to have enjoyed the notoriety of the legal proceedings\r\nagainst animals which we have recorded as prevalent\r\nin foreign countries. There is, however, a curious case of the",
  "p3030.png": "trial of a dog in 1771, near Chichester, which gave rise to a\r\nfacetious parody, a \"Report of the case of Farmer Carter's Dog\r\n'Porter,'\" by Mr. Long, a lawyer who died in 1813. Hone, in\r\nhis \"Every Day Book\" (vol ii.), gives an account of this mock\r\ntrial, somewhat abridged from the original pamphlet, then in\r\nhis possession, but without other alteration, together with a\r\nportrait of the dog \"Porter\" in the dock. The names of the\r\nparties engaged in the real trial are given, with those of the\r\nnicknames in the parody, by which they were called after its\r\npublication. The squires were Butler, Aldridge, Challen, and\r\nBridger. These were understood by J. Bottle, A. Noodle,\r\nMat o' the Mill, and O. Ponser.\r\n\r\nIn Lord Fountainhall's \"Chronological Notes of Scottish\r\nAffairs,\" a curious circumstance is mentioned in connection\r\nwith the boys at Heriot's Hospital, in 1681, during the popular\r\ndemonstrations on the \"Test Act.\" \"At this time many things\r\nwere done in mockery of the Test. One I shall tell. The\r\nchildren of Heriot's Hospital, finding that the dog which kept\r\nthe yards of that hospital had a public charge and office, ordained\r\nhim to take the Test, and offered him a paper. But he,\r\nloving a bone better than it, absolutely refused it. They then\r\nrubbed it with butter, which they called an Explication of the\r\nTest, in imitation of Argyle, and he licked off the butter, but\r\ndid spit out the paper; for which they held a jury upon him,\r\nand in derision of the sentence on Argyle, they found the dog\r\nguilty of treason, and actually hanged him!\"\r\n\r\nTHE reader who is curious on the subject of trials of\r\nanimals, will be interested in the following list of the\r\nvarious proc\u00e8s in France and elsewhere, chronologically arranged\r\nby M.

  "p3060.png": "\r\nCharms and exorcisms for the dispersion or destruction of\r\nnoxious animals prevailed from a remote period, and some\r\nof the superstitions in a modified sense still exist in this country,\r\nand especially abroad. In the middle ages, history makes\r\nfrequent mention of the calamities caused by plagues of insects.\r\nThese were the more destructive as agricultural science, almost\r\nin its infancy at that period, offered few remedies for preventing\r\nor mitigating the ravages. Recourse was consequently had to\r\nthe assistance of the clergy, who heard the complaints, interposed\r\non their behalf with prayers, and anathematised these\r\nenemies of mankind as the work of the devil. In the ecclesiastical\r\ncourts the proceedings were somewhat similar to those of\r\nthe secular tribunals.\r\n\r\nSentence was pronounced (Sept. 6, 1481) against the snails\r\nby Jehan Noseret, canon of Beaujeu, in which was mentioned\r\nthe example given by St. Mammet, Bishop of Vienna, who\r\nexorcised, in this manner, certain devils who had taken the\r\nfigure of wolves and pigs, and had devoured children even in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\nGregory of Tours (573-595) alludes in his \"History\" to\r\ntalismans against mice, serpents, and conflagrations.\r\n\r\nThe suits against animals not unfrequently led to more\r\nserious trials of human beings on charges of sorcery. Simple\r\ncountry people, finding the regular process very tedious and\r\nexpensive, purchased charms and exorcisms from empirical unlicensed\r\nexorcists at a much cheaper rate. But if any of the\r\nparties concerned in this contraband traffic were discovered,\r\ndeath by stake and faggot were their inevitable fate--infernal\r\nsorcerers were not to presume to compete with holy Church.\r\nStill, there was one animal, the serpent, which, as it had been\r\ncursed at a very early period in the world's history, might be\r\nexorcised and charmed (so that it could not leave the spot\r\nwhere it was first seen) by anyone, lay or cleric, without the\r\nslightest imputation of sorcery. The formula ran thus: \"By\r\nHim who created thee, I adjure thee that thou remain in the\r\nspot where thou art, whether it be thy will to do so or otherwise,",
  "p3070.png": "and I curse thee with the curse with which the Lord hath cursed\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nBut if a wretched shepherd was convicted of having uttered\r\nthe following nonsense, termed \"the prayer of the wolf,\" he\r\nwas burned at the stake: \"Come, beast of wool, thou art the\r\nlamb of humility! I will protect thee! Go to the right about,\r\ngrey, grim, and greedy beasts! Wolves, she-wolves, and young\r\nwolves, ye are not to touch the flesh which is here. Get thee\r\nbehind me, Satan!\"\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, the cases of law proceedings\r\nagainst animals became fewer, for the Church at this period had\r\npartially renounced these absurd practices; in the different\r\ndioceses of France, certain prohibitions were issued to correct\r\nthis abuse. Thus, for example, in the Ritual of Evreux of\r\n1606, Cardinal Duperron declares that no one should exorcise\r\nanimals, nor use prayers, or formulas, without his express permission.\r\nThe best theologians of the time also wrote against\r\nthe practice. The canon Ev\u00e9illon published a work in 1651\r\n(Trait\u00e9 des Excommunications), in which, after recapitulating the\r\nabuses and profanity of these proceedings, he adds: \"It is an\r\nassured theological fact that it is only a man who has been baptised\r\nthat can be excommunicated.\" He does not, however,\r\ndiscard exorcisms, which he says can be used towards animals,\r\nin the terms and ceremonies prescribed, without superstition,\r\nand not observing, as formerly, ridiculous law-proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Italy the lower animals were held subject to the\r\nlaws, as in France. Azpilcueta of Navarre, a distinguished\r\nSpanish canonist, asserts that rats when exorcised were ordered\r\nto depart for foreign countries, and that the obedient animals\r\nwould accordingly march down in large bodies to the sea-coast,\r\nand thence set off by swimming in search of desert islands,\r\nwhere they could live and enjoy themselves without annoyance\r\nto man.[*] In Italy also, processes against caterpillars and other\r\n\r\n* In 1459, a Spanish Benedictine monk, Leonard Vair, wrote a work\r\n(De fascino, libri tres), in which he strongly deprecates the excommunication\r\nof animals, describing the ceremonies as superstitious and impious, con-*",
  "p3080.png": "small animals were of frequent occurrence, and certain large\r\nfishes called terons, that used to break the fishermen's nets,\r\nwere annually anathematised from the lakes and headlands of\r\nthe north-western shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy, one of the strongholds of credulity, both past\r\nand present, we have a superstition which prevailed during the\r\neight days preceding Christmas. The people in some of the\r\ncantons placed bundles of hay under the fruit-trees, and children\r\nunder twelve years of age were sent with torches to set fire\r\nto the hay, which they did, crying out:\r\n\r\n\"Taupes, cherilles et mulots\r\nSortez, sortez de mon clos;\r\nOu, je vous br\u00fble la barbe et les os;\r\nArbres, arbrisseaux\r\nDonnez moi des pommes \u00e0 mirlot.\"\r\n\r\nOf this exorcism or charm, a translation may be thus given:\r\n\"Mice, caterpillars, and moles, get out, get out of my field; I\r\nwill burn your beard and your bones; trees and shrubs, give me\r\nthree bushels of apples.\"\r\n\r\nThese incantations are not much unlike those of the ancients\r\nagainst the cantharides, or insects of the beetle kind, by whom\r\nthey thought that their corn was destroyed:\r\n\r\n\"Fly, beetle; the ravenous wolf pursues you.\"\r\n\r\nThe numbers of charms and exorcisms which are used by\r\nprofessional vermin-killers in various parts of France (they are\r\ncertainly not unknown in England), is very great, and their\r\ncharacter is often curious. St. Gertrude of Nivelles is the\r\npatroness of rat-catchers, and in the Ardennes, when rats\r\nbecome unusually troublesome in a house, it is sufficient to\r\nwrite the following words on morsels of paper, which must after[**Looks like room for a missing hyphen for afterwards]\r\nwards be well buttered: \"Rats et rates, vous qui avez mang\u00e9 le\r\nc\u0153ur de Sainte Gertrude, je vous conjure, en son nom, de vous\r\nen aller dans la plaine de Rocroi.\" There are other forms, but\r\n\r\n*sidering that animals are engendered from the rubbish of the earth, and\r\nsubmitting them to the ban of excommunication, was the same as if someone\r\nbaptised a dog or a stone.",
  "p3090.png": "all that is essential is to adjure the rats, or the great king of the\r\nrats, to \"remember\" St. Gertrude. In the crypt of her church\r\nat Nivelles there is a well, the water of which is sought for by\r\nthe peasantry of all the surrounding country, since, sprinkled\r\nin the house, or over the fields, it will drive away all rats and\r\nmice. Earth from the tomb of St. Ulric, at Augsbourg, has\r\nthe same virtue. It is necessary to name a place to which the\r\nrats who are to be expelled can retire, and to take care that, if\r\nthere be any running water in the way, there is a bridge over\r\nwhich they may pass. They should also be adjured to pass\r\nonward in long procession by threes and threes.\r\n\r\nMuch of this turns up again in the old Scotch rhymes, to be\r\npasted against the wall:\r\n\r\n\"Ration and mouse,\r\nLea' the puir woman's house;\r\nGang awa' owre by to the mill,\r\nAnd there ye'll a' get ye'r fill.\"\r\n\r\nTusser, in his \"March Husbandry,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"Kill crow, pie, and cadow, rook, buzzard, and raven,\r\nOr else go desire them to seek a new haven.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Avowynge of King Arther,\" etc, a ballad written, it\r\nis supposed, prior to the reign of Henry VII. (first published by\r\nDr. Whitaker, in his \"History of Craven,\" and afterwards with\r\nsome questionable improvements by Evans, in his \"Old Ballads,\"\r\nunder the title of the \"Felon Sowe and the Freres of Richmonde\"),\r\nwe have an amusing illustration of an abortive exorcism.\r\nSir Walter Scott, in his notes to \"Rokeby,\" gives the entire\r\nballad, with additions and corrections from a manuscript in the\r\npossession of the Rokeby family. This sow--as in most cases\r\nof mischievous animals in the olden time--was supposed to be\r\nunder the influence of the Evil One, and obtained its felonious\r\nappellation from a series of malpractices, unbecoming in an\r\neminent degree even in a sow:\r\n\r\n\"She was more than other three,\r\nThe grisliest beast that e'er might be.\r\nHer head was great and grey;\r\nShe was bred in Rokeby wood,\r\nThere were few that thither goed,\r\nThat came on live away.\"",
  "p3100.png": "\r\nIt seems that Ralph Rokeby gave (for jest's sake apparently)\r\nthis intractable animal to the Convent of Richmond, and the\r\nevil reports of her conduct while left at large, scandalised the\r\nholy men:\r\n\r\n\"Fryar Middleton by his name,\r\nHe was sent to fetch her hame,\r\nThat rued him since full sair.\"\r\n\r\nThe friar with commendable prudence took two others with\r\nhim, but the sow proved too much for them:\r\n\r\n\"She raise up with a felon fare [or fierce countenance],\r\nTo fight against the three.\"\r\n\r\nPeter of Dale, one of the combatants, appears to have been\r\nhard pressed, and in his fright took to exorcising the sow, but:\r\n\r\n\"She bound her boldly to aoide;\r\nTo Peter Dale she came aside,\r\nWith many a hideous yell;\r\nShe gap'd soe wide, and cried so hee [high],\r\nThe Fryar said, 'I conjure thee\r\nThou art a feind of hell.\r\n\r\n\"'Thou art come hither for some traine,\r\nI conjure thee to go againe\r\nWhere thou wast wont to dwell.'\r\nHe sayned [blessed] him with crosse and creede,\r\nTook forth a book, began to reade\r\nIn St. John, his gospell.\r\n\r\nThe spell, however, had no effect:\r\n\r\n\"The sow she would not Latin heare,\r\nBut rudely rushed at the Frear\r\nThat blink'd all his blee [lost his colour];\r\nAnd when she would have taken her hold,\r\nThe Fryar leap'd as Jesus wold,\r\nAnd bealed him [sheltered himself] with a tree.\"\r\n\r\nPeter gave himself up for lost, and bewails his fate:\r\n\r\n\"He sayd, 'Alas, that I was Frear!\r\nAnd I shall be rugged [torn] in sunder here,\r\nHard is my destinie!\r\nWist [knew] my brethren in this houre,\r\nThat I was sett in such a stoure [perilous plight],\r\nThey would pray for me!'\"\r\n\r\nThe three friars take to flight, and",

He tells them:\r\n\r\n\"'We shall for you pray, sing, and read,\r\nTo doomesday with hearty speede,\r\nWith all our progeny.'\r\nThen the letters well was made,\r\nBands bound with seales brade,\r\nAs deedes of armes should be.\"\r\n\r\nThe warriors come off victorious, but not without some severe\r\nhandling by the sow, who is brought in triumph to the convent:\r\n\r\n\"When they saw her come,\r\nThey sung merrily Te Deum,\r\nThe Fryers on that day.\"\r\n\r\nTo prove this glorious feat of arms, and the overthrow of the\r\n\"Felon Sow:\"\r\n\r\n\"If ye will any more of this,\r\nIn the Fryers of Richmond 'tis,\r\nIn parchment good and fine;\r\nAnd how Fryar Middleton that was so kend [kind]\r\nAt Greta Bridge conjured a feind\r\nIn likeness of a swine.\"\r\n\r\nAlbeit, though infused with the Evil Spirit, the \"Felon Sow\"\r\nproved a relish to the friars, given to them by Ralph Rokeby\r\n\"to mend their fare.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a manual assigned to no less a personage than Pope\r\nHonorius III., entitled \"Conjurationes adversus principem\r\ntenebrarum et angelos ejus,\" which is known in its French form\r\nas the Pope's \"Grimoire,\" or book of Gramarye. It contains\r\nnumerous spells and charms, some of them quite unintelligible,\r\nand others very nearly so, from the utter confusion of words\r\nand names. Here is part of a form which is powerful for getting\r\nrid of hares and rabbits, and which, if tried and not found",
  "p3120.png": "wanting, might be acceptable to many an English farmer. Salt\r\nand rabbits' hair must be mixed on a plate; then the operator\r\nis to proceed at sunrise to the place where the charm is to be\r\nworked, and, bareheaded and kneeling, he is to cross the mixture,\r\nand distributing portions into sundry holes, he is to say:\r\n\"Dant, dant, sant. Heliot et Valiot Rouvayet. Viens ici, je te\r\nprends pour mon valet, pour garder pendant trois mois et trois\r\nlunes cette pi\u00e8ce.\" Rouvayet, whoever she or it may be, will\r\nkeep away the rabbits; and as for the hares, the man who has\r\nworked this charm need not fear, even if he should meet one\r\non going to his work in the morning--very unlucky as such an\r\nencounter is otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies attending the exorcism of animals was sometimes\r\naccompanied by a loud clashing of musical instruments;\r\nthus it is mentioned in the life of St. Patrick, that he was unable\r\nwith the most formidable interdicts to drive away a cloud\r\nof bats that had been taken for demons; but what his formulas\r\ncould not effect was done by a deafening sound of cymbals,\r\nwhich drove them away in great fright.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the numerous miracles ascribed to St. Patrick,\r\nwas that of driving the venomous reptiles out of Ireland, and\r\nrendering the Irish soil for ever after so obnoxious to the\r\nserpent race, that they instantaneously die on touching it.\r\nColgan seriously relates, that St. Patrick accomplished this feat\r\nby beating a drum, which he struck with such fervour, that he\r\nknocked a hole in it, thereby endangering the success of the\r\nmiracle; but an angel appearing, mended the drum, and the\r\npatched instrument was long exhibited as a holy relic. The\r\nRev. Alban Butler, however, in his \"Life of St Patrick,\" states\r\nas a popular tradition of the Irish, \"That this benediction was\r\ngiven by his staff, called the 'Staff of Jesus,' which was kept in\r\ngreat veneration at Dublin. The isle of Malta is said to derive\r\na like privilege from St. Paul, who was there bit by a viper.\"\r\n\r\nRibadeneira, the Jesuit author of \"Lives of the Saints,\"\r\naffirms as a most famous miracle, and well known to the whole\r\nworld, \"that St. Patrick did so free Ireland of all venomous",
  "p3130.png": "beasts, that none could ever since live or breathe there; and\r\nthat even the very wood has a virtue against poison, so that it\r\nis reported of King's College, Cambridge, that being built of\r\nIrish wood, no spider doth ever come near it.\"[*]\r\n\r\nThe miracle is related by Jocelin, in his \"Life of St. Patrick,\"\r\nand the story made its way into other tracts, and even into\r\nsome breviaries. No mention of it is, however, found in the\r\nIrish annals and other works long before Jocelin's time.\r\n\r\nThe tradition seems to be disposed of by the testimony of a\r\nwriter long anterior to St. Patrick's time--Julius Solinus--who\r\nstates in his \"Polyhistori\u00e6\" (c. xxiii.), towards the close of the\r\nfirst century, \"Illic (Hibernia) nullus anguis, avis rara, gens\r\ninhospita et bellicosa.\"\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no solid foundation for applying the\r\nlegend of St. Patrick to reptiles of any kind; the allusion more\r\nprobably to a miracle is that of abolishing the idolatrous practices\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hector Boece there were no rats in Buchan\r\n(Aberdeenshire); curiously enough, a later and more intelligent\r\nauthor, Sir Robert Gordon, makes the same statement respecting\r\nSutherlandshire, \"If they come hither in ships from other\r\nparts they die presently, how soon they do smell the air of that\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a prevalent notion in past ages that rats could be\r\nextirpated by a persevering course of anathematising in rhyme.\r\nReginald Scot, in his \"Discoverie of Witchcraft,\" says that the\r\nIrish thought they could rhyme any beast to death; but the\r\nnotion was, in general, restricted to the rat.

The accord, in fine, being made, the Pied Piper\r\nwith a shrill pipe went thorow all the streets, and forthwith the\r\nrats came running out of all the houses in great numbers after\r\nhim; all which he led into the river of Weaser, and therein\r\ndrowned them. This done, and no one rat more perceived to\r\nbe left in the town, he afterward came to demand his reward\r\naccording to his bargain; but being told that the bargain was\r\nnot made with him in good earnest, to wit, with an opinion\r\nthat he could be able to do such a feat, they cared not what\r\nthey accorded unto, when they imagined it could never be\r\ndeserved, and so never be demanded; but, nevertheless, seeing\r\nhe had done such an unlikely thing indeed, they were content\r\nto give him a good reward, and so offered him far less than he\r\nlooked for. He, therefore, discontented, said he would have\r\nhis full recompense according to his bargain; but they utterly\r\ndenied to give it him. He threatened them with revenge;\r\nthey bade him do his worst, whereupon he betakes him again\r\nto his pipe, and going thorow the streets as before, was followed\r\nby a number of boys out of one of the gates of the city, and\r\ncoming to a little hill, there opened in the side thereof a wide\r\nhole, into the which himself and all the children did enter;\r\nand being entered the hill did close up again, and became as\r\nbefore. A boy, that being lame, came somewhat lagging behind\r\nthe rest, seeing this that happened, returned presently\r\nback, and told what he had seen; forthwith began great lamentation\r\namong the parents for their children, and the men were\r\nsent out with all diligence, both by land and by water, to",

If a\r\nbridal procession passes through it, the music must cease until\r\nit is out of it. It is not long since two moss-grown crosses on\r\nthe Koppenberg marked the spot where the little ones vanished.\r\nOn a wall of a house in the town is an inscription in gold\r\ncharacters recording the event, and another memorial on the\r\nRathhaus, and on the new gate. For long so profound was the\r\nimpression produced by the event, that the town dated its public\r\ndocuments from this calamity. Grimm has collected a list of\r\nauthorities who speak of the event as an historical fact.\r\n\r\nSimilar legends of the piper exist in various countries, and\r\nare curious.\r\n\r\nAt one time the fields about Lorch were devastated with\r\nants, and the Bishop of Worms instituted a procession and\r\nlitanies to obtain the deliverance of his people from the plague.\r\nAs the procession approached the Lake of Lorch, a hermit\r\ncame to meet it, and offered to rid the neighbourhood of the\r\nants if the farmers would erect a chapel on the site at the cost\r\nof a hundred guelden. When they consented, he drew forth\r\na pipe, and the sound drew all the insects about him, and he\r\nled them to the water, into which he plunged with them. Then\r\nhe asked for the money, but it was refused. Whereupon he\r\npiped again, and all the pigs followed him; he led them into\r\nthe lake, and they vanished with him.\r\n\r\nNext year a swarm of crickets ate up the herbage. The people\r\nwere in despair. Again they went in procession, and were met\r\nby a charcoal-burner, who promised to destroy the insects if the\r\npeople would expend five hundred guelden on a chapel. Then\r\nhe piped, and the crickets followed him into the water. Again\r\nthe people refused to pay the stipulated sum; upon which the\r\ncharcoal-burner piped all their sheep into the lake.

He\r\npiped them into the Tannenberg, but the farmers buttoned up\r\ntheir pockets; on which the old man piped away their children.\r\n\r\nIn America, some birds and insects were excommunicated.\r\nThe Baron de la Hontan, who, towards the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, passed several years in Canada, relates that the\r\nnumber of doves was so great in that country, the bishop of\r\nMontreal was obliged to excommunicate them several times, on\r\naccount of the damage they had done. (\"Nouveaux Voyages\r\ndans l'Am\u00e9rique Septentrionale,\" 1705.)\r\n\r\nIn Brazil the ants were excommunicated. At the commencement\r\nof the eighteenth century, the monks of the monastery of\r\nSt. Anthony brought an action at law against these insects, to\r\nobtain their removal elsewhere. Father Manoel Bernardes, in\r\nhis \"Nova Floresta\" (published at Lisbon, 1706 to 1728), gives\r\nan account of this singular process, of which the following is a\r\ntranslation: \"Process extraordinary that took place between\r\nthe friars minors of the province of Pietade, in Maranhao, and\r\nthe ants of the said territory. It happened, as related by a\r\nmonk of this order and of this province, that the ants, which\r\nare numerous, very large, and destructive about here, to extend\r\ntheir subterranean territory and to fill their store-houses, had so\r\nundermined the cellars of the friars, in penetrating under their\r\nfoundations, that the building was insecure, and likely to fall.\r\nAdded to this, they stole the grain that was laid up for the\r\ndaily consumption of the convent. As the multitude of these\r\nenemies were indefatigably at work both day and night, the\r\nfriars suffered from hunger, and tried to stop the inroads of the\r\nants, but without success, the number being so great. As a\r\nlast resource, a friar, moved by some superior intelligence, recommended\r\nthat an action should be brought against the ants\r\nbefore the tribunal of Divine Providence, and named certain\r\nlawyers who should plead for and against them, and that their\r\nbishop should be the judge to determine the case. This suggestion[**P3 msg - fixed prev rd]\r\nwas acted upon, and the trial commenced, the lawyer",
  "p3180.png": "for the friars stating the complaint against the ants; and as\r\nit was contested by the legal representative of the ants, he\r\nproceeded to state that as the friars, conformably to the\r\nstatutes of their order, the Mendicant, lived on the contributions\r\nthey collected with great difficulty from the inhabitants\r\nof their district, and that the ants, who were looked\r\nupon as unholy, and for that reason were held in abhorrence\r\nby St. Francis, did not cease to rob them, and not only\r\nacted as thieves, but endeavoured to expulse the friars from\r\ntheir convent and ruin it. In consequence, they were bound to\r\nstate their motives; or if not, they ought all to die of some\r\npestilence, or be drowned by some inundation, or, at least,\r\nshould be exterminated for ever from the district.\r\n\r\n\"The lawyer for the ants alleged in their defence that, having\r\nreceived from their Creator the gift of life, they had a perfect\r\nright to preserve it by all the means that had been granted to\r\nthem; that in the practice and execution of these measures\r\nthey gave to men the example of virtues with which they had\r\nbeen endowed: that is, prudence, in thinking of the future, and\r\nstoring their food for a time of want; also of diligence, in\r\ngathering in this life a recompense for the future, according to\r\nSt. Jerome, 'Formica dicitur strenuus quisque et providus\r\noperarius, qui presenti vita, velut in \u00e6state, fructus justiti\u00e6 quos\r\nin \u00e6ternum recipiet sibi recondit;' of charity, in aiding each\r\nother when the duty was too heavy for their strength; also, of\r\nreligion and piety, in burying their dead; that the labour they\r\nhad in working was much more severe than that which the\r\nplaintiffs could appreciate, for the burden was often greater than\r\ntheir body, but their courage was superior to their strength.\r\nWhile admitting that there were friars more noble and more\r\nworthy, yet before God they were only like ants, and that the\r\nadvantage of reason scarcely compensated their sin in having\r\noffended the Creator, in not observing the laws of reason\r\nas well as they regarded those of nature. It was thus they\r\nrendered themselves unworthy of being served and succoured\r\nby any creature; for they had committed a greater",
  "p3190.png": "crime in acting in so many ways against the glory of God, than\r\nthe ants had done in taking their flour. Also that the ants (the\r\ndefendants) were in possession of the ground before the friars\r\nhad established themselves in the place, and, in consequence,\r\nthey ought not to be expulsed; and they would appeal against\r\nthis violence to the tribunal of their Divine Creator, who made\r\nthe smallest as well as the greatest, and had assigned to every\r\none a guardian angel. In conclusion, the plaintiffs defended\r\ntheir house and their flour by human means which they (the\r\nants) could not contest; but, notwithstanding, the defendants\r\nwould continue their mode of living, as the earth, and all it\r\ncontained, belonged to God, and not to the plaintiffs. Domini\r\nest terra, et plenitudo ejus.\r\n\r\n\"This reply occasioned much discussion, in such wise that\r\nthe lawyer for the friars felt himself constrained to admit that the\r\ndebate had proved the ants to have some right on their side.\r\nSo the judge, after a careful perusal of the evidence, and considering\r\nwith an unbiassed mind what was due to justice, decreed\r\nthat the friars should select a field in their neighbourhood\r\nwhere the ants should be left in possession, the change of\r\ndwelling and removal to take place at once, under pain of excommunication;\r\nseeing that the two parties might thus arrange\r\nmatters between them, without prejudice one to the other, inasmuch\r\nas the friars had come to this part of the country, in a\r\nspirit of obedience, to sow the grain of evangelism, and that\r\nthe work for their maintenance was agreeable to God, whilst the\r\nants might obtain their food elsewhere by their industry, and at\r\nless cost.\r\n\r\n\"This sentence delivered, by order of the judge, a friar went\r\nto deliver it, in the name of the Creator, to the ants, reading it\r\nin a loud voice before the openings of the ant-hills; and marvellous\r\nwas the effect, proving how much the Supreme Being\r\nwas satisfied with this decision, et nigrum campis agmen, immediately\r\nmillions of ants came out, forming themselves in\r\nlong and dense columns, and proceeded direct to the field\r\nassigned to them, abandoning their former dwellings; while the",

An excommunication was there\r\npronounced against the termites, a species of white ant, designated\r\nin that country by the name of comejones, which had introduced\r\nthemselves into a library, and had devoured a great\r\nnumber of books.\r\n\r\nIn the voyages of La Perouse it is stated: \"We found\r\nmillions of cockroaches in the bread-room, so that the holy\r\nfather who officiated as chaplain was obliged to have recourse\r\nto exorcisms more than once.\"\r\n\r\nIn India, scape-goats are sometimes made use of by the\r\nBrahmins to atone for the sins of persons or communities\r\nwhen visited by sickness. The goat is invariably a black one,\r\nand covered with a black cumblie. Garlands are placed around\r\nits neck, and after prayers and invocations have been muttered\r\nover it, it is led to the confines of a neighbouring jungle, to\r\nthe sea-shore, or the limits of the place, and there turned loose.\r\nShould it return, the omen is considered disastrous; but this\r\nis usually prevented by wild beasts, or the fishermen of the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nAmong the glaring inconsistencies of Mohammed's character,\r\nI can never forgive him for cursing the turkey, and thereby\r\ndepriving his followers of a nutritious addition to their larders.\r\nAccording to an Indo-Mohammedan tradition, the prophet, at\r\none time, when at dinner, after various dishes had been served,\r\nhad to wait for the turkey. Enraged at this, he exclaimed,\r\nwhen it at length arrived, \"Throw away the carrion\" (unblessed\r\nflesh), which curse he never afterwards removed.

The saint excommunicated\r\nthem, and the next day all the flies were found dead. Their\r\nbodies covered the pavement. This miracle being spread\r\nabroad, the cursing of the flies became a proverb in the district.\r\n\r\nBishop Kennett says that \"Old Simon Brunsden, of Winterborn\r\nBasset, Wilts, had been parish clerk there from the reign\r\nof Queen Mary to the beginning of James I.

The following account is given by a priest\r\nengaged in the service: \"I went,\" he says, \"during my residence\r\nat Bononia to exorcise the insects in that country, accompanied\r\nby a curate, who was a droll fellow, and laughed at\r\nthe credulity of the people while he pocketed their money.\r\nHe did not tie himself down to the ritual or form prescribed\r\nby the Church, but made his own comments upon everything;\r\nsometimes he spoke to the ants, sometimes to the grasshoppers;\r\nat others to the rats, lizards, and worms.

After them follow\r\nthe other women, one dragging a plough which another\r\ndirects; and a third riding on a broomstick, while the others\r\ncarry and strike together various utensils, chiefly of iron.\r\n\r\nOne of the stories about the Cow-Death relates, that a peasant\r\nwas driving from a mill, at a late hour. Towards him\r\ncomes crawling an old woman, and says: \"Give me a lift,\r\ngrandfather!\" \"Where to?\" \"There, my own, to the village\r\nyou are going to yourself.\" \"And who are you, grandmother?\"\r\n\"A doctoress, my own; I doctor cows.\" \"And where have\r\nyou been doctoring?\" \"Why, I've been doctoring at Istomina's,\r\nbut they're all dead there. What was to be done?\r\nThey didn't call me in till a little time ago, and I couldn't\r\nmanage to stop the thing.\" The peasant gave the woman a\r\nseat on his cart, and drove off. Coming to a cross-road he\r\ncould not remember the way, and by this time it had begun to\r\ngrow dark. Uttering a prayer, the peasant took off his hat and\r\ncrossed himself. In a moment there was no old woman to be\r\nseen! Turning into a black dog, she ran into the village.\r\nNext day, three cows died in the outside farm; the peasant had\r\nbrought the Cow-Death there.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, according to Tereshcenko, instances\r\nof voluntary inhumation have been known. In a\r\nvillage attacked by the epidemic, \"the men and women have\r\nbeen known to cast lots, and the person on whom the lot fell",

Sometimes, however, she takes the form of\r\na black dog, or cow, and, among the Slovenes, a mottled calf.\r\nIn the Tomsk Government, the Siberian murrain is represented\r\nas a tall, shaggy man, with hoofs instead of feet, who usually\r\nlives among the hills. The Bulgarians have a tradition that\r\nwhen the cattle-plague or the small-pox wishes to depart from\r\na village, she appears to some one in his sleep, and orders him\r\nto convey her to such and such a place. The person thus\r\ndesignated takes bread smeared with honey, salt, and a flask of\r\nwine, and leaves them before sunrise at an appointed spot.\r\nAfter this the epidemic disappears, having accompanied the\r\nbearer of the food out of the village.[*]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September a singular funeral ceremony is performed\r\nby the girls in many parts of Russia. They make small\r\ncoffins of turnips and other vegetables, enclose flies and other\r\ninsects in them, and then bury them with a great show of mourning.\r\nAn equally strange custom is the expulsion of tarakans, a\r\n\r\n* Offerings to rats and mice are still prevalent among the peasantry\r\nin certain parts of Germany, if we may credit Grimm and Wolf; and this\r\ncan only be a relic of heathenism, for the significance of the act is lost.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, at Christmas Eve, the remainder of the supper is given to\r\nthe mice, with the words, \"Eat of these crumbs, and leave the wheat.\"\r\n\r\nLambarde, in his \"Perambulation of Kent\" (written in 1570), mentions\r\nthe image of St. Edith, at Kemsing, by whose interference blasting, mildew,\r\nbrand-ear, and other injuries to corn were prevented. The sacrifice was as\r\nfollows: the husbandman who wished to screen his crops from such evil\r\ninfluences, brought a few pecks of corn to the priest, who, after putting by\r\nthe chief part for his own use, took a single handful of the grain, sprinkled\r\nit with holy water, and, \"by mumbling of a fewe wordes of conjuration,\"\r\ndedicated it to St. Edith. He then delivered it back to the farmer, who\r\ndeparted in the full belief that by his mixing the hallowed handful with his\r\nseed-corn, the coming crop would be insured against the deprecated\r\ncalamities.\r\n\r\nLambarde thinks that St. Edith must be regarded as the representative\r\nof the Roman god Robigus, whose office was to protect cereals from those\r\nvery annoyances.",

If this ceremony is\r\nproperly performed, they think it will prevent the tarakans from\r\nreturning.

It was in the form of a large caterpillar of silver;\r\nhollow, and had the back and sides coated with pieces of glass\r\nand composition of various colours, chiefly yellow, with a streak\r\nof dark blue pieces at either side, and red along the back.\r\nThe length was about four and a half inches, and about two in\r\ncircumference. This amulet is an exact imitation in size,\r\ncolour, and appearance, of the caterpillar called by the country\r\npeople the murrain; and from the great dread in which this\r\nanimal is held by them, as being supposed injurious to cattle,\r\nit seems probable that this jewel was used as an amulet. It\r\nwas hired out by the farmers for the purpose of curing the\r\nmurrain.\r\n\r\nAMONG stones of magical virtues to ward off the diseases\r\nof cattle, one belonging to the Waterford family is traditionally\r\nasserted to have been brought from the Holy Land.",

In Spain the\r\nScots were drawn into a combat with the Moors. Douglas was\r\nkilled, and Lochart, who now commanded the party, turned\r\nhomeward with Bruce's heart, which was eventually buried in\r\nthe Abbey of Dunfermline. Lochart (changing his name into\r\nLockhart, to commemorate the event) had taken prisoner a\r\nMoorish chieftain, and the wife of the prisoner when she bargained\r\nfor her husband's ransom, while counting the gold from\r\nher purse, let drop this gem, and appeared so anxious to\r\nrecover it that Lockhart insisted upon its being made a part of\r\nthe ransom. The woman unwillingly consented, and informed\r\nthe greedy Scot that its value consisted in its power of healing\r\ncattle, and that it was also a sovereign remedy against the bite of\r\na mad dog. So great was the popular faith in this talisman in\r\nScotland, that the Lee Penny was exempted from anathema in\r\nthe clerical war against superstitions, after the Reformation,\r\nand the clergy went so far as to extol its virtues, in which\r\nimplicit faith was placed until a comparatively recent period.\r\nThe mode of using this amulet was to hold it by the chain, and\r\nthen plunge it three times in water, and once drawn round--three\r\ndips and a swell, as the country people expressed it; the\r\ncattle drinking the water were cured. In the reign of Charles\r\nI., the people of Newcastle being afflicted with the plague, sent\r\nfor and obtained the loan of the Lee Penny, leaving the sum\r\nof \u00a36,000 sterling in its place as a pledge. They were so\r\nhighly impressed with the virtues of the amulet, that they proposed\r\nto keep it and forfeit the money, but the Laird of Lee\r\nwould not part with it.

She frankly acknowledged\r\nafterwards that she knew no other charm or remedy\r\nthan touching the animal, and going away, repeating these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"My loafe in my lap,\r\nMy pennie in my purse,\r\nThou art never the better,\r\nAnd I am never the worse.\"\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Jumi\u00e9ges there is a singular mode\r\nof curing the diseases of animals, which are supposed to be\r\ncaused by sorcery. Before daylight on St. John's Day, the\r\nvillager goes bare-footed (and taking care not to be seen) to\r\nthe field of a neighbour, and picks up two handfuls of barley,\r\nwhich he binds together like a rope. This is tied round the\r\nbody of the sick animal, and a chapter of St. John's Gospel read.\r\nThe animal thus treated is said to recover immediately.\r\n\r\nA writer to the Antiquary (vol. iii.) from Dublin, says:\r\n\"An aged relative, who spent some years when a girl in the\r\ndomestic service of a farmer in the county Antrim, tells me\r\nthat when a cow dropped a calf, the first food given to her was\r\na sheaf of oats, carefully dried, or rather parched, over the\r\nkitchen fire. Were there no stack in the barn-yard from which\r\na sheaf could be taken, a handful of the grain, parched in\r\nlike manner, was administered instead. Though there may not\r\nappear to be much in this, I suspect that we have here a remnant\r\nof some bloodless sacrifice or other, dating, it may be, for\r\na long time before the existence of either Lutetia, Rome, or\r\neven Mycen\u00e6.\r\n\r\n\"The same informant tells me, moreover, of a strange cere-*",
  "p3320.png": "*mony which she has sometimes seen carried out on a cow unable\r\nor unwilling to let down her milk. None could officiate\r\nhere but those endowed with special gifts, received in direct\r\nsuccession from a line of sacerdotal predecessors, nobody\r\nknows how long. In the neighbourhood where my friend's\r\nhome was, the medium between the unseen powers and earthly\r\nthings was an old woman of whom all youngsters had an eerie\r\ndread, and who for any professional work never would permit\r\nher hands to be defiled by touching the current coin of the\r\nrealm. Meal, potatoes, and such-like, might be taken, but no\r\nmoney. The armoury wherewith she defied the evil eye, or\r\nother occult powers, was of the simplest, being nothing more\r\nthan a hank of 'green,' that is unbleached, linen thread, and\r\na pint or two of a solution of salt and water. With sundry\r\nmysterious mutterings, the yarn was wound nine times round\r\nthe body of the animal, and then, with more mutterings, was the\r\nsalt and water sprinkled along its back. Last of all, no doubt, there\r\nwould come the old crone's fee, a guerdon given, I dare say,\r\nwith a thankfulness greater far than any veterinary surgeon of\r\nthis mechanical age is ever likely to experience. A noteworthy\r\npoint about the matter is this--that, unlike other priestcrafts,\r\nthis gift of charming away disease was believed, throughout the\r\ndistrict, to be conveyable only from 'a woman to a man, or vice\r\nvers\u00e2.'\"\r\n\r\nOn Rood-Day, many persons in Scotland hang up branches\r\nof the rowan-tree (mountain ash) above the doors of their cow-houses,\r\nand tie them round the tails of their cattle with scarlet\r\nthreads. Indeed, great attention to their cows is supposed to\r\nbe necessary, as witches and fairies might be at work in milking\r\nthe tether--an expression which implies a power possessed by\r\nwitches of carrying off the milk of any person's cows by pretending\r\nto perform the operation upon a hair tether. This\r\nabsurd notion prevailed in the Hebrides, that women, by a certain\r\ncharm, or by some secret influence, could withdraw and\r\nappropriate to their own use the increase of their neighbours'\r\ncows' milk. It was believed, however, that the milk so charmed",
  "p3330.png": "did not produce the ordinary quantity of butter usually churned\r\nfrom other milk, and that the curds of such milk were so tough\r\nthat they could not be made so firm as the others, and that\r\nit was also much lighter in weight. It was also believed that\r\nthe butter produced from the churned milk could be discovered\r\nfrom that yielded by the churner's own milk by difference in the\r\ncolour, the former being a paler hue than the latter. The\r\nwoman in whose possession butter so distinguished was found\r\nwas considered guilty. To bring back the increase of milk it\r\nwas usual to take a little of the rennet from all the suspected\r\npersons, and put it into an egg-shell full of milk; and when the\r\nrennet taken from the charmer was mingled with it, it was said\r\npresently to curdle, but not before. Some women put the root\r\nof groundsel among their milk as an amulet against such\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\nThis superstition was not confined to Scotland and its islands,\r\nbut still prevails in Sweden, and was not wholly unknown in\r\nthe north of England. Another credulity in the north of Scotland,\r\nrelating to May Day, is that on Maunday Thursday the\r\nherdsmen cut pieces of wood from the rowan-tree, and put\r\nthem into one end of a staff. These staves were laid by until\r\nthe first of May, when they fixed them over the doors of their\r\nsheep-cots, fancying that they would preserve the cattle from\r\ndiseases until the following May. This was a custom practised\r\namong the Greeks.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a statement (June, 1879) of Dr. Wilkinson,\r\nthe ex-Bishop of Zululand, that the Zulus have strong notions\r\nof their cattle, when ill and diseased, being attacked by witchcraft.\r\nIt appears that a chief's cattle had lung disease, and\r\nwhen he called the doctors about them, they said the cattle had\r\nbeen bewitched by a family to whom the ex-King, Cetewayo,\r\nwas hostile, on account of their becoming Christians. A band\r\nof armed men was sent to kill them, but they contrived to\r\nescape and conceal themselves.",
  "p3340.png": "\r\n[** no indent]RAWLINSON, in his \"Five Great Monarchies of the\r\nAncient Eastern World,\" alludes to an implement\r\nwhich the priests of Media commonly bore, called the\r\nKhraf\u00e7thraghna, or instrument for killing bad animals--frogs,\r\ntoads, snakes, mice, lizards, flies, etc--which belonged to the bad\r\ncreation, or that which derived its origin from Angr\u00f4-mainyus\r\n(the great spirit of evil). These it was the general duty of all\r\nmen, and the more especial duty of the Zoroastrian priests, to\r\nput to death whenever they had the opportunity. The Magi,\r\nit appears, adopted this Arian usage, added the Khraf\u00e7thraghna\r\nto the bursom (a bundle of thin tamarisk twigs), and were so\r\nzealous in their performance of the cruel work expected from\r\nthem as to excite the attention, and even draw upon themselves\r\nthe rebuke, of foreigners.\r\n\r\nIt was a medi\u00e6val practice in Germany and Scandinavia to\r\nhang wolves and dogs with a criminal, as a symbolical mark of\r\ndisgrace, and as an aggravation of his punishment Saxo Grammaticus\r\nstates that the association of wolves at the hanging of\r\na criminal was an ancient punishment for parricide; and in Germany\r\nthe practice of hanging dogs with the sufferer was particularly\r\napplied to Jews.\r\n\r\nRovarius, a papal nuncio at the court of Hungary in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, in a treatise to prove that animals are rational,\r\nand that they make a better use of their reason than man, states\r\nthat it was customary in Africa to crucify lions, in order to deter\r\nthem from entering towns; and he had himself seen two wolves\r\nhung from a gibbet in the forest between Cologne and Juliers,\r\nas an example to other wolves.\r\n\r\nAmong the Bedouins, some kinds of animal flesh have a\r\nmagical virtue attached to them. A man who suffers in any\r\nmember of his body seeks a cure by eating the corresponding\r\npart of a hy\u00e6na. The hy\u00e6na is also eaten in the neighbourhood\r\nof Suez. A similar virtue attaches to the flesh of the\r\ngemsbok (Wudheyhy), a rare species of antelope found in the\r\ninterior. When eaten it draws an obstinate bullet from the\r\nwound!",

They say that the very moment this reptile hears a\r\nperson talk, it cocks its tail and listens attentively. They say\r\nalso it is meritorious to kill the reptile, and that the person\r\nwho destroys it obtains an indulgence of forty days. They\r\nallege that this is the reptile that \"spied\" on our Saviour,\r\nand they tell the following story: Our Saviour, when on His retreat\r\nfrom His pursuers, while passing on His way, told those\r\nwho were sowing that if anyone passed and inquired for Him,\r\nto say that He passed the day when they were sowing the crop.\r\nIt appears they sowed one day, and reaped the next day. The\r\ndar-daoal was in the ditch, and said \"A na\u00e9, a na\u00e9\" ('Yesterday,\r\nyesterday'), thus intimating that the Saviour had passed the day\r\nbefore. The Lord took the wings off the dar-daoal, which has\r\nbeen without wings from that day to this. The dar-daoal is said\r\nto be the first creeping thing that enters the grave, when it cuts\r\nthe tongue from the corpse.\r\n\r\nFROM the trial of animals for alleged misdemeanour, and\r\nblessing them, is a wide transition; but such appears to\r\nhave been the case for several ages, and exists in a modified\r\nsense at the present time. On St. Anthony's Day, the beasts at\r\nRome were blessed and sprinkled with holy water. Lady\r\nMorgan, in her \"Italy,\" remarks that the annual benediction of\r\nthe beasts at Rome, in a church dedicated to St. Anthony,\r\nlasted for some days; \"for not only every Roman from the\r\npope to the peasant, who has a horse, a mule, or an ass, sends\r\nhis cattle to be blessed at St. Anthony's shrine, but all the\r\nEnglish go with their job horses and favourite dogs; and for\r\nthe small offering of a couple of pauli, get them sprinkled, sanctified,\r\nand placed under the protection of the saint. Coach\r\nafter coach draws up, strings of mules mix with carts and\r\nbarouches, horses kick, mules are restive and dogs snarl, whilst\r\nthe officiating priest comes from his little chapel, dips a brush\r\ninto a vase of holy water, sprinkles and prays over the beasts,\r\npockets the fees, and retires.\"",
  "p3360.png": "\r\nDr. Conyers Middleton says, that when he was at Rome he\r\nhad his own horses blessed for eighteenpence, as well to satisfy\r\nhis own curiosity as to humour his coachman, who was persuaded\r\nthat some mischance would befall them in the year, if\r\nthey had not the benefit of the benediction.\r\n\r\nThe Roman peasant still clings to the belief that the saint\r\nhas power to keep his horse from harm, and it is to get their\r\nanimals blessed by the priest in St. Anthony's name, that causes\r\nhis festival at Rome to be a busy scene. Mr. Weld, in his\r\n\"Last Winter at Rome,\" says: \"All day long, horses, mules,\r\nand donkeys are led up before a porch adjoining the church,\r\nwhere stands a priest, who delivers in bad Latin the following\r\nblessing: 'May this (or those) animal (or animals) receive thy\r\nbenediction, through which they may be preserved bodily, and\r\nbe freed from all evil through the intercession of blessed San\r\nAntonio!' At the conclusion of the blessing, the beast or\r\nbeasts are sprinkled with holy water and led away. Devout\r\npeasants, previous to having their animals blessed, enter the\r\nchurch to offer up a prayer before the shrine of San Antonio.\r\nIn all cases it is customary, though not obligatory, to make an\r\noffering to the priest who blesses the animals and sprinkles\r\nthem with holy water, and who, in return, presents the owner of\r\nthe animal with a portrait of St. Anthony and a small metal\r\ncross.\"\r\n\r\nPeasants are in the habit of decorating their animals for this\r\nceremony with artificial flowers and ribbons. The festival lasts\r\neight days. There is a quaint picture in the Borghese Gallery\r\nrepresenting St. Anthony preaching to a great variety of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies in Spain, on the celebration of St. Anthony's\r\nDay, were somewhat similar to those observed at Rome. The\r\nproceedings at Madrid consisted of the blessing of horses and\r\nmules. The coachmen with their horses and mules cleaned\r\nand well-trimmed, stopped before the church of St. Anthony,\r\neach man having a certain quantity of barley with him, half of\r\nwhich was to be given to the church. A monk appeared; the",

A kind of procession with\r\nhorses, mules, and carriages drove round St. Anthony's church,\r\nmen and beasts decorated with ribbons and flowers. The crowd\r\nthrew sweetmeats and oranges at each other, and diverted themselves\r\nin honour of the saint.\r\n\r\nSt. Anthony early acquired a reputation in Italy for his\r\nanimal-protecting powers. In 341 he introduced monastic life\r\ninto Rome, and created the order of San Antonio, which, among\r\nvarious privileges, enjoyed that of keeping consecrated pigs, fed\r\nat the public expense. To steal one of these animals was considered\r\na heinous sin, and as they fed well and became sleek,\r\nthe proverb arose, \"As fat as a pig of St. Anthony.\"[*]\r\n\r\nFuller, in his \"Worthies,\" says: \"St. Anthony is universally\r\nknown for the patron of hogs, having a pig for his page in\r\nall pictures, though for what reason is unknown, except because\r\nbeing a hermit, and having a cell or hole digged in the\r\nearth, and having his general repast on roots, he and hogs did\r\nin some sort enter commons both in their diet and lodging.\"\r\n\r\n* Mr. W. H. J. Weale, in \"Notes and Queries,\" says: \"In the archives\r\nof Flanders I have met with many instances of pigs, cows, donkeys, dogs,\r\nand other animals being sentenced to death during the fourteenth, fifteenth,\r\nand sixteenth centuries. Thus, in the accounts of the Treasurer of the\r\nLiberty of Bruges for 1518, 1519, fol. xix, v and xx., we find different items\r\nof expenses caused by the inquest held on the body of a child, aged three\r\nmonths, son of the verger of the Church of Our Lady at Bruges, that had\r\nbeen bitten to death by a pig in the parish of Couckelacre. The pig was\r\nfound guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging, which sentence was\r\nexecuted on the 22nd of November, 1518, in the presence of one of the\r\nmagistrates. On the 17th of August, 1519 (fol. xxx. v), a cow, 'daermede\r\neen persoon, daer te vooren ooc ghe-executeert, hem gheniesuseert hadde,\"\r\nwas burnt to death outside the Holy Cross, in presence of two of the\r\nmagistrates. If the cannibal pig above mentioned had belonged to the\r\nmonks of St. Anthony, whose swine, distinguished by a T cross, were\r\nallowed to roam about at liberty, the civil authorities could not have condemned\r\nit to death without having first had the case tried in the court of\r\nthe ecclesiastical ordinary.

They prayed\r\nher to bless the sheep, and sprinkled them with water. The\r\nchief difference between the forms seems to have been, that the\r\nancient Romans let the sheep remain in their folds, while the\r\nmoderns drove them into the church.\r\n\r\nBaal-Zebub, the name of a god who had a temple of some\r\nsort in the city of Ekron (2 Kings i. 2), was the tutelary deity\r\nthat protected the people from the plagues of gnats.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Olympia and Elis had, in like manner,\r\ntheir protecting deities; the Trojans their Apollo, from his\r\nhaving destroyed mice; the inhabitants of Mount \u0152eta, their\r\nHercules, to protect them from the locusts, and the Erythreans\r\ntheir god, who destroyed vermin.\r\n\r\nThe sacred pigs of the ancients (as well as other animals)\r\nwere those intended for immolation.

These consecrated animals were afterwards\r\nshorn, and palls made from their fleeces; for each of which, it\r\nis said, the pope exacted of the bishops from eight to ten or\r\nthirty thousand crowns.\r\n\r\nThis custom, somewhat modified, exists at the present time\r\nat Rome, for we read in a public journal (the Standard,\r\nJanuary 23, 1879), that on the f\u00eate of St. Agnes (January 22),\r\nthe pope (Leo XIII.) \"received, according to immemorial\r\ncustom, the two white lambs which are due from the Basilica\r\nof St. Agnes to the Lateran Chapter.

Why this should be is matter for conjecture.\r\nIt may arise from a combination of qualities peculiar to\r\nbirds. From being continually on the wing, they were supposed\r\nto observe and to know the most hidden actions of men,\r\nand to be acquainted with all secrets. Hence the proverb,\r\n\"No one knows except, perhaps, some bird.\" A modern\r\nwriter observes: \"The very paradise of nature is the birds:\r\nthe gracefulness of their form, the exquisite delicacy of their\r\ncovering, the inimitable brilliancy of their colours, the light and\r\nlife-giving transparency of the element in which they live, the\r\nsingular variety of their habits, and the delightful melody of\r\ntheir songs.\" \"Ibi aves, ibi angeli,\" is a dogma of Thomas\r\nAquinas, which he was fond of quoting. To this I may add,\r\nthe remarkable caution and foresight of some birds, the cunning,\r\nartifice, and dissimulation, seem to account for the fables,\r\nlegends, and romances connected with them from the earliest\r\ntimes.[*]\r\n\r\n* Under much apparent buffoonery, the play of the \"Birds\" by Aristophanes\r\ndiscovers the most profound mysteries of the Athenian politics--the\r\ndivers movements which agitated Greece--in a word, the secret history\r\nof the Peloponnesian war.\r\n\r\nAll that was remarkable in the stories about birds in natural history, in\r\nmythology, in the love of augury, in \u00c6sop's \"Fables,\" or even in proverbial\r\nexpressions, the poet has ingeniously blended in this poem.",
  "p3430.png": "\r\nBirds, being supposed to be milder than beasts by nature,\r\nare employed by old writers to represent the better class of\r\nmen. The idea of the excellence of birds seems to have been\r\ndue to the expression \"volucres c\u0153li,\" the birds of heaven, in\r\nMatthew viii. 20. In the \"Ancren Riwyle,\" a treatise on the\r\n\"Rules and Duties of Monastic Life\" (a semi-Saxon MS. of\r\nthe thirteenth century, published by the Camden Society), we\r\nhave true anchoresses compared to birds: \"For they leave the\r\nearth; that is the love of all earthly things; and through yearning\r\nof heart after heavenly things, fly upwards towards heaven.\r\nAnd although they fly high, with high and holy life, yet they\r\nhold the head low, through meek humility, as a bird flying\r\nboweth down its head, and accounteth all her good deeds and\r\ngood works nothing worth.... True anchoresses are indeed\r\nbirds of heaven, that fly aloft and sit on the green boughs\r\nsinging merrily.\"\r\n\r\nIn the story of \"Nella-Rajah,\" we find that in the world of\r\nDaivers or Genii, there are milk-white birds called Aunnays,\r\nremarkable for the gracefulness of their walk, wonderfully\r\nendowed with knowledge and speech, incapable of deceit, and\r\nhaving power to look into the thoughts of men.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh have a tradition concerning the birds of Rhianon,\r\na female personage who has a principal part in carrying on the\r\nspells in Gwladyr Hud, or the Enchanted Land of Pembrokeshire.\r\n\"Whoso happened to hear the singing of her birds\r\nstood seven years listening, though he supposed the while that\r\nonly an hour or two had elapsed.\"\r\n\r\nPlutarch tells us that the Egyptians adored some image of\r\nthe divine faculties in animals--patience, utility, vivacity, etc.\r\nThus the IBIS (religiosa) was reared in their temples and embalmed\r\nafter death. It was worshipped because, as some said,\r\nit devoured the serpents, which, otherwise, would have become\r\ndangerous to the country; others attributed the divine honours\r\npaid to it, from a resemblance between its plumage and some\r\nof the phases of the moon. The shape of its body was supposed\r\nto represent the heart; its legs described a triangle, and",
  "p3440.png": "with its beak it performed a medical operation. But perhaps a\r\nmore reasonable idea of its value was announcing by its advent\r\nthe rising of the Nile. No wonder, therefore, that to slay or\r\ninsult the ibis was a crime of the darkest hue. As it did not\r\nmake its nest in Egypt it was supposed to be a self-engendering\r\nbird. In this respect it had a compeer in the PH\u0152NIX. The\r\nRabbins tell us that all the birds having complied with the first\r\nwoman, and with her, having eaten of the forbidden fruit, except\r\nthe ph\u0153nix, as a reward it obtained a sort of immortality.\r\nThis bird was said to live five hundred years in the wilderness,\r\nthen making a nest of spices, it was lighted by the wafting of\r\nits wings, and the body was consumed. From the ashes arose\r\na worm which grew up to be a ph\u0153nix. Like the dying swan,\r\nthis bird sang a funeral dirge, thus Moore (\"Paradise and the\r\nPeri\") alludes to\r\n\r\n\"The enchanted pile of that lonely bird\r\nWho sings at the last his own death-lay,\r\nAnd in music and perfumes dies away.\"\r\n\r\nThe ph\u0153nix probably owed its imaginary existence to the\r\nEgyptians. It was a type of the renovation of the year, and of\r\nthe sun; also a symbol of the deluge, when nature recovered\r\nfrom the fearful catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"The myth of the ph\u0153nix\" (remarks Mr. George Stephens in\r\n\"Arch\u00e6ologia,\" vol. xxx. p. 256), \"is one of the most ancient\r\nin the world. Originally a temple type of the immortality of\r\nthe soul, its birthplace appears to have been the sunny clime of\r\nthe fanciful and gorgeous East. Even in the days of Job and\r\nDavid it was already a popular tradition in Palestine and\r\nArabia. Afterwards it passed over to Egypt, Greece, and\r\nRome; but, as it went, lost feather after feather, until the\r\nspiritual, delicate, and beautiful parable sank into the tangible\r\nfolk-legend of a nine days' wonder. The fathers of the Christian\r\nChurch were the first to restore it to its original form and\r\nhidden meaning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon, Beda the Venerable, follows in his exposition\r\nof Job's twenty-ninth chapter (the Rabbins translate our",
  "p3450.png": "rendering of the eagle as kol or ph\u0153nix) the Rabbinical school\r\nof interpretation. The latter thus became known among our\r\nown forefathers, and one of them has beautifully employed this\r\npassage in applying the great doctrine he sought to establish.\r\n\r\nAmong the early Christians the ph\u0153nix was the type of our\r\nSaviour in His resurrection.[*]\r\n\r\nHerodotus describes the ph\u0153nix (which, however, he admits\r\nhe had never seen except in pictures): \"The plumage is\r\npartly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are\r\nalmost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story (in Egypt)\r\nof what this bird does, which appears incredible, that he comes\r\nall the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered\r\nover with myrrh, to the Temple of the Sun, and there buries\r\nthe body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a\r\nball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he\r\nhollows out the ball and puts his parent inside, after which he\r\ncovers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then\r\nexactly of the some weight as at first, so he brings it to Egypt,\r\nas I have said, and deposits it in the Temple of the Sun.\"\r\n\r\nAriosto alludes to this fable in the voyage of Astolfo:\r\n\r\n\"Arabia, named the Happy, now he gains:\r\nIncense and myrrh perfume her grateful plains;\r\nThe virgin ph\u0153nix there in need of rest,\r\nSelects from all the world her balmy nest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Tempest,\" Sebastian says:\r\n\r\n* The peacock, as an emblem of the Resurrection, supplanted the ph\u0153nix.\r\nNot only does it thus appear on monuments and in windows, but, as we\r\nlearn from the writings of Anastasius, the variegated feathers of the bird, or\r\nimitations of them in embroidery, were often used in early times as decorations\r\nin churches. The wings of angels, also, were often represented as\r\nformed of the feathers of the peacock. There was an old idea as to the incorruptibility\r\nof the flesh of the peacock, which may have suggested the\r\nadoption of this bird as a symbol of triumph over death and the grave.\r\nThe appropriation of the peacock in its more obvious significance, as a type\r\nof worldly pride, would appear to be of more modern date.\r\n\r\nAlexander, by a decree, denounced death against whoever killed the\r\ndivine peacock. This decree, however, did not affect Quintus Hortensius,\r\nwho had one served up at the dinner which celebrated his accession to the\r\noffice of Augur.",

After it has done that, immediately\r\nit goes, and it is so strong of limb it comes to a city, which is\r\nHeliopolis, where it repairs always--then it begins to announce\r\nthat it wishes to be made young again. There is an altar, I\r\ndo not think there is another like it; a priest in such manner\r\ndoes service to the bird, that he understands the cry that\r\nhe has heard from it; that it wishes to become young again,\r\nand leave its old age; in March or in April the beautiful bird\r\ndoes that.\r\n\r\n\"The priest collects spices; burns it upon the altar, and\r\nthe Ph\u0153nix comes flying, and puts itself in the burning fire.\r\nWhen the spice is burnt, and the bird likewise, the clerk\r\ncomes to the altar, you will never hear of such a one; there\r\nhe finds a vermin; softly it went very little; on the second\r\nday he returns; it has the form of a bird. When he repairs\r\non the third day, he finds the bird bigger; it is all\r\nmade and formed; to the clerk it says so much, vale; that\r\nis, God save thee. Then it repairs to the wood, from whence\r\nit formerly turned when it burnt itself. Know, that is its\r\nlot, it comes to death of its own will, and from death it comes\r\nto life; hear what it signifies: Ph\u0153nix signifies Jesus, the Son\r\nof Mary; that He had power to die of His own will, and\r\nfrom death came to life. Ph\u0153nix signifies that to save His\r\npeople He chose to suffer on the cross. Ph\u0153nix has two\r\nwings; there is a meaning in it; by these wings are meant\r\nthe two laws, truly, the old law and the new, which is very\r\nholy and beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Jane Seymour lies buried in St. George's Chapel,",

Old naturalists describe them as being destitute of\r\nfeet, dwelling in the air, without an abiding place, nourished\r\nby dew, vapour, and the odours of flowers. Tavernier relates,\r\n\"that they come in flocks during the nutmeg season to the\r\nsouth cities of India. The strength of the nutmeg intoxicates\r\nthem, and while they lie in this state on the earth, the ants eat\r\noff their legs!\" Moore adopted this notion in his \"Lalla\r\nRookh\":\r\n\r\n\"Those golden birds that in the spice-time drop\r\nAbout the gardens, drunk with that sweet fruit\r\nWhose scent hath lur'd them o'er the summer flood.\"\r\n\r\nThe natives of New Guinea and the neighbouring islands\r\nlooked upon the skins of these birds as sacred, and as charms\r\nagainst the dangers of war. In preparing them, the legs of the\r\nbird were cut off in such a manner as gave rise to the idea,\r\nwhen the skins were exported from the islands, that the birds\r\nwere legless.[*]\r\n\r\nJ. Berkenhead to Fletcher, says very prettily:\r\n\r\n\"But thou art still that Bird of Paradise\r\nWhich hath no feet, and ever nobly flies.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis Thynne, in his \"Emblemes and Epigrames\" (1600),\r\nhas:\r\n\r\n\"There is a birde which takes the name\r\nof Paradise the fair,\r\nWhich allwaies lives, beatinge the winde\r\nand flienge in the Ayre,\r\n\r\n* Jonathan Carver mentions of the Wakon bird, as it is termed by the\r\nIndians, and which appears to be of the same species as the birds of\r\nparadise, that the name given to it is expressive of its superior excellence,\r\nand the veneration they have for it; the Wakon bird being in their language\r\nthe bird of the Great Spirit.",

The chirpers\r\nwere called oscines (os, a mouth; cano, I sing); and such as\r\nindicated events by their flight were termed pr\u00e6petes (to fly\r\nforward). The crow, the raven, and the owl were among the\r\nformer; the eagle and the vulture among the latter; some, as\r\nthe pye, belonging to both classes. Birds were also otherwise\r\ndivided into classes, such as sinistr\u00e6, which permitted an attempt;\r\nfor the oscines on the left, it is said, were always favourable.\r\nFunebres, ill-omened, which were also called arcul\u00e6\r\n(arceo), I drive away); clivi\u00e6 (clivus, a difficulty); remor\u00e6 (remoro,\r\nI delay); inebr\u00e6 (inhibeo, I stop); alter\u00e6 (if they interfered\r\nwith a former good omen); and volsgr\u00e6 (vello, I pluck) if\r\nby plucking their own feathers they portended ill.\r\n\r\n\"Of these two auguries, those by flight\" (observes Montaigne)\r\n\"were the most certain, and we have nothing like it, nor anything\r\nso much to be desired; but that rule and order of the\r\nmoving of the wing, from whence they derived the consequences\r\nof future things, must, of necessity, be guided by some excellent\r\nmeans, concert, and meditation of him by whom it is produced,\r\nis an opinion evidently false.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt of it, and the augurial ceremonies would have been\r\nmore impressive if the \"chance,\" such as it appeared to be, had\r\nbeen left to the peculiarities of the birds themselves; but the\r\naugurs, who were mere political tools, rendered their decisions,",

Here a tent was fixed, and the\r\naugur, clad in a white robe, with a gold crown on his head, first\r\nmarked out with the carved lituus, or wand, a division in the\r\nheavens within which he intended to make his observations.\r\nA profound silence was enjoined on everyone, as the least interruption\r\nwas thought fatal to the trial. Auspices taken from\r\nthe feeding of chickens were specially employed in military\r\nexpeditions. The pullarius, who had charge of the fowls,\r\nopened the cage and threw to them pulse, or a soft cake. If\r\nthe chickens refused to come out, or uttered a cry, or beat their\r\nwings and flew away, the sign was considered unfavourable;\r\non the contrary, if they ate greedily, so that something fell from\r\nthe mouth, and struck the earth, it was considered a favourable\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nWhilst it was only a few birds which could give auguries of\r\ngreat events and importance to the state, every inhabitant of\r\nthe air had its attribute, and of all these the eagle was in most\r\nrepute. One of these, when seen from the right, and more\r\nespecially if it flew with outstretched and clanging wings,\r\nbetokened prosperity. Homer, in this, agreed with the Romans.\r\nWhen Priam set forward to entreat Achilles for the body of\r\nHector, this was the very omen for which, by the advice of",

An eagle on the right uttering\r\nits note while sitting, was pronounced by an Ephesian augur to\r\nappertain to the fortunes of a man who should fill a public\r\noffice, since it was a bird of command. The office was to be\r\nattended with danger, since other birds attack a sitting eagle;\r\nand it was not to be lucrative, since an eagle collected its prey\r\nwhile on the wing. The fate of Xenophon verified these predictions.\r\nThe eagle which took off the cap of the elder Tarquin,\r\nand placed it again on his head, portended to him his future\r\nsovereignty; while the young brood, which was driven from its\r\nfeed by vultures, and torn in pieces with its eyrie, equally foretold\r\nto its proud descendant his exile and dethronement.\r\nBefore the abdication of the Syracusan Dionysius, it was said\r\nthat an eagle had snatched a javelin from the hands of one of\r\nhis bodyguards, and after bearing it aloft, had dropped it into\r\nthe sea. Claudius and Vitellius each drew encouragement\r\nfrom an eagle; and a victory which Domitian had won over\r\nAntony, his rebellious lieutenant of Upper Germany, though\r\nthe field of battle was 2,500 miles distant, was announced at\r\nRome on the very day of the triumph itself by an eagle, which\r\nalighted on the conqueror's statue and uttered cries of joy--nay,\r\nsome spectators of warmer imagination believed that the\r\nhead of the traitor had been borne in the talons of the auspicious\r\nbird. Eagles hovered above the troops of Brutus and\r\nCassius as they took post at Philippi; and the same bird spoke\r\na note of fearful preparation to Lepidus, by thronging the temples\r\nof the Genius of Rome, and of Concord.\r\n\r\nIn Lloyd's \"Stratagems of Jerusalem,\" we read: \" Aristander,\r\nthe soothsayer, in the battel at Arbela, being the last\r\nagainst Darius, was then on horsebacke hard by Alexander,\r\napparelled all in white, and a crowne of golde upon his head,\r\nencouraging Alexander by the flight of an eagle, the victory\r\nshould be his own over Darius.

He regarded\r\nit as a fortunate omen, awoke the drowsy favourite of fate,\r\nand restored him to liberty, on the condition that when\r\nEmperor he would never make war upon the Vandals.\r\n\r\nThe Romans used to let an eagle fly from the funeral pile\r\nof a deceased emperor. Dryden alludes to this custom in his\r\nstanzas on Oliver Cromwell, after his funeral, when he says,\r\nofficious haste \"did let too soon the sacred eagle fly.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil mentions the oblative augury:\r\n\r\n\"Scarce had he said, when full before his sight\r\nTwo doves, descending from their airy flight,\r\nSecure upon the grassy plain alight--\r\n... [** spacing?] With watchful sight\r\nObserving still the motions of their flight,\r\nWhat course they took, what happy signs they show!\r\nThey fled, and, flutt'ring by degrees, withdrew.\"\r\n\r\nA flock of various kinds of birds flying about anyone was\r\nconsidered a good sign. The flight of vultures was carefully\r\nregarded, because of their rare appearance. Plutarch relates\r\nthat always before victories there appeared two vultures, and\r\naccompanied the army. They were known by their brazen\r\ncollars (for the soldiers, when they took them, put them about\r\ntheir necks, and so let them go, whereupon they in a manner\r\nknew and saluted the soldiers), and when these appeared in\r\ntheir marches, it was considered an omen of good success.\r\n\r\nThe same writer remarks that the Romans made a great use\r\nof the vulture in their auguries; they were not, however, consistent\r\nin their views respecting the auspiciousness of the\r\nvulture, for in the \"Thebaid\" of Statius, the prophet, taking\r\nan augury, complains that no propitious bird has come in view,\r\nbut that the hawk and vulture have alone been seen.\r\n\r\nVultures, says Aristotle, following an army, were made use\r\nof by Herodorus, the father of Bryson, as an argument, from\r\nthe suddenness of their appearance, that they came from another",

Dionysius relates\r\nthat the downfall of Tarquinius Superbus was preceded\r\nby the following prodigy: Some eagles built their nest at the\r\ntop of a tall palm-tree, near the king's palace. While the eagles\r\nwere still unfledged, a large flight of vultures attacked the nest,\r\nand destroyed it: killed the young birds, and assaulted the\r\nparent birds on their return to the nest, striking them with\r\ntheir beaks and wings, and drove them from the palm-tree.\r\n\r\nDio Cassius states that when Augustus, destined to high\r\nhonours, appeared at the Comitia, in the Campus Martius,\r\nfor his election as consul, he saw six vultures, and that he\r\nafterwards saw twelve, when he addressed the soldiers. He\r\nis said to have compared this augury with that of Romulus,\r\nand to have recognised in it an omen of his future greatness.\r\n\r\nThe buzzard had an ominous reputation, while the falcon\r\nhawk, \"Apollo's swift-winged messenger,\" was esteemed lucky\r\nto persons employed in affairs of marriage, or of money. Swallows\r\nflying about, or resting upon any place, brought ill-fortune.\r\nOwls foretold disaster, according to general belief; but at\r\nAthens they were reckoned omens of victory and success, from\r\nbeing sacred to Minerva, the protectrice of that city. Herons\r\nwere esteemed auspicious to those employed in any secret\r\ndesigns. The dove was a lucky bird. Ravens were much observed,\r\nfrom having the power of portending future events from\r\nApollo; but when they appeared about an army, they were\r\nsinister omens if they croaked on the left. Magpies chattering\r\nportended evil. The crowing of cocks was auspicious, and\r\npresaged the victory of Themistocles over the Persians; on\r\nthe contrary, if a hen was heard to crow, the Greeks thought\r\nthat some dreadful misfortune would happen. Bats were\r\nshunned; when any unlucky night-birds got into a house, the\r\nbad omen was suffered to be averted by catching them and\r\nhanging them before the door. Cicero quotes an instance\r\nwhere a B\u0153otian soothsayer promised victory to the Thebans\r\nfrom the crowing of a cock; and, according to Pliny, the same",

Rajah Brooke states: \"The Sing\u00e8\r\nDyacks, like the others, attend to the warning of birds of\r\nvarious sorts, some birds being in more repute than others.\"\r\n\r\nIN a curious book entitled \"The Magick of Kirani, King of\r\nPersia, and of Harpocratian\" (date 1685), there are some\r\nsingular superstitions with regard to birds, thus: \"A swallow,\r\nwhich, in the spring, raises all people by singing; and it has\r\nsuch actions as these: if anyone takes its young ones, and put\r\nthem in a pot, and when it is luted up, bake them; then, opening\r\nthe pot, if he considers, he will find two young ones kissing\r\none another; and two turning one from the other. If, therefore,\r\nyou take those two that kiss one another, and dissolve\r\nthem in oil of roses, or give the ashes in drink, it is a love\r\npotion; but you may dissolve this, if you give a little of the\r\nashes of those that turn one from another in oyntement or\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n\"If anyone cut out the tongue of a goose alive, and lay it\r\nupon the breast of a man or a woman asleep, they will confess\r\nall that ever they have done.\r\n\r\n\"For love between a man and his wife.

After a hawk has\r\nbeen ill, and is sufficiently recovered to pursue the game, the owner has\r\nthis admonition given to him: \"On the morrow tyde, when thou goest out\r\nto haukyng, say, In the name of the Lord, the birds of heaven shall be\r\nbeneath thy feet; also, if he be hurt by the heron, say, the Lion of the\r\ntribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered: Hallelujah; and if he\r\nbe bitte of any man, say, He that the wicked doth bind, the Lord at his\r\ncoming shall set free.\"",

If anyone, therefore, have got\r\nthis herb, he will do many things which are not now lawful to\r\nmention, as of the most divine nature, which man cannot perform.\r\nIf, therefore, any man engrave a woodpecker on the\r\nstone dentrites, and a sea-dragon under its feet, and enclose the\r\nherb underneath it which the woodpecker found and carried,\r\nevery gate will open to him, and gates and locks; savage\r\nbeasts will also obey him, and come to tameness; he shall also\r\nbe beloved and observed of all, and whatever he hath a mind\r\nto, he shall acquire and perform.

For, when there are\r\ngreat storms upon the coasts of Lybia Deserta, the sea casts up\r\ngreat tunnies on the shore, and these breed worms for fourteen\r\ndays, and grow to be as big as flies, then as locusts, which, being\r\naugmented in bigness, become birds called quails. For illusion:\r\ndissolve the eyes of a quail, or a sea-tench, with a little\r\nwater in a glass vessel for seven days, then add a little oil; put\r\na little of this in the candle, or only anoint a rag and light\r\namong the company, and they will look on themselves like\r\ndevils on fire, so that every one will run his way.",

Going\r\ninto a lapidary's shop to \"treat with the master for a stone to\r\nbe put upon my father's tomb; and casting my eyes up and\r\ndown, I might spie a huge marble with a large inscription upon't,\r\nwhich was thus, to my best remembrance: 'Here lies John\r\nOxenham, a goodly young man, in whose chamber, as he was\r\nstruggling with the pangs of death, a bird with a white breast\r\nwas seen fluttering about his bed and so vanish'd. Here lies,\r\nalso, Mary Oxenham, the sister of the said John, who died the\r\nnext day, and the same apparition was seen in the room. Here\r\nlies, hard by, James Oxenham, the son of the said John, who\r\ndyed a child in his cradle, a little after, and such a bird was\r\nseen fluttering about his head a little before he expir'd, which\r\nvanish'd afterwards.'\r\n\r\n\"At the bottom of the stone there is: 'Here lies Elizabeth\r\nOxenham, the mother of the said John, who died sixteen years\r\nsince, when such a bird with a white breast was seen about her\r\nbed before her death.'

  "p3590.png": "\r\nA Devonshire ballad relates how, on the bridal eve of Margaret,\r\nheiress of the brave and generous Sir James Oxenham, a\r\nsilver-breasted bird flew over the wedding-guests, just as Sir\r\nJames rose to acknowledge their congratulations. The next day\r\nthe bride fell dead at the altar, stabbed by a discarded lover:\r\n\r\n\"'Now, marry me, proud maid,' he cried,\r\n'Thy blood with mine shall wed!'\r\nHe dashed the dagger in his side,\r\nAnd at her feet fell dead.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Margaret, too, grows cold with death,\r\nAnd round her hovering flies\r\nThe phantom-bird, for her last breath,\r\nTo bear it to the skies.\"\r\n\r\nIn Fitz-Patrick's \"Life of Bishop Doyle,\" alluding to his\r\ndeath, we read: \"Considering that the season was midsummer,\r\nand not winter, the visit of two robin red-breasts to the sick-*room\r\nmay be noticed as interesting.

When he\r\nhad dressed himself that day to go to the House of Lords, he\r\nsaid he thought he did not look as if he was likely to Die. In\r\nthe evening of the following day, being Friday, he told the\r\neldest Miss Amphlett that she look'd melancholy; 'but,' said\r\nhe, 'you are foolish and fearful I have lived two Days, and\r\nGod willing, I will live out the third.' On the morning of\r\nSaturday he told the same Ladies that he was very well, and\r\nbelieved he should bilk the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"Some hours afterwards he went with them, Mr. Fortescue,\r\nand Captain Wolesley, to Pitt Place at Epsom, withdrew to his\r\nbedchamber soon after eleven o'clock at night, talked cheerfully\r\nto his Servant, and particularly enquired of him what care had\r\nbeen taken to provide good Rolls for his breakfast the next\r\nmorning; step'd into Bed with his Waistcoat on, and as his\r\nServant was pulling it off, put his hand to his side, sank back,\r\nand immediately expired without a Groan. He ate a good\r\ndinner after his arrival at Pitt Place that day, took an Egg for\r\nhis Supper, and did nothing at all out of order, except the\r\nwhile he was eating his Soup at Dinner he had a rising in his\r\nThroat, a thing which had often happened to him before, and\r\nwhich obliged him to spit some of it out. His Physician, Dr.\r\nFothergill, told me Lord Lyttelton had, in the Summer preceding,\r\na bad pain in his side; and he judg'd that some great vessel in\r\nthe part where he had felt the pain gave way, and to that he\r\nconjectured his Death was owing. His Declaration of his Dream\r\nand his Expressions above mentioned consequential thereunto,\r\nwere, upon a close inquiry, asserted to me to have been so by\r\nMrs. Flood, the eldest Miss Amphlett, Captain Wolseley[** typo?

In\r\n1828, Mr. Taylor, of Worcester Park, near Ewell, who was then\r\nabove eighty years of age, told me--then residing at Pit Place--that\r\nhe was in the neighbourhood during the year 1779, and\r\nheard particulars of the illness and death of Lord Lyttelton\r\nfrom an Italian Painter, visiting at Pit Place, at the time of\r\nLord Lyttelton's death. Lord Lyttelton had come to Pit Place\r\nin a very precarious state, and was ordered not to take any but\r\nthe gentlest exercise. Walking in the Conservatory with Lady\r\nAffleck and two Misses Affleck, a robin perched on an orange-tree\r\nclose to them. Lord L. attempted to catch it, but failing,\r\nand being laughed at by the ladies, said he would catch it if it\r\nwere the death of him, and succeeded, putting himself in a\r\ngreat heat by the exertion. He gave the bird to Lady Affleck,\r\nwho walked about with it in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Lyttelton became so ill and feverish that he went off\r\nto London for advice to a house in Bruton Street. In his\r\ndelirium he imagined that a Lady with a Bird in her hand,\r\ndrawing his curtain, told him he would die. Dreams being\r\nthe Galamatia of waking thoughts, it needed no ghost to fix\r\nsuch an impression on the mind of a sick man; and this may\r\nbe said to clear away supernatural agency thus far.

This bust was carved from a picture of Sir Anthony\r\nVandyke's drawing; the sculptor found great fault with the forehead\r\nas most unfortunate. There was a seam in the middle of\r\nhis forehead (downwards) which is a very ill sign in Metoposcopie.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident connected with the sad fate of the late Mr.\r\nHerbert Ingram, founder of the Illustrated London News, is\r\nthus related in the Lincoln Herald (September 14, 1860). The\r\naccount is headed \"An ominous bird at Boston.\" \"The market-*place\r\nand several other portions of the town commanding a\r\nview of the lofty tower of old St. Botolph, Boston, was studded\r\nfor hours on Sunday last, the 9th instant, with people anxiously\r\ngazing at a large and strange-looking bird seated high on the\r\nsteeple. Though seen for the first time by the mass of people\r\non the day just named, we are informed that it settled on the\r\ntower on Saturday afternoon, and remained an hour or two,\r\nand then flew away, returning again some time during the night.\r\nIt left its position again for about two hours on Sunday afternoon\r\n(in quest of food, no doubt), and returned in the evening.\r\nOn Monday morning Mr. Hackford, the custodian, or door-*",
  "p3630.png": "*keeper of the church, rose between five and six o'clock, and\r\nfinding it still seated on a corbel of the tower, he loaded a gun\r\nand shot it. It was found to be a cormorant, and measured\r\nfour feet six inches from tip to tip of the wings. Several of this\r\nkind of birds have been seen about the Scalp and lower down\r\nthe river, and, according to Thompson's 'History of Boston,'\r\nthey were formerly very plentiful about the Herring Hill off\r\nFreiston. Some thirty or forty years ago there were two took\r\nup their residence for a whole winter in the tower. In Leviticus\r\nthis bird is classed among the 'unclean,' and also in Isaiah,\r\nand again in Zephaniah ii. 14, it is named; but in both these\r\ncases it is in connection with desolation and departed glory.\r\nAnyone, therefore, who is disposed to be superstitious, might\r\nregard this settlement upon the church tower as decidedly\r\nominous.\"\r\n\r\nAdverting to this, Dr. Charles Mackay observes that the\r\nsuperstitious people in Boston considered the perching of the\r\nbird on their beautiful church tower as clearly significant of\r\nsome approaching calamity to the town, and the superstitious\r\nfeeling was largely increased, and in many cases ineradicably\r\nconfirmed, when it was announced in the London papers of\r\nabout a fortnight afterwards, that on the very morning when\r\nthe bird was first seen, Mr. Ingram and his young son had\r\nboth perished with about three hundred passengers in America,\r\nby the collision of the Lady Elgin, in which he had embarked,\r\nwith a schooner called the Augusta.\r\n\r\nIN the chapter on \"The Sea and Seamen,\" I have alluded to\r\nthe good or evil portents derived from some birds by\r\nsailors. Landsmen share in an equally credulous manner the\r\nsuperstitions of presaging birds.\r\n\r\nRavens, as well as swallows, prognosticated death. In\r\nLloyd's \"Stratagems of Jerusalem\" (1602) he says: \"By swallows\r\nlighting upon Pirrhus' tents, and lighting upon the mast\r\nof Mar. Antonius' ship, sayling after Cleopatra to Egypt, the\r\nsoothsayers did prognosticate that Pirrhus should be slaine at",

At harvest, after offering their sacrifices, and\r\nfeasting in the open air, they left the remains of their repast to\r\nattract the bird (supposed to have been a crow or raven), and\r\nthe young men set up a shout in imitation of its cry. If the\r\nbird did not eat of the meal offered to it, or if it afterwards remained\r\nhovering in the air, perched quietly on a tree, or in its\r\nflight took a course opposite to that which the men wished to\r\npursue, their departure was deferred and their prayers and\r\nsacrifices renewed.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Transactions of the Batavian Society\" (vol. vii.), we\r\nread that the D\u00e1yas of Borneo still hold particular kinds of birds\r\nin great veneration, and draw omens from their flight, and the\r\nsounds which they utter. One of the principal of these is a\r\nwhite-headed kite, which preys on fish, snakes, and vermin.\r\nBefore the D\u00e1yas enter on a journey, or engage in any war, or\r\nindeed any matter of importance, they endeavour to procure\r\nomens from these kites, and for this purpose invite their approach\r\nby screaming songs, and scattering rice before them. If\r\nthese birds take flight in the direction they wish to go, it is\r\nregarded as a favourable omen: but if they take another direction,\r\nthe business is delayed until the omens are more suitable.\r\n\r\nThere is an odd superstition connected with the crossbill, in\r\nThuringia, which makes the woodcutters very careful of their\r\nnests.

Stories of disembodied souls (remarks Mr. Kelly)\r\nappearing as doves, are numerous; but lend only an ambiguous\r\nsupport to Kuhn's conjecture, since we cannot tell whether or\r\nnot their origin is due in part, or wholly, to biblical and\r\necclesiastical ideas.

But I seek the favour of God and His\r\napostle; and I have heard from one of the companions of\r\nthe Prophet that the spirits of the martyrs will be lodged in\r\nthe crops of green birds who shall taste the fruits and drink of the\r\nrivers of Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThe legend of St. Brendan, an Irish saint (died 577), states\r\nthat he made a voyage of discovery in search of an island supposed\r\nto contain the identical paradise of Adam and Eve. On\r\nhis way he saw a fair land full of flowers, herbs, and trees, and\r\nlanded there. \"And when they had gone some distance they\r\nfound a well, and thereby stood a tree full of boughs, and on\r\nevery bough sat a bird; and they sat so thick on the tree, that\r\nnot a leaf could be seen, the number of them was so great, and\r\nthey sang so merrily, it was a heavenly noise to hear. And then\r\nanon, one of the birds flew from the tree to St. Brendan, and\r\nwith flickering of its wings, made a full merry noise like a fiddle,\r\na joyful melody. And then St. Brendan commanded the bird\r\nto tell him why they sat so thick on the tree, and sang so\r\nmerrily. And then the bird said: 'Sometime we were angels\r\nin heaven, but when our master Lucifer fell for his high pride,\r\nwe fell for our offences, some hither, and some lower, after the\r\nnature of their trespass; and because our trespass is but little,\r\ntherefore our Lord hath set us here, out of all pain, to serve\r\nHim on this tree in the best manner that we can.'",
  "p3750.png": "\r\n\"The bird, moreover, said to the saint: 'It is twelve months\r\npast that ye departed from your abbey, and in the seventh year\r\nhereafter ye shall see the place that ye desire to come unto:\r\nand all these seven years ye shall keep your Easter here with us\r\nevery year, and at the end of the seventh year ye shall come to\r\nthe land of behest.' And this was on Easter Day that the bird\r\nsaid these words to St. Brendan. And then all the birds began\r\nto sing evensong so merrily, that it was a heavenly noise to hear;\r\nand after supper St. Brendan and his fellows went to bed and\r\nslept well, and on the morrow rose betimes, and then these\r\nbirds began matins, prime, and hours, and all such service as\r\nChristian men used to sing.\"\r\n\r\nA troop of doves seek a sister soul which is about to leave\r\nthe earth. In the \"Vie de Ste. Elizabeth,'[** \"] by Count Montalembert,\r\nwe read that \"Duke Louis of Thuringia, the husband of\r\nSt. Elizabeth of Hungary, being on the point of expiring, said\r\nto those around him: 'Do you see those doves more white\r\nthan snow?' His attendants supposed him to be a prey to\r\nvisions, but a little while afterwards he said to them: 'I must\r\nfly away with those brilliant doves.' Having said this, he fell\r\nasleep in peace. Then his almoner, Berthold, perceived doves\r\nflying away to the east, and followed them a long time with his\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the legend of St. Polycarp, who was burned alive, his\r\nblood extinguished the flames, and from his ashes arose a white\r\ndove which flew towards heaven. In the same manner, a dove\r\nwas seen issuing from the funeral pyre of Joan of Arc.\r\n\r\nIn the Breton ballad of \"Lord Nann and the Korrigan\"\r\nthere is an allusion to the spirit-bearing doves:\r\n\r\n\"It was a marvel to see, men say,\r\nThe night that followed the day,\r\nThe lady in earth by her lord lay.\r\n\r\n\"To see two oak-trees themselves rear\r\nFrom the new-made grave into the air;\r\n\r\n\"And on their branches two doves white,\r\nWho there were hopping gay and light;\r\n\r\n\"Which sang when rose the morning ray,\r\nAnd then toward heaven sped away.\"",

In the ceremony of\r\ncanonisation the pope is offered, among other presents, caged\r\nbirds as emblematical of the virtues of saints.\r\n\r\nMr. Slack, in his \"Notes of Travel\" (1860), in describing\r\nwhat he saw on the liquefaction of the blood of St. Gennaro, at\r\nNaples, observes that, \"Strange to say, a number of birds were\r\nlet loose, which the spectators had brought with them for the\r\npurpose.\" This, he afterwards learned, was the custom at all\r\nthe great festivals of the Church, and symbolises the soul's joy\r\nwhen delivered from the sins and sorrows of earth. It is a\r\nliteral rendering of that passage in the Psalms: \"My soul is\r\nescaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowler. The snare is\r\nbroken, and we are delivered.\"\r\n\r\nAs a parallel to the German reason for the owl flying in\r\nsolitude by night (namely, that when set to watch the wren imprisoned\r\nin a mouse-hole, he fell asleep, and was so ashamed at\r\nletting him thus escape that he has never since dared show himself\r\nby day), is the story of the rude Ahts, made to account for\r\nthe melancholy note of the loon, as it is heard flying about\r\nthe wild lakes of Vancouver's Island. As a good instance of\r\nthe resemblance in construction of plot often found in very\r\ndistant regions, let us place side by side with it a story of the\r\nBasutos in the south of Africa:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Aht story, two fishermen went one day in\r\ntwo canoes to catch halibut. But while one of them caught\r\nmany, the other caught none. So the latter, angered by the\r\ntaunts of his more fortunate, but physically weaker companion,\r\nbethought himself how he might take all his fish from him by\r\nforce, and cause him to return home fishless and ashamed.\r\nThen, whilst his friend was pulling up a fish, he knocked him",
  "p3770.png": "on the head with a wooden club he used for killing halibut,\r\nand to prevent the tale ever being told, cut out his companion's\r\ntongue, and took the fish home to his own wife. When the\r\ntongueless man arrived at the village, and his friends came to\r\ninquire of his sport, he could only answer by a noise resembling\r\nthe note of the loon. The great spirit Quawteaht was so\r\nangry at all this, that he changed the injured Indian into a loon,\r\nand the other into a crow, and the loon's plaintive cry now is\r\nthe voice of the fisherman trying to make himself understood.\r\n\r\nThe Basuto legend states that two brothers having gone in\r\ndifferent directions to make their fortunes, met again, after\r\nsundry adventures, the elder enriched by a pack of dogs, the\r\nyounger by a large number of cows. The younger offered his\r\nbrother as many of these cows as he pleased, with the exception\r\nof a certain white one. This he would not part with, so\r\nas they went home, and the younger brother was drinking at a\r\npool, Macilo, the elder, seized his brother's head, and held it\r\nunder the water until he was dead. Then he buried the body,\r\nand covered it with a stone, and proceeded to drive back the\r\nwhole flock as his own. He had not, however, gone far, before\r\na small bird perched itself on the horn of the white cow, and\r\nexclaimed: \"Macilo has killed Maciloiane for the sake of the\r\nwhite cow he coveted.\" Twice did he kill the bird with a\r\nstone, but each time it reappeared, and uttered the same words.\r\nSo the third time he killed it, he burnt it, and threw its ashes\r\nto the winds. Then proudly he entered the village, and when\r\nthey all inquired for his brother, he said that they had taken\r\ndifferent roads, and that he was ignorant where he was. The\r\nwhite cow was greatly admired, but suddenly a small bird\r\nperched itself on its horns and exclaimed: \"Macilo has killed\r\nMaciloiane for the sake of the white cow he coveted.\" Thus,\r\nthrough a bird into which the heart of a murdered man had\r\nbeen transformed, did the truth become known, and everyone\r\ndeparted from the presence of the murderer.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewa Indians give an explanation of the robin's\r\nfriendliness to man. There was once a hunter so ambitious",

But next\r\nday, when the father entered the hut, his son had paid the\r\npenalty of violated nature, and in the form of a robin had just\r\nflown down to the top of a lodge. There, before he flew away\r\nto the woods, he entreated his father not to mourn the transformation.\r\n\"I shall be happier,\" he said, \"in my present state\r\nthan I could have been as a man. I shall always be the friend\r\nof men and keep near their dwellings; I could not gratify your\r\npride as a warrior, but I will cheer you with my songs....\r\nI am now free from cares and pains, my food is furnished by\r\nthe fields and mountains, and my path is in the bright air.\"\r\n\r\nA common belief among the Russian peasantry is that the\r\nspirits of the departed haunt their old homes for the space of\r\nsix weeks, during which they eat and drink, and watch the\r\nsorrowing of the mourners. After a time they fly away to the\r\nother world. In certain districts bread-crumbs are placed in a\r\npiece of white linen at a window during these six weeks, and\r\nthe soul is believed to come and feed upon them in the shape\r\nof a bird. It is generally into pigeons or crows that the dead\r\nare transformed. Thus, when the Deacon Theodore and his\r\nthree schismatic brethren were burnt in 1681, the souls of the\r\nmartyrs, as the \"Old Believers\" affirm, appeared in the air as\r\npigeons.\r\n\r\nIn Volhymnia dead children are supposed to come back in\r\nthe spring to their native village, in the semblance of swallows\r\nand other small birds, and to seek by soft twittering, or song,\r\nto console their sorrowing parents.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo, also, according to Sclavonic superstitions, is\r\nintimately connected with the dead. In Little Russia she flies\r\nto watch over corpses. The Servians and Lithuanians look on\r\nher as a sister whom nothing can console for the loss of a\r\nbrother; and in a Russian marriage-song the orphan bride implores\r\nthe cuckoo to fetch her dead parents from the other",

When\r\nthe Pakoko tribe went on a murdering expedition this blackbird\r\nwas supposed, if propitious, to lead the way by a ball of\r\nfire lighting up the path of the warriors. These pretty birds were\r\nregarded as suitable food for the dead, i.e. for dwellers in the\r\n\"po\" (darkness), on account of their blackness. The same\r\nauthor observes that birds are regarded by the islanders of the\r\nSouth Pacific as special messengers of the gods, to warn individuals\r\nof impending danger. Each tribe had its own feathered\r\nguardian. These are alluded to in a \"Day Song for Maaki's\r\nF\u00eate,\" by Tangataroa (1820):\r\n\r\nChorus.  \"Like the outstretched heavens\r\nAre the spread wings of the warning bird,\r\n'Tis the incarnation of a god.\r\nOne shakes with terror\r\nAt the long curved bill.\r\n\r\nSolo.

After relating various ceremonies performed outside\r\nthe tent near by, the parties present formed a circle round\r\nthe dying woman. A man, who appeared to be the chief of\r\nthe tribe, entered inside the circle, holding a bird in his hand,\r\nwhich he placed near the mouth of the young woman. After\r\nabout a quarter of an hour the gipsy cried out and expired.\r\nHer companions carried back the body into the tent, and let\r\nloose the bird.\r\n\r\nAccording to the bystanders at this curious ceremony, it was\r\nwith the view of introducing the soul of the young woman into\r\nthe bird.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the perpetuation of a superstition, I quote\r\nfrom an article in the Paris journal Le Pays (June 27, 1879),\r\nan incident related by M. Paul de Cassagnac as occurring at\r\nthe funeral service for the late Prince Imperial at St. Augustine's:\r\n\"A curious detail one bearing the impress of a gentle\r\nsymbolism, should be noted; the enormous crowd which had\r\nbeen unable to find room in the church suddenly became\r\naware, just as the Benediction was pronounced, that a white\r\npigeon was fluttering undismayed overhead, and perched on\r\nthe stone eagle that surmounts the buildings. May not the\r\nAlmighty, to whom all things are possible, have, as a last reward,\r\npermitted him, who is no more, to behold under that graceful form\r\nwhat was going on, and to see how much he was loved? It is\r\nthe poetry of death; and our religion, which teaches us to\r\nbelieve in angels and revere them, does not hinder us from\r\nexperiencing that brief emotion which caused a thrill to run\r\nthrough the superstitious ranks of the crowd. Moreover, no\r\nparty can have the presumption to obtain a hold over the\r\nmasses without poetry, without a legend, without something",
  "p3810.png": "that appeals to the imagination and to the heart. It is a legend\r\nthat begets power.\"\r\n\r\nIN Ecclesiastes (chap. x. 20) we have a striking allusion\r\nto the peculiar intelligence of birds: \"Curse not the king,\r\nno, not in thy thought ... for a bird of the air shall carry the\r\nvoice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.\" By\r\nmeans of the lapwing, Solomon is said to have discovered the\r\nmost important secrets, and to have acted on them. This bird\r\nis regarded with particular reverence by the Indo-Mohammedans.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian writers say that this bird (called Huddud) was\r\nsent by the Queen of Sheba, or Saba, to King Solomon, on\r\nvarious occasions, and that it was the messenger of their\r\namours. It is added, that Solomon having been secretly informed\r\nby the winged confidant that the queen intended to\r\nhonour him with a grand embassy, enclosed a spacious square\r\nwith a wall of gold and silver bricks, within which he ranged\r\nhis numerous troops and attendants, in order to receive the\r\nambassadors, who were astonished at the suddenness of these\r\nsplendid and unexpected preparations. \"Solomon was David's\r\nheir, and he said: 'O men! we have been taught the speech\r\nof birds, and have had all things bestowed on us; this is\r\nmanifest excellence.' And his armies were gathered together\r\nto Solomon, consisting of genii, and men, and birds; and they\r\nwere led in distant lands, until they came to the valley of ants.\r\nAn ant said: 'O ants! enter ye into your habitations, lest\r\nSolomon and his army tread you underfoot, and perceive it\r\nnot.' And he smiled, laughing at her word, and said: 'O\r\nLord, excite me that I may be thankful for thy favour, wherewith\r\nthou hast favoured me and my parents; and that I may\r\ndo that which is right and well-pleasing to Thee; and introduce\r\nme, through Thy mercy, among Thy servants the righteous.'\r\nAnd he viewed the birds, and said: 'What is the reason that\r\nI see not the lapwing? Is she absent? Verily I will chastise\r\nher with a severe chastisement, or I will put her to death,",
  "p3820.png": "unless she bring me a just excuse.' And she tarried not long,\r\nand said: 'I have viewed that which thou hast not viewed;\r\nand I come to thee from Saba, with a certain piece of news. I\r\nfound a woman to reign over them, who is provided with everything\r\nand hath a magnificent throne. I found her and her\r\npeople to worship the sun, besides God; and Satan hath prepared\r\ntheir works for them, and hath turned them aside from\r\nthe way (wherefore they are not directed), lest they should\r\nworship God, who bringeth to light that which is hidden in\r\nheaven and earth, and knowing whatever they conceal, and\r\nwhatever they discover. God! there is no God but He; the\r\nLord of the magnificent throne.' He said: 'We shall see if\r\nthou hast spoken truth, or whether thou art a liar. Go with\r\nthis my letter, and cast it down to them; then turn aside from\r\nthem, and wait for an answer.'\" (Koran.)\r\n\r\nA legend runs: That the lapwing was once a princess, who,\r\nhearing of the return of a favourite brother long absent, in her\r\nanxiety to meet him with some refreshment, snatched up a pot\r\nof hot milk from the fire, and placing it on her head, hurried\r\nout in the direction in which he was falsely said to be coming,\r\nheedless of the burn caused by the heated vessel. Unavailing\r\nfor years she sought for this brother, calling out, \"Brother, O\r\nbrother!\" until Allah, moved by compassion, gave her wings,\r\nand changed her into a lapwing, the better to accomplish her\r\npurpose; hence this bird is so often seen wheeling round in\r\nlong flights, as if in quest of some one, uttering a melancholy\r\ncry resembling, \"Brother, O brother!\" The Mohammedan\r\nwomen call the lapwing \"The sister of the brother,\" and when\r\nthey hear its cry in the evening, run from their houses and\r\nthrow water in the air, that the bird may use it to assuage the\r\npain of the burn on the top of its head, still marked by some\r\nblack feathers.\r\n\r\nMohammed is said to have derived oracular information from\r\na pigeon, which he had taught, as the representative of the\r\nangel Gabriel, to appear to whisper in his ear.[*] A favourite\r\n\r\n* Sale, in his preliminary discourse to the translation of the Koran\r\n(section ii.), says: \"After Mohammed (in his flight) and his companions",

The saint saw a number of birds in a\r\nfield by the wayside, when suddenly those which were on the\r\ntrees came round him, and listened with great attention to his\r\nwords. The legend adds that after the sermon, \"all the birds\r\nbegan to open their beaks, to stretch their necks, to flap their\r\nwings, to bow their heads to the ground, and by their motions\r\nand songs, endeavoured to manifest their joy to the saint, who\r\nrejoiced with them, and was charmed with their beautiful variety,\r\ntheir attention, and familiarity.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Francis had a great tenderness for larks, and often pointed\r\nout to his disciples the bird mounting to \"heaven's gate,\" and\r\nsinging praises to the Creator, as a proper emblem of Christian\r\naspiration.[*]\r\n\r\nA lark brought her brood of nestlings to his cell, to be fed\r\nfrom his hand; he saw that the strongest of these nestlings\r\ntyrannised over the others, pecking at them, and taking more\r\nthan his due share of the food, whereupon the good saint\r\n\r\nwere got into the cave, two pigeons laid their eggs at the entrance, and a\r\nspider covered the mouth of the cave with her web, which made the pursuers\r\nlook no further.\"\r\n\r\nAndrew Boorde, in his \"Introduction of Knowledge,\" has: \"Macomyt,\r\na false fellow, made it (the Alcoran); he sedused the people vnder thys\r\nmaner: he dyd bryng vp a doue, and would put two or thre pesen in his\r\neare, & she would every day come to his eare and eate the peason, and then\r\nthe people would thynke the holy Goost, or an Angell, did come & teache\r\nhym what the people should do.\"\r\n\r\n* In Russia, on March 9th, the day on which the larks are supposed to\r\narrive, the rustics make clay images of those birds, smear them with honey,\r\nand tip their heads with tinsel, and then carry them about, singing songs\r\nto spring, or to Lada, the vernal goddess of love and fidelity.",

But\r\nthe warbling of the birds interrupted them, therefore St. Francis\r\nsaid to them, \"Be silent until we have also praised God;\" and\r\nthey ceased their song till he had given them permission. On\r\nanother occasion, preaching at Alviano, he could not make\r\nhimself heard for the chirping of the swallows, which were at\r\nthat time building their nests. Pausing, therefore, in his sermon,\r\nhe said, \"My sisters, you have talked enough; it is time\r\nthat I should have my turn. Be silent, and listen to the word\r\nof God!\" and they were silent immediately.\r\n\r\nAristophanes, the celebrated comic poet of Athens, describes\r\nthe birds as pursuing occupations similar to human labourers:\r\n\r\n\"Messenger.

She replied, 'That you are grossly insulting\r\nyour husband.' 'Then,' said the lady, 'kill that cock without\r\ndelay.' They did so, but soon after the second cock crew, and\r\nthe lady repeated her question. 'Madam,' said the handmaid,\r\n'he says, \"My companion died for revealing the truth, and\r\nfor the same cause I am prepared to die.\"' 'Kill him,' cried\r\nthe lady, which they did.

And her orders were obeyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of this story is thus stated: \"My beloved,\r\nthe emperor is God; the soldier, Christ; and the wife, the\r\nsoul. The gallant is the devil. The handmaid is conscience.\r\nThe first cock is our Saviour, who was put to death; the second\r\nis the martyrs; and the third is a preacher, who ought to be\r\nearnest in declaring the truth, but, being deterred by menaces,\r\nis afraid to utter it.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Mandeville, in his account of the Emperor Prester\r\nJohn (1322), mentions some parrots in the country, \"which\r\nspeak of their own nature, and salute men that go through the\r\ndeserts, and speak to him as plainly as though it were a man.\r\nAnd they that speak will have a large tongue, and have five\r\ntoes on each foot.\"\r\n\r\nBruce, the African traveller, tells us that in 1621 there was\r\nbrought into Abyssinia a bird called Para, which was about the",
  "p3870.png": "bigness of a hen, and spoke all languages, Indian, Portuguese,\r\nand Arabic. It named the king's name, and although its voice\r\nwas that of a man, it could likewise neigh like a horse, and\r\nmew like a cat, but did not sing like a bird. It was produced\r\nbefore the assembly of judges, of the priests and the azages of\r\ncourt, and there it spoke with great gravity. The assembly,\r\nafter considering circumstances well, were unanimously of\r\nopinion that the evil spirit had no part in endowing it with\r\nthese talents. But to be certain of this, it was thought most\r\nprudent to take the advice of Res Selas Christos, then in\r\nGojam, but he died on the road.\r\n\r\nVaillant, the French traveller, alluding to the Cape of Good\r\nHope, gives a curious instance of the superstitious character of\r\nthe Hottentots, One of the natives, of the name of Pil, who\r\nwas accompanying him to the Cape, brought to him a hen-bird\r\nof the Touracos breed. He ordered him immediately to return\r\nto the spot where he had killed it, not doubting that he would\r\nmeet with the cock-bird. The Hottentot begged he would\r\nexcuse him, not daring, he said, to fire at it. Vaillant, in insisting\r\nthat his order should be obeyed, was astonished to see\r\nthe countenance of the poor fellow assume a melancholy and\r\ndejected air. \"Alas,\" exclaimed the Hottentot, \"I am certain\r\nthat some cruel misfortune will befall me, for I had no sooner\r\nshot the hen than the cock flew after me, repeating several\r\ntimes, 'Pil me frow.'\" This is the usual cry of the bird, but\r\nthe syllable it had pronounced, and which had so much alarmed\r\nthe Hottentot, are three Dutch words, signifying Pil, or Peter\r\nmy wife. He therefore thought that the bird called him by\r\nhis name, and demanded his unfortunate partner.\r\n\r\nAMONG the curiosities of ancient credulity was the belief\r\nthat certain birds possessed stones of remarkable talismanic\r\nvirtues. One of these was supposed to be found in the\r\nbrain of a vulture, and gave health to the finder, and successful\r\nresults when soliciting favours. Dioscorides gives a singular\r\nstory of the use of the eagle-stone in detecting larceny. All the",
  "p3880.png": "suspected persons being called together, flour was kneaded up\r\nin their presence, sprinkled with the powder of the stone; a\r\ncertain incantation was to be repeated at the same time. The\r\npaste was then rounded into balls, as large as eggs, and then\r\ngiven to each with a little drink. The guilty person found it\r\nimpossible to swallow a mouthful, and was choked in the attempt.\r\nIt is curious that the Hindoos still employ a similar\r\nordeal, in which rice is the test. The guilty conscience has,\r\nno doubt, more to do with this miracle than the bolus itself.\r\n\r\nThe eagle-stone, which is described as of a scarlet colour,\r\nrendered its owner amiable, sober, and rich, and preserved\r\nhim from adverse casualties. It was also regarded as a talisman\r\nof great virtue in cases of pregnancy. In the curious catalogue\r\nof Dr. Bargrave's Museum (bequeathed to Christchurch, Canterbury,\r\nin 1676), printed by the Camden Society, mention is\r\nmade of an eagle-stone, bought of an Armenian at Rome. \"It\r\nis so useful,\" says Dean Bargrave, \"that my wife can seldom\r\nkeep it at home, and therefore she hath sewed the strings to\r\nthe knitt purse in which the stone is, for the convenience of\r\nthe tying of it to the patient on occasion, and hath a box to\r\nput the purse and stone in. It were fitt that either the Dean's\r\n(Canterbury) or vice-dean's wife (if they be marryed men) should\r\nhave this stone in their custody for the public good, as to\r\nneighbourhood; but still, that they have a great care into\r\nwhose hand it be committed, and that the midwives have a\r\ncare of it, so that it shall be the Cathedral's stone.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Mercurius Rusticus,\" we read that the rebels stole\r\nfrom a house \"a cock-eagle's stone, for which thirty pieces had\r\nbeen offered by a physician.\"\r\n\r\nCorvia was the name of a stone obtained from the nest of a\r\ncrow. Leonardus Camillus, in his \"Mirror of Stones,\" explains\r\nthe manner of obtaining this precious object: \"On the\r\ncalends of April, boil the eggs taken out of a crow's nest, until\r\nthey are hard, and being cold let them be placed in the nest as\r\nthey were before. When the crow knows this, she flies a long\r\nway to find the stone, and returns with it to her nest, and the",
  "p3890.png": "eggs being touched with it, they become fresh and prolific.\r\nThe stone must be immediately snatched out of the nest. Its\r\nvirtue is to increase riches, to bestow honours, and foretell\r\nfuture events.\"\r\n\r\nThe Alectorius, a stone worn by the wrestler Milo, was so\r\ncalled from being taken out of the gizzard of a fowl. A stone\r\nlike a crystal, as large as a bean, extracted from a cock, was considered\r\nby the Romans to render the wearer invisible. In the\r\nmiddle ages, for this fiction was substituted another, that the\r\nowner of the stone would never feel thirsty, and the proper\r\ncock that had the stone was to be discovered by never drinking,\r\nwhile eating, like other fowls!\r\n\r\nThe \"calorites,\" said to be taken out of the bird silla, was\r\nof a green colour, like juice pressed out of an herb. If bound\r\nwith iron, it was esteemed a powerful auxiliary in magical art.\r\n\r\nA raven-stone conferred invisibility; a talisman which was\r\nprocured in New Pomerania, in the following manner: When\r\nyou have discovered a raven's nest, you must climb the tree,\r\nand take your chance that the parent-birds are, at least, a hundred\r\nyears old, for otherwise you will have your trouble for\r\nnothing. You are then to kill one of the nestlings, which must\r\nbe a male bird, and not more than six weeks old. Then you\r\nmay descend the tree, but be very careful to mark well the spot\r\nwhere it stands, for by-and-by it will become invisible, as soon\r\nas the raven comes back, and lays a raven-stone in the throat\r\nof its dead nestling. When it does this, you may go up again\r\nand secure the stone.\r\n\r\nA Rabbinical myth states that Solomon went to his fountain,\r\nwhere he found the demon Sackar, whom he captured by a\r\nruse and chained down. Solomon pressed his ring to the\r\nchain, and Sackar uttered a cry so shrill that the earth quaked.\r\n\r\nQuoth Solomon, \"Fear not, I shall restore you to liberty if you\r\nwill tell me how to burrow noiselessly after minerals and metals.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not how to do so,\" answered the Jin; \"but the raven\r\ncan tell you: place over her eggs a sheet of crystal, and you\r\nshall see how the mother will break it.\"",
  "p3900.png": "\r\nSolomon did so, and the mother brought a stone and shattered\r\nthe crystal.\r\n\r\n\"Whence got you that stone?\" asked Solomon.\r\n\r\n\"It is the stone samur,\" answered the raven; \"it comes\r\nfrom a desert in the uttermost East.\" So the monarch sent\r\nsome giants to follow the raven, and bring him a suitable\r\nnumber of stones.\r\n\r\nA stone from the hoopoo, when laid upon the breast of a\r\nsleeping person, forced him to discover his rogueries. The\r\npretty little swallow was, in former times, a greater conjuror\r\nthan it is considered at present, having two precious stones in\r\nthe stomach; a red one for curing insanity, and a black one\r\nensuring good luck. The swallow-stone was a Norman superstition,\r\naccording to which the bird knows how to find on the\r\nsea-shore a stone that restored sight to the blind. Longfellow,\r\nin \"Evangeline,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow\r\nBrings from the shore of the sea, to restore the sight of her fledglings.\"\r\n\r\nTHE eagle, \"Jove's imperial bird,\" claims the sovereignty\r\nof the feathered tribes, and was said by Pliny and others\r\nto possess the art of rejuvenation. An old writer describes\r\nthis process. In age, the bird \"hathe darknesse and dimness\r\nin eien, and hevinesse in wings, and against this disadvantage\r\nshe is taught by kinde to seeke a well of springing water, and\r\nthen she flyeth up into the aire as farre as she may, till she be\r\nfull hot by heat of the aire, and by travaile of flight, and so\r\nthen by heat the pores be opened, and the feathers chafed, and\r\nshe falleth sideinglye into the well and there the feathers be\r\nchaunged and the dimnesse of her eien is wiped away and\r\npurged, and she taketh againe her might and strength.\"\r\n\r\nSpenser in the \"Faerie Queene,\" alludes to this superstition:\r\n\r\n\"She saw where he upstarted brave\r\nOut of the well.....\r\nAs eagle fresh out of the ocean wave\r\nWhere he hath left his plumes, all hoary gray,\r\nAnd decks himself with feathers, youthful, gay.\"",

Now,\r\nif she see any of them to wink, or their eyes to water at the\r\nrays of the sun, she turns it with the head forward out of the\r\nnest, as a bastard, and not right, none of hers; but brings up\r\nand nourisheth that, whose eye will abide the light of the sun,\r\nas she looketh directly upon him.\"[*]\r\n\r\nThe earliest authority for the legend which gave rise to the\r\nStanley crest (an eagle's leg, erased or, with the motto, Sans\r\nchanger ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9), is a metrical poem written by Thomas\r\nStanley, Bishop of Man 1510-70, two centuries after the supposed\r\nincident. He states that Lord Latham, dwelling at\r\nLatham Hall, was a man of fourscore years of age, and his lady\r\nas old, and that being without hope of a family, heaven did\r\nsend them an heir most miraculously. For an eagle had her\r\nnest in Tarlestowe Wood, in which were three fair birds ready\r\nto fly; and one day she brought to them a goodly boy, \"swaddled\r\nand clad in a mantle of red,\" the news of which reaching\r\nLord Latham, he rode with all speed to the wood, and found\r\nthe babe preserved by God's grace, and causing it to be fetched\r\ndown, he brought it to his lady at Latham, where they took it\r\nas their own, and \"thanked God for all.\" The child was ap-*\r\n\r\n* The ancient myth about the ostrich was that she never hatches her\r\neggs by sitting upon them, but by the rays of light and warmth from her\r\neyes.

They had it baptised, therefore, by the name of\r\nOskell, and made it their heir after them. \"From whence the\r\nchild came,\" saith the bishop, \"the truth no woman can show,\r\nneither where nor what place it was fetched from; but the\r\nfoundling grew to manhood, and became the father of Isabella\r\nLatham, with whom Sir John Stanley fell in love, and in a short\r\ntime stole her away. Sir Oskell was a good man and tender\r\nfather; he forgave the young people, and having honourably\r\nlived, he godly made his end, leaving his property to Sir John\r\nStanley and the fair Isabella.\"\r\n\r\nThis badge was conspicuous at Flodden Field, when, says\r\nthe ballad, King James of Scotland\r\n\r\n\"Was prostrate\r\nBy the helpe of th' eagle with her swaddled chylde.\"\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Scottish army was mainly attributed to\r\nSir Edward Stanley, who commanded the rearguard of the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nACCORDING to tradition, King Arthur is said to have\r\nbeen changed into a RAVEN. In Jarvis's translation of\r\n\"Don Quixote\" (book ii. c. 5), the following passage occurs:\r\n\"Have you not read, sir,\" answered Don Quixote, \"the annals\r\nand histories of England, wherein are recorded the famous exploits\r\nof King Arthur, whom in our Castilian tongue we always\r\ncall King Artus; of whom there goes an old tradition, and a\r\ncommon one all over the kingdom of Great Britain, that this\r\nking did not die, but that, by magic art, he was turned into a\r\nraven; and that in process of time, he shall reign again and\r\nrecover his kingdom and sceptre, for which reason it cannot be\r\nproved that, from that time to this, any Englishman has killed\r\na raven.\"\r\n\r\nOn this subject, Mr. Edgar MacCulloch, in \"Notes and\r\nQueries,\" states: \"My reason for transcribing this passage is\r\nto record the curious fact that the legend of King Arthur's existence\r\nin the form of a raven was still repeated as a piece of",
  "p3930.png": "folk-lore in Cornwall about sixty years ago. My father, who\r\ndied about two years since, at the age of eighty, spent a few\r\nyears of his youth in the neighbourhood of Penzance. One\r\nday he was walking along Marazion Green, with his fowling-piece\r\non his shoulder, when he saw a raven at a distance, and\r\nfired at it. An old man who was near immediately rebuked\r\nhim, telling him that he ought on no account to have shot at a\r\nraven, for that King Arthur was still alive in the form of that\r\nbird. My father was much interested when I drew his attention\r\nto the passage I have quoted above.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Hunt mentions having made inquiries in the\r\nneighbourhood of Tintagel, which is reported to have been\r\nKing Arthur's stronghold, but could not find that the raven\r\nwas associated with him, but was told that bad luck would\r\nfollow the man who killed a chough, for Arthur was transformed\r\ninto one of these birds. This is from the colour of the beak\r\nand talons; the\r\n\r\n\"Talons and beak all red with blood,\"\r\n\r\nare said to mark the violent end to which this celebrated chieftain\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\"What Artemidorus has delivered concerning the ravens,\"\r\nsays Strabo, \"sounds very much like a fable. He tells us there\r\nis a certain lake near the ocean, which is called the lake of the\r\ntwo ravens, because two ravens appear in it, which have some\r\nwhite in their wing;[*] that such as have any controversy together\r\n\r\n* How the raven was turned from white to black is thus mentioned in a\r\nGrecian story. It seems Apollo sent his feathered attendant to a fountain\r\nto fetch water for sacrifice. The raven found a fig-tree with fruit very\r\nnearly ripe, and waited until they were quite so, that he might satisfy his\r\nappetite. Then, having to devise some excuse for the delay, he took the\r\nwater-snake out of the fountain, brought it with the pitcher to Apollo, and\r\ntold the god that the snake had daily drunk the fountain dry. But Apollo,\r\nwho was not to be imposed upon, turned the disobedient raven black,\r\nbesides condemning it to be always plagued with thirst at the same season\r\nof the year, and to give token of its punishment by its painful croaking.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious story of the blackbird that its original colour was white,\r\nbut it became black because one year three days were so cold, that it had\r\nto take refuge in a chimney. These days, remarks Mr. Swainson, Jan.\r\n30, 31, and Feb. 1, are called in the neighbourhood of Brescia, \"I giorni\r\ndella merla,\" the blackbird's days.",

A\r\nraven built its nest near him, and frequently stole the provisions\r\nof the monks; on which one of them who wished to try\r\nhis hand at a miracle, prayed that it might be punished, and it\r\nfell dead.\r\n\r\nA raven flew away with one of the gloves belonging to St.\r\nColumbanus, but it came back and restored it at the call of the\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nThe raven, it must be added, however, has been regarded\r\nfrom very early ages as an emblem of God's providence, no\r\ndoubt from the record in Holy Writ of its being employed to\r\nfeed Elijah the Prophet in his seclusion by the brook Cherith,\r\nand it was the well known ensign of the Danes at the time of\r\ntheir dominion in this country.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Jameson's \"Sacred and Legendary Art,\" she relates\r\n(following an account in \"Il Perfetto Legendario\") that St.\r\nAnthony once went to visit St. Paul the hermit, and, whilst\r\nthey were conversing, a raven let fall a loaf between them, and\r\nPaul said, \"For sixty years every day hath this raven brought\r\nme half a loaf; but, because thou hast come, my brother, lo!\r\nthe portion is doubled, and we are fed as Elijah was in the\r\nwilderness.\"\r\n\r\nA FEELING of attachment, not without superstition, procures\r\nthe STORK an unmolested life in all Moslem\r\ncountries; and a notion of their utility as public scavengers\r\nprotects them in Switzerland, Western Germany, and Holland.\r\nThe Dutch regard them as birds of good omen, and happy is\r\nthe roof where they make their domicile. A stork's nest is the\r\ncrown of the house. Gervase of Tilbury says of the stork,\r\nthat he is both bird and man. \"The transformation of storks",
  "p3950.png": "into men,\" observes Mr. Kelly, \"and vice vers\u00e2, is an article of\r\npopular belief in Friesland, and in Prussia, where it is forbidden\r\nto hurt a stork, \"for he is elsewhere a man.\" A Flemish\r\nlegend recounts that a citizen of Bruges met a man near Mount\r\nSinai, who told him they were neighbours in Bruges, for the\r\nnest of the one was next door to the house of the other. In\r\nconfirmation of this statement, the stork-man showed a ring he\r\nhad stolen from the Fleming, once upon a time, and gave it\r\nback to him, on condition that he would not for the future\r\nallow his herdsman to molest his feathered neighbour.\" The\r\nsame author from whom I have quoted, remarks that the stork\r\nis known in Holland, Denmark, and North Germany as a fire-fowl\r\nand baby-bringer. In Hesse, a waggon-wheel--emblem of\r\nthe sun, is laid upon the roof for the stork to build his nest\r\non. The house on which he builds is safe from fire, and his\r\nnest must not be disturbed, lest the house should be struck by\r\nlightning. Adebar, or Odebaro, an ancient German name of\r\nthe stork, means literally child, or soul-bringer; and it is not\r\nunknown to Hans Andersen's readers, that Danish ladies are\r\noften obliged to keep their beds because the stork, which has\r\nbrought another little brother or sister to the house, has bitten\r\nmamma in the legs.\r\n\r\nIn North Germany, the first time in the year that a girl hears\r\nthe stork, if it clatter with its bill, she will break something; if\r\nit be flying, she will be a bride before the year is out; if it be\r\nstanding, she will be asked to stand godmother.\r\n\r\nBy the timely use of a superstition respecting the stork,\r\nAttila, in 452, obtained Aquileia. He had given orders to raise\r\nthe siege, but as he rode round the walls, pensive, angry, and\r\ndisappointed, he observed a stork preparing to leave her nest\r\nin one of the towers, and to fly with her infant family towards\r\nthe country. He seized, with the ready penetration of a statesman,\r\nthis trifling incident which chance had offered to superstition,\r\nand exclaimed, in a loud and cheerful tone, that such a\r\ndomestic bird, so constantly attached to human society, would\r\nnever have abandoned her ancient home, unless these towers",
  "p3960.png": "had been devoted to impending ruin and solitude. The favourable\r\nomen inspired an assurance of victory; the siege was\r\nrenewed, and a large breach was made in a part of the wall\r\nfrom whence the stork had taken her flight. The Huns\r\nmounted to the assault with fury, and Aquileia was at length\r\nlaid in ruins. In \"The Magick of Kirani, King of Persia, and\r\nof Harpocratian,\" to which I have already alluded, there is an\r\naccount of the medical virtues of the stork, which is described\r\nas being \"a very good bird;\" and there is this account of a\r\nbird-battle, and its superstitious results: \"Presently, when the\r\nspring comes, they (the storks) proceed altogether, like an army,\r\nand fly in divers figures, as wild geese and ducks; and all sorts\r\nof birds fly out of Egypt, Lybia, and Syria, and come into\r\nLycia, to a river called Xanthus, and in the same place they\r\nengage in battle with ravens, and crows, and magpies, vultures,\r\nand with all carnivorous fowl; for they know the time aforehand,\r\nand all come hither. The army of storks put themselves\r\nin battalia on one side of the river, and the crows and vultures,\r\nand all the carnivorous birds tarry on the other side of the river.\r\nAnd they tarry the whole six month for battel, for they know\r\nthe days whereon they are to engage. And then a cry is heard\r\nto the very heavens, and the shedding of the blood of the\r\nwounded birds is seen in the river, and the plucking off of\r\nmany feathers of which the Lycians make feather beds. And\r\nafter that the field is cleared, they find the crows and all\r\ncarnivorous birds torn to pieces; likewise storks and pelicans,\r\nand no small number of such as are on their side, for many\r\nof the birds fall down dead in the battel. And this contention\r\namong them and victory on whether side soever it falls, is a\r\nsign to all men. For, if the army of storks be conquerors,\r\nthere will be riches and abundance of bread-corn, and other\r\nfruits of the earth; but, if the crows get the better, there will be\r\na multitude of sheep and oxen, and other four-footed beasts.\r\n\r\n\"And the storks have another certain excellent quality, for\r\nwhen the parents are grown old, and are not able to fly, their\r\nchildren, on every side, carry them on their wings from place to",
  "p3970.png": "place, and also maintain them; and if they be blind, their\r\nchildren feed them; this retribution and due gratitude from\r\nchildren to parents is called antipelargia, i.e. stork gratitude.[*]\r\nAnd, if anyone take the heart of a stork, conqueror in war, and\r\ntie it up in the skin of a hawk or a vulture, that is conquered;\r\nand write on the heart, 'because I have conquered my enemies,'\r\nand shall tie it to his right arm, he that carries it will be invincible\r\nby all, and admirable in war and in all controversies,\r\nand his victory will be irrefragable and great.\" Pliny says of\r\nthe CRANES: \"They maintain a set watch all the night long,\r\nand have their sentinels. These stand upon one foot, and\r\nhold a little stone in the other, which, by falling from it, if they\r\nshould chance to sleep, might awaken them, and reprove them\r\nfor their negligence. Whilst these watch, all the rest sleep,\r\ncrouching their heads under their wings; sometimes they rest\r\non one foot, and then shift to the other.\"\r\n\r\nPiccolomini, Duke of Amalfi, took for device, in token of his\r\nvigilance, a crane with his left leg raised, and a pebble in its\r\nclaw, with the motto \"Officium natura docet.\"\r\n\r\nIn Lily's \"Euphues,\" we find: \"What I haue done, was onely\r\nto keep myselfe from sleepe, as the Crane doth the stone in hir\r\nfoote; and I would also, with the same Crane, I had been\r\nsilent, holding a stone in my mouth.\" Also, \"The tongue of\r\na louer should be like the poynt in the Diall, which, though it\r\ngo, none can see it going; or a young tree, which, though it\r\ngrowe, none can see it growing; hauing always the stone in\r\ntheir mouth, which the Cranes vse when they flye ouer mountaines,\r\nleast they make a noise.\"\r\n\r\nTHE PELICAN has a remarkable interest as a symbol of\r\nour Lord, and as such has been introduced into our\r\nchurches, and on funeral monuments. The account of its life-*\r\n\r\n* In the \"Birds,\" Aristophanes says:\r\n\r\n\"'Tis an ancient law\r\nAmong the birds, on the storks' tables writ,\r\nSoon as the father stork hath nourished all\r\nHis brood, and made them fit for flight, in turn\r\nThe younglings should support their aged sire.\"",
  "p3980.png": "*giving properties is thus given by Bossewell: \"The pellicane\r\nferuently loueth her byrdes: yet when they ben haughtie, and\r\nbegin to waxe bolde, they smite her in the face and wounde her,\r\nand she smiteth them againe, and sleaeth them. And after\r\nthree days she mourneth for them, and then striking herself in\r\nthe side till the bloude runne out, she sparpleth it upon their\r\nbodyes, and by vertue thereof they quicken againe.\"\r\n\r\nGavasse, the French historian, says it is the cock-pelican that\r\nperforms this miracle.\r\n\r\n\"Of such a nature is the pelican,\" says Philippe de Thaun, in\r\nthe \"Bestiary,\" \"when it comes to its young birds, and they\r\nare great and handsome, it will fondle them, and cover them\r\nwith its wings. The little birds are fierce; take to pecking it;\r\ndesire to eat it, and peck out its two eyes. Then it pecks and\r\nleaves them, and slays them with torment, and thereupon leaves\r\nthem; leaves them lying dead. Then returns on the third day;\r\nis grieved to find them dead, and makes such great lamentation\r\nwhen it sees its little birds dead. With its beak it strikes its\r\nbody, that the blood issues forth, and the blood goes dropping\r\nand falls on its young birds. The blood has such quality by it,\r\nthey come to life.\r\n\r\n\"This bird signifies the Son of St. Mary; and we are the\r\nyoung birds in the shape of men, who are raised, restored from\r\ndeath, by the precious blood which God shed for us; as the\r\nlittle birds are which are dead during three days. Now hear\r\nby science what that signifies; why the little birds peck at the\r\nfather's eye, and the father is angry when it kills the birds thus.\r\nHe who denies truth will put out the eye of God, and God of\r\nthat people will take vengeance;--have in remembrance. That\r\nis the meaning.\"\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. altered the three cranes which were part of\r\nCranmer's arms, into three pelicans, telling him \"those birds\r\nshould signify to him that he ought to be ready, as the pelican\r\nis, to shed his blood for his young ones brought up in the faith\r\nof Christ. For, said the king, you are likely to be worsted if\r\nyou stand to your tackling at length.\"",
  "p3990.png": "\r\nEucherius and Jerome describe the pelican as an emblem,\r\n\"by whose blood we are healed.\"\r\n\r\nSkelton, in his \"Armoury of Beasts,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"Then sayd the pellicane,\r\n\"When my birdts be slayne,\r\nWith my bloude I them reuyue.\r\nScrypture doth record\r\nThe same dyd our Lord,\r\nAnd rose from deth to lyue.\"\r\n\r\nThe notion that pelicans feed their young with their blood\r\narose from the fact that they have a large sack, or bag, attached\r\nto their under-bill. When the parent-bird is about to feed its\r\nbrood, it macerates small fish in the bag, or pouch, then, pressing\r\nthe bag against its breast, transfers the macerated food to the\r\nmouths of the young ones.\r\n\r\nThe maternal love of the pelican has been the frequent theme\r\nof poets. Thus Drayton, in \"Noah's Flood\":\r\n\r\n\"The loving pelican\r\nWhose young ones poison'd by the serpent's sting,\r\nWith her own blood to life again doth bring.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Hamlet,\" Laertes, reproached by the king, says:\r\n\r\n\"To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms\r\nAnd, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,\r\nRepast them with my blood.\"\r\n\r\nI HAVE alluded, in the first chapter of this work, to the SWAN\r\nas the harbinger of good-fortune to the mariner. The\r\nclassical fable about the bird relates that King Daunus slew\r\nDiomed, his guest, for having sacrilegiously wounded Venus\r\nwith his sword. The companions of Diomed, lamenting his\r\ndeath, were changed into swans, which are said, on the approach\r\nof death, to chaunt melancholy dirges. Venus and her son\r\nclaimed the bird, as well as Apollo, and, sacred to him, it has\r\nbeen the bird of the Muses, in almost all languages, from\r\nHomer to Callimachus. Swans were fed and kept as sacred\r\nbirds on the Eurotus, and were reverenced in Sparta as emblems\r\nof Aphrodite, the moon.",
  "p4000.png": "\r\nThe song of the dying swan was a fancy well adapted to\r\npoetical embellishment and illustration. The swans of the river\r\nM\u00e6ander were supposed to be the most zealous in these dirges,\r\nOvid makes Dido begin her pathetic remonstrance to \u00c6neas\r\nwith an appeal to this circumstance:\r\n\r\n\"Sic, ubi vocant, udis abjectus in herbis,\r\nAd vada M\u00e6andri concinit albus olor.\"\r\n\r\nIn Martial's epigrams the swan murmurs sweet strains with a\r\nfaltering tongue, itself the singer of its own dirge:\r\n\r\n\"As how to swans, their truth's reward, belong\r\nA joyful death, and sweet expiring song.\"\r\n\r\nThe superstition that swans never sing but in their expiring\r\nmoments, is used not only by the ancient poets, but also by the\r\norators and philosophers. O mutis quoque piscibus donatura\r\ncygni, si libeat, sonum, says Horace to Melpomene. Cicero\r\ncompares the excellent discourse which Crassus made in the\r\nsenate a few days before his death, to the melodious singing of\r\na dying swan: Illa tanquam cygnea fuit divini hominis vox et\r\noratio. Socrates used to say that good men ought to imitate\r\nswans, who, perceiving by a secret instinct, and a sort of divination,\r\nwhat advantage there is in death, die singing with joy:\r\nProvidentes quid in morte boni sit, cum cantu et voluptate\r\nmoriuntur. Erman, in his travels in Siberia, says of the cygnus\r\nolor, \"The bird, when wounded, pours forth its last breath in\r\nnotes most beautifully clear and loud.\" For the legends of the\r\n\"Swan-maidens,\" I must refer the reader to the pages of Mr.\r\nBaring Gould, and also to the myth of the Swan-knight, which\r\nled to the institution of the \"Order of the Swan,\" in 1440, by\r\nFrederic II. of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nIreland has many traditions about the swan; one in particular\r\nhas been immortalised by Thomas Moore, in his ballad of\r\n\"Fionnuala.\" She was the daughter of Lir, and, transformed\r\ninto a swan, was condemned to wander for many hundred years\r\nover the lakes and rivers of Ireland, until the introduction of\r\nChristianity into that island.",
  "p4010.png": "\r\nLeland's \"Cygnea Cantio\" (dedicated to Henry VIII.) takes\r\nup the old poetic notion of the singing of the swan; in behalf\r\nof which he quotes Virgil, Ovid, Lucretius, Martial, and others;\r\nand feigns the poem as the song of a kingly swan that swims on\r\nthe Thames, \"midius bissenas inter flumineas volucres,\" from\r\nOxford to Greenwich, and sings the fame of the places on the\r\nriver's bank, and the deeds of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nShakspeare makes Portia order sweet music during Bassanio's\r\ndeliberation on the caskets:\r\n\r\n\"Let music sound, while he doth make his choice:\r\nThen if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,\r\nFading in music.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after the Moor has slain his innocent bride, Emilia sings\r\nwhile her heart is breaking:\r\n\r\n\"Hark! canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,\r\nAnd die in music--Willow, willow, willow.\"\r\n\r\nAfter King John is poisoned, his son, Prince Henry, is told\r\nthat in his dying frenzy \"he sung.\" The prince answers:\r\n\r\n----\"Tis strange that death should sing--\r\nI am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,\r\nWho chaunts a doleful hymn to his own death;\r\nAnd from the organ-pipe of frailty, sings\r\nHis soul and body to their lasting rest.\"\r\n\r\nTennyson sings of the \"dying swan\":\r\n\r\n\"The wild swan's death-hymn took the soul\r\nOf that waste place with joy\r\nHidden in sorrow; at first to the ear\r\nThe warble was low, and full, and clear;\r\nAnd floating about the under-sky,\r\nPrevailing in weakness, the coronach stole\r\nSometimes afar, and sometimes anear;\r\nBut anon her awful jubilant voice,\r\nWith a music strange and manifold\r\nFlow'd forth on a carol free and bold.\"\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Russia the swan is looked upon as a bird\r\nwhich ought not to be shot at, and tradition affirms that if a\r\nswan which has been killed is shown to children, they will all\r\ndie. In one of the metrical romances a hero sees a wondrous",
  "p4020.png": "swan--its plumage all golden, its head formed of red gold, set\r\nwith pearls--and is going to let fly an arrow at it, when it cries\r\naloud, \"Do not shoot at me!\" comes flying up to him, and\r\nturns into a fair maiden, who afterwards becomes his wife.\r\n\r\nTHE COCK occupies a prominent position in bird-lore.\r\nMany and various are the superstitions connected with\r\nit in all ages and countries. In the journey to heaven of\r\nMohammed and Gabriel, they met the wondrous bird, whose\r\nfeet are in the lowest, whilst its head is in the highest heaven,\r\na distance of three thousand years asunder. Gabriel informed\r\nhis companion that this bird was a cock, adding, that every\r\nspecies of animals had angelic representations in heaven; but\r\nthat the cock was most honoured, because it was ever the first\r\nto pay morning homage to its Creator. The brilliant appearance\r\nof the bird, the splendour of the emeralds and rubies\r\nthat adorned its wings, and the melody of its notes, surpass\r\nall powers of description. The crowing of this cock is heard\r\nby all beings, except men and Jins; its cessation will be one\r\nof the signs of the near approach of the resurrection. The\r\ndescription of this wonderful bird in the Koran is borrowed\r\nfrom the Talmud of Babylon, almost word for word. The Rabbinical\r\ndoctors have taken the story from the Persian Simorg,\r\nto which I have alluded at the commencement of this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn Purchas we find: \"In the beginning of the night (say the\r\nJews) God causeth all the gates of heaven to be shut, and the\r\nangels stay at them in silence, and sendeth evil spirits into the\r\nworld, which hurt all they meet; but after midnight they are\r\ncommanded to open the same. This command and call is\r\nheard of the cocks, and therefore they clap their wings and\r\ncrow to awaken men, and then the evil spirits lose their power\r\nof hurting, and in this respect the wise men have ordained\r\nthem a thanksgiving to be said at cock-crowing: Blessed art\r\nthou, O God! Lord of the whole world, who hast given understanding\r\nto the cock.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abb\u00e9 Pluchet, in his \"History of the Heavens,\" observes:",
  "p4030.png": "\"The cock, commonly placed by the side of Horus and Anubis,\r\nor Mercury, very plainly signified what was to be done in the\r\nmorning, as the owl marked out the assemblies that were to be\r\nheld in the evening. Cocks and cockrels were then made so\r\nmany new monitors foretelling futurity.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the curious superstitious customs in which fowls are\r\nmade to play a part, may be mentioned a passage in Sir\r\nSamuel Baker's \"Exploration of the Nile Sources.\" \"I was\r\nmet,\" he says, \"by the chief and several of his people, leading\r\na goat, which was presented to me, and killed immediately as\r\nan offering close to the feet of my horse. The chief carried a\r\nfowl, holding it by the legs with its head downwards. He approached\r\nmy horse, and stroked his fore-feet with the fowl, and\r\nthen made a circle around him by dragging it upon the ground;\r\nmy feet were then stroked with the fowl, and I was requested to\r\nstoop so as to enable him to wave the bird around my head; this\r\ncompleted, it was also waved around my horse's head ... the\r\nknife put an end to its troubles, as the ceremony of welcome being\r\ncompleted, the bird was sacrificed, and handed to my head man.\r\n\r\n\"Before parting, a ceremony had to be performed by\r\nKatchiba. His brother was to be our guide, and he was to\r\nreceive power to control the elements, as deputy magician\r\nduring the journey.... With great solemnity Katchiba broke\r\na branch from a tree, upon the leaves of which he spat in\r\nseveral places. This branch, thus blessed with holy water, was\r\nlaid upon the ground, and a fowl was dragged around it by\r\nthe chief, and our horses were then operated upon precisely in\r\nthe same manner as related above.\"\r\n\r\nSchweinfurth, in his \"Heart of Africa,\" gives the following\r\ncurious auguries from cocks and hens, common to the Niam-*niams[** Niam-Niams in the book mentioned],\r\nand various negro nations: \"An oily fluid, concocted\r\nfrom a red wood called 'Bengye,' is administered to a hen. If\r\nthe bird dies, there will be misfortune in war; if it survives,\r\nthere will be victory.\r\n\r\n\"Another mode of trying their fortune consists in seizing a\r\ncock, and ducking its head repeatedly under water, until the",
  "p4040.png": "creature is stiff and senseless. They then leave it to itself. If\r\nit should rally, they draw an omen that is favourable to their\r\ndesign; if it should succumb, they look for an adverse issue.\"\r\n\r\nThe popular superstition of the cock crowing at Christmas\r\nEve, is alluded to by Shakspeare. Leigh Hunt observes, that\r\nthe poet \"has touched upon Christmas Eve with a reverential\r\ntenderness, sweet as if he had spoken it hushingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes\r\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\r\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long:\r\nAnd then, they say, no sprite dares stir abroad;\r\nThe nights are wholesome: then no planets strike,\r\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\r\nSo hallowed and so gracious is the time.\"\r\n\r\nHoratio says:\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\r\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the day,\r\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\r\n'Awake[** Awake?] the god of day; and at his warning,\r\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\r\nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies\r\nTo its confine; and of the truth herein,\r\nThis present object made probation.\"\r\n\r\nPrudentius, early in the fourth century, noticed the terror\r\nwith which the voice of the cock inspired the wandering spirits\r\nof the night:\r\n\r\n\"Ferunt vagantes d\u00e6monas\r\nLactus tenebris noctium\r\nGallo canente, exterritos,\r\nSparsim timere et credere.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the song of the cock is heard on\r\nChristmas Eve, in celebration of the divine ascent from hell,\r\nwhich the Christians in the time of Prudentius believed to\r\nhave taken place during the tranquillity of the night, when no\r\nsound was heard but that of the rejoicing bird.\r\n\r\nThe ghost of Helgi Hundisbana (the slayer of Hunding) in\r\nthe Scandinavian Edda, collected in the eleventh century, assigns\r\nthe crowing of the cock as the reason for his return to the\r\nhall of Odin, or the sun. And B\u00fcrger's demon horseman, in\r\n\"Leonora,\" in correspondence with this notion, appropriately finds",
  "p4050.png": "that he and his infernal steed, like \"the buried majesty of Denmark,\"\r\nmust speedily depart, because the cock is heard to crow.\r\n\r\nThis widely-spread superstition is, in all probability, a misunderstood\r\ntradition of some Sab\u00e6an fable. The cock, which\r\nseems by its early voice to call forth the sun, was esteemed a\r\nsacred solar bird; hence it was also sacred to Mercury, one of\r\nthe personifications of the sun. Nergal, the idol of the Cuthites,\r\nconsidered by Selden to be a symbol of the sun, was worshipped\r\nunder the form of a cock. The anecdote of Socrates,\r\nrespecting the bird sacrifice, has rendered it sufficiently notorious\r\nthat the cock was sacred to \u00c6sculapius, who was considered\r\na solar incarnation; and the story of the metamorphosis\r\nof Alectrion, by Lucian, proves its intimate connection with\r\nthis luminary in mythology.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Journal du Voyage d'Espagne\" (Paris, 1669), the\r\nauthor gives a curious legend of a cock and hen, at San\r\nDomingo de la C\u00e1lzada: \"A pilgrim was tempted by a woman,\r\nwho, to revenge the repulse which she received, hid the silver\r\nof the house in his wallet, and then accused him of theft. The\r\ngoods were found upon him, he was hanged, and left upon the\r\ngallows. Some time afterwards, the father of the pilgrim, who\r\nwas a merchant, travelled this way. Till now, he had never\r\nlearnt the fate of his son, but behold the son called to him\r\nfrom the gallows, told him he had suffered innocently, and bade\r\nhim go tell the corregidor so, who had condemned him. The\r\ncorregidor was at dinner, and said he would not believe such a\r\nstory unless the fowls before him came to life again. Immediately\r\nthey rose in full feather.\" What became of the pilgrim\r\nafter he was cut down, is not recorded; but his gallows was\r\nplaced upon the church, and the cock and hen were put in a\r\ncoop near the altar, where they had been for centuries, and\r\nwere religiously believed to be the same birds.\r\n\r\nTaylor, in his account of New Zealand, relates that a solitary\r\nturkey cock, by some means or other, found his way to a small\r\nisle in one of the lakes adjoining Rotorua, most probably having\r\nfled from the mission station at the Ngae. This bird managed",
  "p4060.png": "to acquire a kind of sanctity amongst the remaining heathen of\r\nthe district, who never paddled past poor Gobble's isle without\r\nleaving him an offering, and thus, though doomed to a life of\r\ncelibacy, he still grew fat on the offerings of his admirers.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious tradition of cock-crowing in the legendary\r\nannals of Java; Bima being asked by Kresna if he was able\r\nin the course of one night to make an inland sea below the\r\nTeng'ger mountains, and having answered in the affirmative,\r\nKresna challenged him to do it, telling him at the same time\r\nthat it must be done before the cocks were heard to crow, or\r\nthe people of the villages began to weave or beat out rice.\r\nBy three o'clock in the morning his work was so far advanced,\r\nas to convince Kresna it would be completed in the prescribed\r\ntime. To prevent this, therefore, Kresna immediately went, and\r\nrousing all the cocks and people of the villages, caused the former\r\nto crow, and the latter to begin to weave and beat out rice. By\r\nthis man\u0153uvre, Bima was obliged to leave off the work, which\r\notherwise would have been completed within the fixed time.\r\n\r\nA popular tradition in Germany was, that the devil would\r\ncontract to build a house for a peasant, and to have his soul for\r\nthe job; but he was to complete it before the crowing of a\r\ncock, or the peasant would go scot-free. The work was all but\r\nfinished; there only remained one tile to put on the roof, when\r\nthe peasant shrewdly imitated the cock's crow. All the cocks\r\nin the neighbourhood immediately took up the cry, and the\r\nfiend was baulked of his prey.\r\n\r\nFormerly, at the well of St. Tegle, sick people who came to\r\nconsult the saint brought an offering, the men a cock and the\r\nwomen a hen; the fowl was placed in a basket and carried\r\naround the well, then taken into the cemetery. The sick person\r\nwas conveyed into the church and placed under the communion-table\r\nwith a Bible on his head. He remained there\r\nsome part of the day, and was carried home after giving sixpence\r\nas an offering, and leaving the bird in the church. If it died,\r\nit was supposed to have imbibed the malady of the sick person,\r\nand the cure was regarded as certain.",
  "p4070.png": "\r\nA very ancient custom is still preserved in Russia where a\r\npeasant family migrate to a new house in order to propitiate\r\nthe house \"Domovoy,\" or domestic spirit, to go with them to\r\ntheir new quarters. When they arrive at the house, they turn\r\nthe fowls loose, and wait till the cock crows. If the cock refuses\r\nto crow, it is a sign of impending misfortune.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, we also find the same superstition that is current\r\nin our own country, that a cock crowing on the threshold of a\r\nhouse, or within the doorway, is a sign of strangers coming.\r\n\r\nA curious story is told of the employment of fowls' and\r\neagles' feathers to accomplish the feat of flying in the air, by an\r\nItalian named Damien, who, about 1503, came to Scotland,\r\nand pretending to alchemy, gave James IV. hopes of possessing\r\nthe philosopher's stone. The king gave him an abbacy for\r\nsupport. That the abbot believed in his own impostures\r\nappears from his having provided himself with wings, and\r\nattempted to fly from the battlements of Stirling Castle. He\r\nfell, of course, and broke a thigh-bone. The way in which he\r\naccounted for his want of success was very singular. \"The\r\nwings,\" he said, \"were partly composed of the feathers of dung-hill\r\nfowls, and were, by sympathy, attracted to their native\r\ndung-hill; whereas, if they had consisted entirely of eagles'\r\nfeathers, they would, for the same reason, have been attracted\r\ntowards the heavens!\" The poor abbot was, however, completely\r\nscouted.\r\n\r\nThere were some curious notions respecting domestic fowls in\r\nDerbyshire, Notts, and other places; one was for girls to peep\r\nthrough the key-holes of house-doors before opening them, on\r\nSt. Valentine's Day, when, if fortune was good to them, and\r\nthey saw a cock and a hen in company, the omen was so\r\nfavourable that it might be taken for granted the person most\r\ninterested would be married before the year was out.\r\n\r\nIn Ogee's \"Dictionnaire Historique et G\u00e9ographique de la\r\nProvince de Br\u00e9tagne,\" there is a curious account of a cock\r\nfestival in Advent. \"The festival (pardon) takes place on the\r\nfirst Sunday in Advent, and it is known by the name of the",
  "p4080.png": "'Pardon des Coqs.' Each family that day brings a cock in\r\nhonour of St Eldut. The finest one of all those that have\r\nbeen thus offered is confided to a hardy peasant who bears it\r\nto the top of the granite steeple, and places it on the weathercock.\r\nAfter resting there for a short time the cock flies off,\r\nand all the peasants hasten to catch it, as it is supposed that\r\nthe person who first catches it will have all sorts of good luck,\r\nhappiness, and prosperity during the rest of the year. Four-fifths\r\nof the cocks thus offered belong to the church, and the\r\nremaining fifth to the rector of the parish.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor cock has been the victim of superstitious practices,\r\nmore, perhaps, than any other animal, from the earliest times.\r\nSome of the ancients believed that the heart of the cock was\r\nacceptable in sacrifice, which is interpreted as relative to predictions,\r\nfor Apollo, to whom the bird was consecrated, was\r\nthe god of vaticination. Mr. Dalyell, in his \"Darker Superstitions\r\nof Scotland,\" observes that during the prevalence of\r\ninfectious diseases in the East, the cock forms an oblation to a\r\nsanguinary divinity; it is sacrificed at the entrance of the temples,\r\ndedicated to one corresponding to the Hecate of the\r\nGreeks; or it is killed over the bed of the invalid, who is\r\nsprinkled with its blood. The same oblation is offered by the\r\nwomen of Malabar. Formerly, and it may be still, a red cock\r\nwas dedicated by sick persons in Ceylon to a malignant divinity,\r\nand afterwards offered as a sacrifice in the event of recovery.\r\nThough reprobated by the priests, it is frequent in certain parts\r\nof the island. At length medicine came to be administered in\r\nEurope at the crowing of the cock, which was considered superstitious.\r\nIn Scotland, it will be recollected that a cock was\r\nburied alive for insanity, and the blood of a red cock was administered\r\nin a flour cake to an invalid, and that the female of\r\nthis bird was burnt alive as the remedy for a distemper.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the negroes of Algiers have a practice of resorting\r\nto a spot called the Seven Fountains, the supposed\r\nhead-quarters of various genii. An old negress lights a fire\r\nnear the fountain, throws on it some incense, which is inhaled",
  "p4090.png": "by those who wish to do so, after which some cocks and hens\r\nare half-killed and thrown on the sand. If in their dying\r\nstruggles they move towards the sea, the sacrifice is agreeable\r\nto the spirit invoked, and the wish of the inhalers will be accomplished.\r\nIf, on the contrary, the bird dies on the spot or\r\nmoves the wrong way, the assistants have to begin again.\r\n\r\nIn Hooker's \"Tour in Morocco,\" recently published, he\r\nmentions that in a storm in the heights of the Atlas, one of his\r\nattendants cut the throat of a cock he carried, to appease the\r\nwrath of the demons of the mountains.\r\n\r\nRalston relates a curious custom among the Russian peasants\r\nfor driving off an epidemic. The female inhabitants of a village\r\nheap up two piles of refuse at mid-day, one at each end of the\r\nstreet, and set them on fire at midnight. To one of these\r\nbonfires the girls, in white shifts, drag a plough, one of the\r\nnumber following the rest and carrying a holy picture. To the\r\nother fire a black cock is taken by the older women, and carried\r\nthree times round the flames. Then one of the women seizes\r\nit, and runs away with it to the other end of the village, the\r\nrest following and screeching, \"Ah! Ai! Adu! disappear,\r\nperish, black disease!\" When she reaches the glowing heap\r\nat the other end, she flings the bird into it.\r\n\r\nAmong the superstitions of the inhabitants of British Burmah\r\nis that of divining omens from the bones of a sacrificed fowl.\r\nThis is a solemn rite, and is used on all important occasions.\r\nThe thigh-bones of a chicken are taken out, and after prayer,\r\nand making a condition that the bones may exactly correspond,\r\nor they may differ in some particular; that the indentations for\r\nthe tendons may be like or unlike; that the bones may be even\r\nor uneven--the two bones are held up abreast of each other\r\nbetween the thumb and finger, and carefully examined. It\r\nrequires a practised eye to read the result accurately; and\r\nthere are many nice distinctions known only to the elders, who\r\ndo not always agree in their readings.\r\n\r\nIn Durham there is a superstition that if any person was\r\nbewitched, the author of the evil might be discovered by the",
  "p4100.png": "following means: to steal a black hen, take out the heart, stick\r\nit full of pins, and roast it at midnight. The \"double\" of the\r\nwitch would come and nearly pull the door down. If the\r\n\"double\" was not seen, any one of the neighbours who had\r\npassed a remarkably bad night was fixed upon.\r\n\r\nIn \"A Defence of Judiciall Astrology, in answer to a treatise\r\nlately published by M. John Chamber,\" by Sir Christopher\r\nHeydon, Knight (1603), is a curious theory in connection with\r\na hen. John Chamber asks the astrologers with an ingenuous\r\nirony, that since in a chicken there is the time of conception\r\nwith those of laying and hatching, \"if a figure flinger (a planetary\r\ndiviner) should be asked the destinie of a hen, whether\r\nshee were to die at Shrovetide, or by the foxe, or to be threshed\r\nto death, which of these three times he would take for setting\r\nhis figure?\" Whereupon the knight (Sir Christopher Heydon)\r\ncalls the gainsayer, \u0394\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd[** ?] \u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2[** First \u03b5 has an unclear diacritic], and says that to\r\nfollow him in his digressions about \"egges, chickens, hennes,\r\nputtockes, foxes,\" etc., were to show himself as vain in his\r\nanswers as the other was in his questions. Still Chamber asks\r\nthe astrologer whether, \"if the henne hatched all her chickens\r\nat once, all would have the same destiny; or how many of\r\nthem should flie away with the kite, how many die of the pippe\r\nor otherwise.\" Sir Christopher answers that the astrologer is\r\nbetter advised than to busy himself with the destiny of a hen,\r\nbut he calls his mind to what he would allow was a proof of\r\nthe power of the stars over the generation of animals, but what,\r\nunluckily for the honour of his science, is no proof of it to us,\r\nthe equinoctial generation of \"wormes, serpents, fishes, myse,\"\r\nand the like, by the heat of the sun without mother or egg.\r\n\r\nThe worship of the DOVE, and the circumstances of the\r\nDeluge, were very early interwoven among the various\r\nrites and ceremonies of the Eastern world. It was esteemed\r\nthe interpreter of the will of the Deity; the priests and soothsayers\r\nwere called ionah, or doves, and as Thebes was originally\r\nthe temple of the ark, this will account for the name.",

According to a singular legend, the Holy\r\nSpirit in the form of a dove was present at the Council of\r\nNice, and signed the creed that was there framed!\r\n\r\nOrnithological forms (remarks Didron, in his \"Iconographie\r\nChr\u00e9tienne\") have been employed by Christianity, not merely\r\nas expressive of swiftness and velocity, but of spiritual nature\r\nand the incorporeal essence. The second idea is, however,\r\ncorrelative with the first, for the soul is as buoyant as the body\r\nis weighty. Angels, bodiless spirits, are represented with wings\r\non their shoulders; they have always two, sometimes six, as is\r\nthe case with the Cherubim and Seraphim.\r\n\r\nThe Church has, like the Holy Ghost, been assimilated to\r\na dove. The pope has been allegorised, and endowed up to a\r\ncertain point with the form of a bird. Dante, however, has\r\nrepresented not the Church, but the pope as a griffin, a fantastic\r\ncreature, half-eagle and half-lion.\r\n\r\nThe dove amongst birds, from its gentle and loving nature,",

The\r\ndove rested on his head, intimating thereby that he was already\r\nfilled with the Spirit; she afterwards descended upon his\r\nshoulder. When Aredius returned to the bishop's cell the\r\ndove followed and entered with him, and for several days\r\nrefused to quit him.\"\r\n\r\nAt the consecration of Clovis the divine dove is said to have\r\npresided actually over the Christian destinies of France. Clovis\r\nand the Bishop of Rheims, St. Remi, proceeded in procession\r\nto the baptistry, where the chief of the Franks was to be consecrated\r\nking and made a Christian. When they arrived there,\r\nthe priest, bearing the holy chrism, was stopped by the crowd,\r\nand could not reach the font. But a dove, whiter than snow,\r\nbrought thither in her beak the \"ampoule\" (a phial of white\r\nglass) filled with chrism sent from heaven. St. Remi took the\r\nvessel and perfumed with chrism the baptismal water.\r\n\r\nIn a monastery at Redon, in Brittany, a child, dumb from\r\nhis birth, implored God to heal his infirmity. One day, when\r\nhe was in the field keeping the cattle of the monks, he was\r\noverpowered with sleep. On a sudden he was enveloped in a\r\nwondrous light coming from the east. In the midst of that\r\nlight there appeared to him a dove of snowy whiteness; it\r\ntouched his lips and caressed his face, saying to him, \"I am\r\nMarcellinus.\" The child arose healed, and related with his own\r\nlips what he had seen and heard.\r\n\r\nA dove (or pigeon) is considered by the Russians as a living\r\npicture (obraz) of the Holy Spirit, and therefore no Russian\r\npeasant will eat one.\r\n\r\nThe dove is an emblem most frequently met with upon\r\nprimitive sarcophagi.

She\r\nalighted in an oak, and, sitting there, began to speak with a\r\nhuman voice, and told them that on the spot where she now\r\nwas there should henceforth be an oracle of Jove.

One day he met in his road a\r\nyoung man on his way to Siena to sell some doves which he\r\nhad caught in a snare; and St. Francis said to him; \"O good\r\nyoung man! these are the birds to whom the Scripture compares\r\nthose who are pure and faithful before God. Do not kill them,\r\nI beseech thee, but give them rather to me.\" And when they\r\nwere given to him, he put them in his bosom, and carried them\r\nto his convent at Ravacciano, where he made for them nests,\r\nand fed them every day, until they became so tame as to eat\r\nout of his hand.

He had no light but a little window, \"whereat\r\nscant light shone in, that lighted him to eat such simple meat\r\nas the keeper brought him; wherefore he mourned greatly, and\r\nmade sorrow that he was thus fast shut up from the sight of\r\nmen. Nevertheless, when the keeper was gone, there came\r\ndaily a nightingale in at the window, and sung full sweetly, by\r\nwhose song this woful knight was sometimes fed with joy; and\r\nwhen the bird left off singing, then would she flye into the\r\nknight's bosome, and there this knight fed her many a day, of\r\nthe victual that God sent him. It befel after upon a day, that\r\nthe knight was greatly desolate of comfort. Nevertheless, the\r\nbird that sate in his bosome fed upon kernels of nuts, and thus\r\nhe said to the bird: 'Sweet bird, I have sustained thee many a\r\nday, what wilt thou give me now in my desolation to comfort\r\nme? Remember thyself well, how that thou art the creature of\r\nGod, and so am I also, and, therefore, help me now in this\r\ngreat need.' When the bird heard this she flew from his\r\nbosome, and tarried from him three days; but the third day she\r\ncame again, and brought in her mouth a precious stone, and laid\r\nit in the knight's bosome. And when she had so done, she took\r\nher flight and flew from him again. The knight marvelled at\r\nthe stone, and at the bird, and forthwith he took the stone in",
  "p4170.png": "his hand, and touched his gyves and fetters therewith, and presently\r\nthey fell off. And then he arose and touched the doors\r\nof his prison, and they opened, and he escaped and ran fast to\r\nthe Emperor's palace. When the keeper of the prison perceived\r\nthis, he blew his horn thrice, and raised up all the folk\r\nof the city, and led them forth, crying with an high voice, 'Lo!\r\nthe thief is gone; follow we him all.' And with that he\r\nran before all his fellows to the knight. And when he came\r\nnigh him the knight bent his bow and shot an arrow, wherewith\r\nhe smote the keeper in the lungs, and slew him; and\r\nthen ran to the palace, where he found succour against the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another story of a nightingale, with the accustomed\r\nmoral, in the \"Gesta Romanorum.\" It is entitled, \"Of\r\nhearing good Counsel.\" \"An archer, catching a little bird\r\ncalled a nightingale, was about to put her to death. But, being\r\ngifted with language, she said to him: 'What will it advantage\r\nyou to kill me? I cannot satisfy your appetite. Let me go,\r\nand I will give you three rules, from which you will derive\r\ngreat benefit, if you follow them immediately.'\r\n\r\n\"Astonished at hearing the bird speak, he promised her\r\nliberty on the conditions thus stated. 'Hear, then,' said she:\r\n'never attempt impossibilities; secondly, do not lament an\r\nirrecoverable loss; thirdly, do not credit things that are incredible.\r\nIf you keep these three maxims with wisdom, they\r\nwill infinitely profit you.' The man, faithful to his promise, let\r\nthe bird escape. Winging her flight through the air, she commenced\r\na most exquisite song; and, having finished, said to the\r\narcher: 'Thou art a silly fellow, and hast to-day lost a great\r\ntreasure. There is in my bowels a pearl bigger than the egg of\r\nan ostrich.' Full of vexation at her escape, he immediately\r\nspread his nets and endeavoured to take her a second time, but\r\nshe eluded his art. 'Come into my house, sweet bird,' said he,\r\n'and I will show thee every comfort. I will feed thee with my\r\nown hands, and permit thee to fly abroad at pleasure.' The\r\nnightingale answered: 'Now am I certain thou art a fool, and",
  "p4180.png": "payest no regard to the counsel I gave thee, \"regret not what\r\nis irrecoverable.\" Thou canst not take me again, yet thou hast\r\nspread thy snares for that purpose. Moreover, thou believest\r\nthat my bowels contain a pearl larger than the egg of an ostrich,\r\nwhen I myself am nothing near that size! Thou art a fool,\r\nand a fool thou wilt always remain!' With this consolatory\r\nassurance she flew away. The man returned sorrowfully to his\r\nown house, but never again obtained a sight of the nightingale.\"\r\n\r\nThe moral of this story is that the archer is any Christian;\r\nthe nightingale is Christ; and man attempts to kill him as\r\noften as he sins.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of St. Francis that as he was sitting with his\r\ndisciple Leo, he felt himself penetrated with joy and consolation\r\nby the song of the nightingale, and he desired his friend\r\nLeo to raise his voice and sing the praises of God in company\r\nwith the bird; but Leo excused himself on account of his bad\r\nvoice; upon which the saint himself began to sing; and when\r\nhe stopped, the nightingale took up the strain, and thus they\r\nsang alternately until the night was far advanced, and Francis\r\nwas obliged to stop because his voice failed. Then he confessed\r\nthat the little bird had vanquished him; he called it to\r\nhim, thanked it for its song, and gave it the remainder of his\r\nbread; and having bestowed his blessing on it, the creature\r\nflew away. Here we have a version of the antique legend of\r\nthe Thessalian shepherd and the nightingale, but there the bird\r\nis vanquished and dies; in this legend of St. Francis the lesson\r\nof humility is given to the man.\r\n\r\nThere are no nightingales at Havering-at-Bower, says the\r\nlegend, because Edward the Confessor, being interrupted there\r\nin his meditations, prayed that their intrusive song might never\r\nbe heard again. This does not, however, appear to be correct,\r\nfor in a work by the incumbent of Havering, the Rev. R. B.\r\nFaulkner, it is stated that the sweet notes of the nightingale are\r\nstill heard in the village.\r\n\r\nAs a portent of love, we have Milton's exquisite sonnet to\r\nthe nightingale:",
  "p4190.png": "\r\n\"O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray\r\nWarblest at eve, when all the woods are still;\r\nThou with fresh hopes the lover's heart doth fill,[** mark on page]\r\nWhile the jolly Hours lead on propitious May,\r\nThy liquid notes that close the eye of day,\r\nFirst heard before the shallow cuckoo's bill\r\nPortend success in love. O, if Jove's will\r\nHave linked that amorous power to thy soft lay,\r\nNow timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate\r\nForetell my hopeless doom in some grove nigh;\r\nAs thou from year to year, hast sung too late\r\nFor my relief, yet hadst no reason why;\r\nWhether the Muse or Love call thee his mate.\r\nBoth them I serve, and of their train am I.\"\r\n\r\nFaber, in the \"Cherwell Water Lily,\" gives an angelic character\r\nto the strains of the nightingale:\r\n\r\n\"I heard the raptured nightingale\r\nTell from yon elmy grove his tale\r\nOf jealousy and love,\r\nIn thronging notes that seem'd to fall\r\nAs faultless and as musical\r\nAs angels' strains above.\r\nSo sweet, they cast on all things round\r\nA spell of melody profound;\r\nThey charmed the river in its flowing,\r\nThey stay'd the night-wind in its blowing,\r\nThey lull'd the lily to her rest,\r\nUpon the Cherwell's heaving breast.\"\r\n\r\nThe classical fable of the unhappy Philomela may have given\r\nthe origin to the conception that the nightingale sings with its\r\nbreast impaled upon a thorn. In a sonnet by Sir Philip Sidney\r\nwe have:\r\n\r\n\"The nightingale, as soon as April bringeth\r\nUnto her rested sense a perfect waking,\r\nWhile late bare earth, proud of her clothing, springeth,\r\nSings out her woes, a thorn her song-book making;\r\nAnd mournfully bewailing\r\nHer throat in tunes expresseth.\r\nWhile grief her heart oppresseth,\r\nFor Tereus o'er her chaste will prevailing.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice of this myth by an English poet is, probably,\r\nthat in the \"Passionate Pilgrim\" of Shakspeare:",
  "p4200.png": "\r\n\"Everything doth banish moan,\r\nSave the nightingale alone.\r\nShe, poor bird, as all forlorn,\r\nLean'd her breast up till a thorn,\r\nAnd there sung the dolefull'st ditty,\r\nThat to hear it was great pity.\"[*]\r\n\r\nTHERE is a sweet legend of the ROBIN and the origin of\r\nits red breast. When our blessed Lord was bearing\r\nHis cross up Calvary, He was weak from the loss of blood,\r\nand the agony of the thorns pressing into His brow. A robin,\r\nmoved with love to his Creator, tried to extract one of the\r\nthorns, and in doing so, wounded his own breast, which, previous\r\nto this, had been brown. To commemorate the little\r\nbird's tender pity, his descendants all bear the red breast.[*]\r\n\r\n* I cannot forbear quoting the well-known exquisite words in Walton's\r\n\"Angler\" on the nightingale; who \"breathes such sweet, loud music out of\r\nher little instrumental throat, that it might make mankind to think miracles\r\nare not ceased. He that at midnight, when the very labourer sleeps\r\nsecurely, should hear, as I have very often, the clear airs, the sweet\r\ndescants, the natural rising and falling, the doubling and redoubling of her\r\nvoice, might well be lifted above earth, and say, Lord, what music hast\r\nthou provided for the saints in heaven, when thou affordest bad men such\r\nmusic on earth?\"\r\n\r\n* Horace Marryat, in his interesting \"Residence in Jutland,\" relates the\r\nfollowing legend as current in Denmark: \"It was on that fearful Friday\r\nwhen our Saviour hung in his agony upon the cross, when the sun was\r\nturned into blood, and darkness was upon all the earth, that three birds,\r\nflying from east to west, passed by the accursed hill of Golgotha. First\r\ncame the lapwing; and when the bird saw the sight before him, he flew\r\nround about the cross, crying in his querulous tone, 'Piin ham! piin ham!\r\nTorment him! torment him.' For this reason the lapwig[** typo: lapwing] is for ever accursed,\r\nand can never be at rest; it flies round and round its nest, fluttering and\r\nuttering a plaintive cry; in the swamps its eggs are stolen. Then came\r\nthe stork, and the stork cried in its sorrow and its grief for the ill deed\r\ndone, 'Styrk ham! styrk ham! Give him strength! give him strength!'\r\nTherefore is the stork blessed, and wherever it comes it is welcome, and\r\nthe people love to see it build upon their houses; it is a sacred bird and\r\nfor ever unharmed. Lastly came the swallow, and when it saw what was\r\ndone, it cried, 'Sval ham! sval ham! Refresh him! cool him!' So the\r\nswallow is most beloved of the three; he dwells and builds his nest under\r\nthe very roofs of men's houses, he looks into their very windows, and\r\nwatches their doings, and no man disturbs him either on the palaces or the\r\nhouses of the poorest peasants. For this reason, as you travel in Denmark,\r\nyou will observe the swallows' nests remain undisturbed; no one would",

Mr. MacCulloch states that\r\nhe was told by an old woman, a native of Guernsey, that the\r\nrobin was the first that brought fire to that island. In crossing\r\nthe water his feathers were singed, and his breast has remained\r\nred ever since.\r\n\r\nThe robin alone, of all birds, enjoys immunity from the ready\r\ngun of the Alpine herdsman, who believes that his cows would\r\ngive red milk if a robin were killed within his pasture-ground.\r\nIn France this immunity of the robin is universal, while the\r\nBrt\u00e9on[**Br\u00e9ton] peasant looks upon the bird with positive veneration.\r\nIn the \"Foyer Br\u00e9ton,\" of Souvestre, is a sweet legend of Jean\r\nRougegorge.\r\n\r\n\"How badly you write,\" said a schoolmaster to one of his\r\n\r\ndream for a moment of scratching them down, or destroy them as we do in\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nTo this tradition the Swedes add a fourth bird, the turtle-dove, who,\r\nperching on the cross in its anguish, cried, \"Kurrie!

It seems that the birds all met\r\ntogether one day, and settled among themselves that whichever\r\nof them could fly highest, was to be the king of them all. As\r\nthey were starting, the wren, unknown to the eagle, perched\r\nhimself on his tail. On the birds flew, and the eagle soared far\r\nabove the others, until tired, he perched himself on a rock, and\r\ndeclared that he had gained the victory. \"Not so fast,\" cried\r\n\r\n* I cannot resist, though hors de la ligne, quoting the beautiful sentiment\r\non the robin, in Warwick's \"Spare Minutes:\" \"As oft as I heare the\r\nRobin-red-breast chaunt it as cheerfully in September, the beginning of\r\nWinter, as in March the approach of the Summer, why should not wee\r\n(thinke I) give as cheereful entertainment to the hoary-frosty hayres of our\r\nage's winter, as to the primroses of our youth's spring? Why not to the\r\ndeclining sunne in adversity as (like Persians) to the rising sunne of prosperity?\r\nI am sent to the ant, to learne industry; to the dove, to learne innocency;\r\nto the serpent, to learne wisdome; and why not to this bird, to learn\r\nequanimity and patience, and to keepe the same tenour of my minde's\r\nquietnesse, as well at the approach of the calamities of winter, as of the\r\nspring of happinesse?\"",

According\r\nto this version, the tricky wren was imprisoned in a mouse-hole,\r\nand the owl was set to watch before it, whilst the other birds\r\nwere deliberating upon the punishment to be inflicted on the\r\noffender; but the owl fell asleep, and the prisoner escaped.\r\nThe owl was so ashamed, that he has never ventured to show\r\nhimself by daylight.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the first appearance of this story is in a collection\r\nof beast-fables, composed by a rabbi in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. But the resemblance between the wren story, as it is\r\ntold in Germany or in Ireland, and the story of a linnet as told\r\nby the Ojibwas of North America, is so striking a testimony\r\nof the way in which closely similar tales are framed independently,\r\nthat the two stories are worth comparing.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Ojibwa legend, the birds met together one\r\nday to try which could fly the highest. Some flew up very\r\nswift, but soon got tired, and were passed by others of stronger\r\nwings. But the eagle went up above them all, and was ready\r\nto claim the victory, when the grey linnet, a very small bird,\r\nflew from the eagle's back, where it had perched unperceived,\r\nand being fresh and unexhausted, succeeded in going the\r\nhighest. When the birds came down and met in council to\r\naward the prize, it was given to the eagle, because that bird had\r\nnot only gone up nearer to the sun than any of the larger birds,\r\nbut it had carried the linnet on its back. For this reason the\r\neagle's feathers became the most honourable marks of distinction\r\na warrior could bear.\r\n\r\nColonel Vallancey, in his \"Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis,\"\r\nspeaking of the wren as the augur's favourite bird, says that\r\nthe Druids represented it as the king of all birds.

A numerous body of men, armed\r\nwith swords and pistols, set off in search of a very small bird,\r\nwhich the ancients called troglodytes. When they have found\r\nit (a thing not difficult, because they always take care to have\r\none ready), it is suspended on a pole, which two men carry on\r\ntheir shoulders, as if it were a heavy burthen. This whimsical\r\nprocession parades around the town; the bird is weighed in a\r\ngreat pair of scales, and the company sit down to table and\r\nmake merry.\"\r\n\r\nAt Carcasonne the wren was carried about on a staff adorned\r\nwith a garland of olive, oak, and mistletoe.\r\n\r\nIn the Isle of Man the wren is believed to be a transformed\r\nfairy. The ceremony of hunting the wren is founded on an\r\nancient tradition. A fairy of uncommon beauty once exerted\r\nsuch undue influence over the male population that she seduced\r\nnumbers at various times to follow her footsteps, till by degrees\r\nshe led them into the sea, and they perished. A knight-errant\r\nlaid a plot to destroy the siren, which she only escaped by\r\nassuming the form of a wren. But though she evaded punishment\r\nat that time, a spell was cast upon her by which she was\r\ncondemned to re-animate the same form every succeeding New\r\nYear's Day, until she should perish by a human hand.

This story shows that the Celts of Man looked\r\nupon the wren as a divine being transformed, and that they\r\nhunted the bird for the sake of its talismanic feathers.\r\n\r\nAubrey, in his \"Miscellanies,\" gives the following account\r\nof the origin of wren-hunting as practised by the Irish. Speaking\r\nof the last battle fought in the North of Ireland between\r\nthe Protestants and the Papists, he says: \"Near the same\r\nplace a party of the Protestants had been surprised sleeping by\r\nthe Popish Irish, were it not for several wrens that just awakened\r\nthem by dancing and pecking on the drums, as the enemy were\r\napproaching. For this reason the wild Irish mortally hate\r\nthese birds to this day, calling them the devil's servants, and\r\nkilling them wherever they catch them. They teach their\r\nchildren to thrust them full of thorns; you'll see sometimes on\r\nholidays a whole parish running like madmen, from hedge to\r\nhedge, a wren-hunting.\"\r\n\r\nIN bird annals, the CUCKOO stands almost pre-eminent.\r\nAristotle refuted the fable that this bird was, at a certain\r\nperiod, changed into a hawk, originating, probably, from its\r\nchange of plumage.[*] A mode of divination by the cuckoo is\r\n\r\n* At a meeting of the British Association at Newcastle-on-Tyne (1863),\r\nthe Rev. H. B. Tristram said: \"The gentlemen of Durham and Northumberland\r\nbelieved that the hedgehog ate the partridge eggs; and so great\r\nwas the ignorance of natural history, that a short time ago when he\r\nremonstrated with a man for shooting a cuckoo, the defence was that it was\r\nwell known that sparrow-hawks turned into cuckoos in the summer.\"\r\n\r\nThis belief must have prevailed in Sweden, for Linn\u00e6us says of the\r\nCuculos canorus, in his Regnum Animale, \"in falconem transformari perperam\r\nasseritur.\"",
  "p4280.png": "given in an old chap-book, called the \"Golden Cabinet, or the\r\nComplete Fortune Teller:\" \"When you walk out in the spring,\r\nas soon as you hear the cuckoo, sit down on a bank, or other\r\nconvenient place, and pull your stockings off, saying, 'May\r\nthis to me, now happy be.' Then look between your great toe\r\nand the next, you'll find a hair that will easily come off. Take\r\nand look at it, and of the same colour will that of your lover\r\nbe; wrap it in a piece of paper, and keep it ten days carefully;\r\nthen, if it has not changed, the person will be constant; but if\r\nit has, you are fluttered.\"\r\n\r\nThe same superstition prevails in Ireland, and in some parts\r\nof England, that any young person on first hearing the cuckoo,\r\nwill find a hair of the colour of their sweetheart's adhering to\r\ntheir stocking, if they will at once take off their left boot and\r\nexamine it carefully.\r\n\r\nGay, in his \"Shepherd's Week\" (pastoral iv.), says:\r\n\r\n\"When first the year I heard the cuckoo sing\r\nAnd call with welcome note the budding spring,\r\nI straightway set a-running with such haste,\r\nDeborah that won the smock scarce ran so fast;\r\nTill spent from lack of breath, quite weary grown,\r\nUpon a rising bank I sat adown,\r\nThen doff'd my shoe, and by my troth, I swear,\r\nTherein I spy'd this yellow frizzled hair,\r\nAs like to Lubberkin's in curl and hue,\r\nAs if upon his comely pate it grew.\r\nWith my sharp heel I three times mark the ground,\r\nAnd turn me thrice around, around, around.\"\r\n\r\nA modern superstition is connected with hearing the cuckoo\r\nfor the first time; the hearer, on running round in a circle,\r\ninsures a freedom from idleness during the year. Probably an\r\nincentive to early rising. In Norfolk there is a belief that an\r\nunmarried person will remain single as many years as the cuckoo\r\nwhen first heard utters its call.\r\n\r\nAt the first call of the cuckoo, a German peasant does the\r\nsame thing as when he hears thunder the first time in the year;\r\nhe rolls himself two or three times on the grass, thinking himself\r\nthereby insured against pains in the back throughout the",

I will go back to the\r\nworld, enjoy its delights for twenty years, and devote the remaining\r\ntwo to penitence.\"\r\n\r\nIn the English invocation,\r\n\r\n\"Cuckoo, cherry-tree,\r\nGood bird, tell me\r\nHow many years I have to live?\"\r\n\r\nIs the cherry-tree merely brought in to make rhyme, or is there\r\nany allusion in it to the three full meals of cherries which, it is\r\nsaid, the bird must eat before it leaves off crying?[*] In Sweden,\r\ngirls bid the cuckoo sit on a bough, and tell them for certain\r\nhow many years they are to remain unmarried. If the bird\r\ncries more than ten times, they say it sits upon a foolish or\r\nbewitched bough, and they pay no heed to its augury. In that\r\ncountry it is also of much importance from what quarter of the\r\nheavens the cuckoo's voice is first heard in spring. Heard\r\nfrom the north, the unlucky side, it portends a year of sorrow\r\nto the hearer; from the east and west it betokens luck, and\r\nfrom the south it gives promise of a good butter year.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo's oracles were believed by the Poles to be actually\r\ngiven by the great god Zywie, the life-giver, who transformed\r\nhimself into the bird on purpose to utter them.\r\n\r\nIf the first note of the cuckoo comes upon you when you\r\nhave no money in your pocket, that is held, both in Germany\r\nand England, to portend want of money throughout the year.\r\n\r\n* Two of Wright's \"Latin Stories\" (Percy Society) turn upon this subject:\r\n\"41, De Cuculo, and 84, De Muliere in extremis qu\u00e6 dixit 'Kuckue.'\"\r\nIn the latter the dying woman says, \"Ego non moriar ante xii. annos;\r\naudivi cuculum qui dixit mihi;\" and she gasps out \"Kuckue\" with her\r\nlatest breath.",

In Hill's \"Naturall\r\nand Artificiall Conclusions\" (1650) we find: \"A very easie and\r\nmerry conceit to keep off fleas from your beds or chambers.\r\nPliny reporteth that if, when you first hear the cuckow, you\r\nmark well where your first foot standeth, and take up of that\r\nearth, the fleas will by no means breed, either in your house or\r\nchamber, where any of the same earth is thrown or scattered.\"[*]\r\nThis belief still exists in some parts of France.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Pharmacop\u0153ia the cuckoo was of great use.\r\nPliny tells us that if it be wrapped in a hare-skin and applied\r\nto the patient, it will produce sleep; and Rodoletius notices\r\nits ashes as good against disorders of the stomach.\r\n\r\nSuperstition gave to the frothy nidus of Tettigonia spumaria\r\nthe name of cuckoo-spittle, and it was supposed that a bird was\r\nhatched in it. This cuckoo-spittle, under the name of witches'-butter,\r\nwas one of the proofs that consigned numbers of women\r\nand children to death at Mohrah, in Sweden, in 1670.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ancients, Jupiter carried on his love intrigues\r\nunder different shapes, such as a bull, a swan, an eagle,\r\na golden shower, etc; but he chose to woo Juno in the guise of\r\na cuckoo. A seated image of the goddess shows a cuckoo upon\r\nher wand. In a bas-relief representing the marriage of Jupiter\r\nand Hera, a cuckoo sits upon the god's sceptre, and the mountain\r\nwhich was the scene of their union had its name changed\r\nfrom Thromax, or Thornax, to Oros Kokkugion--Cuckoo mountain.\r\nBacon is very harsh in his expressions against the poor\r\nbird, calling it ignoble, ridiculous, a wretched, wet, weather-beaten,\r\naffrighted, trembling, and half-starved creature. From\r\nhence he draws the moral, \"that men should not be conceited\r\nof themselves, and imagine that a discovery of their excellences\r\nwill always render them acceptable, etc.\"\r\n\r\n* Pliny (\"Nat. Hist.,\" xxx. 25): \"Aliud est cuculo miraculum, quo\r\nquis loco primo audiat illam, si dexter pes circumscribatur, ac vestigium id\r\neffodiatur, non gigni pulices, ubicumque spargatur.\"",
  "p4310.png": "\r\n\"If you wish to know,\" says Horace Marryat, in his \"Jutland\r\nand the Danish Isles,\" \"why the cuckoo builds no nest of its\r\nown, I can easily explain it according to the belief in Denmark.\r\nWhen in early spring-time the voice of the cuckoo is first\r\nheard in the woods, every village girl kisses her hand, and asks\r\nthe question: 'Cuckoo! cuckoo! when shall I be married?'\r\nAnd the old folks, borne down with age and rheumatism, inquire:\r\n'Cuckoo! when shall I be relieved from this world's\r\ncares?' The bird, in answer, continues singing 'Cuckoo!' as\r\nmany times as years will elapse before the object of their desires\r\nwill come to pass. But as many old people live to an\r\nadvanced age, and many girls die old maids, the poor bird has\r\nso much to do in answering the questions put to her, that the\r\nbuilding season goes by; she has no time to make her nest,\r\nbut lays her eggs in that of the hedge-sparrow.\"\r\n\r\nIn a Servian popular song, it is said that a sister wept incessantly\r\nover her brother's grave; but her tears at last became\r\nintolerable to the deceased, because he was detained on earth\r\nby her excessive grief, and suffered great torment. He cursed\r\nher, therefore, and in consequence of his malediction she was\r\nchanged into a cuckoo, so that she might always lament for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo is regarded with much respect in Slavonic lands.\r\nIn the old Polish \"Chronicle of Prokosz,\" it is stated that the\r\npeople believed that the god Zywie, the Lord of Life, used to\r\ntransform himself into a cuckoo, in order to address the faithful\r\nwith ominous voice. The name of the cuckoo is associated\r\nwith a singular custom of great antiquity. A few weeks after\r\nEaster--generally during the seventh week, the time of the\r\nSemic festival--the village women and girls meet together in\r\nsome spot in the woods, and there fasten to a bough a figure\r\nmade of shreds and flowers, supposed to resemble a cuckoo, and\r\nunderneath it they hang the little pectoral crosses which all\r\nRussians wear. Sometimes, instead of this, they pull up by the\r\nroots the plant called \"cuckoo-grass,\" dress it up in a shift, and\r\nthen bury it in the earth underneath two semicircles of wood,",
  "p4320.png": "set cross-ways, which they cover with handkerchiefs, and on\r\nwhich they hang crosses. In some parts of the country they\r\nplace a small cross on the figure itself, and sing:\r\n\r\n\"Gossips, darlings,\r\nBecome gossips, love each other, make presents to each other.\"\r\n\r\nThis is called the \"Christening of the Cuckoo.\"\r\n\r\nSome Cornishmen built a wall round the cuckoo to prevent\r\nthat bird from leaving the county, and thus to insure an early\r\nspring. When built, the bird flew out, crying \"Cuckoo!\r\ncuckoo!\" So they said: \"If we had put one course more on\r\nthe wall we should a' kept it.\"\r\n\r\nThe same is reported of a village of ancient renown in\r\nNotts, alluded to in the following little \"Mery Tale,\" reprinted\r\nby Mr. J. O. Halliwell: \"On a time the men of Gotham\r\nfain would have pinn'd in the cuckow, whereby she should\r\nsing all the year; and in the midst of the town they had a\r\nhedge made round in compass, and they had got a cuckow, and\r\nput her into it, and said to her, 'Sing here, and you shall lack\r\nneither meat nor drink all the year.' The cuckow, when she\r\nperceived herself encompassed within the hedge, then flew\r\naway. 'A vengeance on her!' said the wise men. 'We made\r\nnot our hedge high enough.'\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary birds, to whom many superstitions\r\nare attached, is the MAGPIE; essentially, of all\r\nthe feathered tribe, \"the knowing one.\" The variety of its\r\nclaims to popular credulity is remarkable. In many parts of\r\nour own country it is a belief that to see two birds brings sorrow;\r\nin others joy. One magpie foretells misfortune, which can, however,\r\nbe obviated by pulling off the hat and making a polite bow\r\nto the bird. In Lancashire the saying is:\r\n\r\n\"One for anger, two for mirth,\r\nThree for a wedding, four for a birth,\r\nFive for rich, six for poor,\r\nSeven for a witch, I can tell you no more.\"\r\n\r\nIn the north the magpie is thus addressed:",

Half our journey was made, when, without a word\r\nof warning, the reins were suddenly snatched out of my hands,\r\nand the pony brought to a stand. Full of astonishment, I\r\nlooked to my companion for some explanation of this assault on\r\nmy independence; I saw her gazing with intense interest on a\r\nmagpie then crossing the road. After a pause of some seconds\r\nshe exclaimed, after a sigh, 'Oh, the nasty bird! Turn back!\r\nturn back!' And back we turned.\"\r\n\r\nThe same superstition is still current in various parts of\r\nFrance. It is the usual habit of the peasants to cross themselves\r\nat the sight of a single \"chattering pie.\"\r\n\r\nMagpies are mysterious everywhere. A lady living near\r\nCarlstad, in Sweden, grievously offended a Finn woman who\r\ncame into the court of her house asking for food. The woman\r\nwas told \"to take that magpie hanging upon the wall, and eat it.\r\nShe took the bird and disappeared, with an evil glance at the\r\nlady who had been so ill advised as to insult a Finn, whose\r\nmagical powers, it is well known, far exceed those of the gipsies.\r\nNothing happened for a time; but by-and-by the lady began\r\nto observe that wherever she went one or two magpies always\r\nmade their appearance in her path. Presently the number increased,\r\nand the lady, who at first had been amused, became\r\ntroubled, and tried to drive them away by various devices. All\r\nwas to no purpose. She could not move without a large company\r\nof magpies; and they became at length so daring as to\r\nhop on her shoulder, pull her dress, and peck at her feet when\r\nshe walked. Disconcerted at this, she shut herself in her house;\r\nbut the magpies were always waiting at the door, and hopped in\r\nwhenever it was opened. Then she took to her bed in a room",
  "p4340.png": "with closed shutters, although even this was not an effectual protection,\r\nfor the magpies kept tapping at the shutters day and\r\nnight. The death of the lady is not recorded; but it is fully\r\nexpected that, die when she may, all the magpies of Wermland\r\nwill be present at her funeral.\r\n\r\nA story in the \"Knight of La Tour-Laundry,\" relates how a\r\nmagpie told a man that his wife had eaten an eel which he was\r\nfattening in a pond in his garden for himself and friends. The\r\nwife tried to excuse herself by saying the otter had eaten it;\r\nbut the husband told her he knew better, as he had heard about\r\nit from the magpie. In revenge, the lady and her maid plucked\r\nthe bird's feathers off, saying: \"Thou hast discovered us of the\r\neel.\" Ever afterwards the magpie repeated this to anyone\r\nwhom he saw with a bald head.\r\n\r\nLady Morgan, in \"Italy,\" describing the Casa Strozzi, at\r\nFlorence, mentions the lofty Doric column which was raised to\r\ncommemorate the defeat of Pietro Strozzi, and the taking of\r\nSiena by the tyrannic conqueror of both, Cosmo I., in\r\n1564. This column is surmounted by a figure of Justice. This\r\nis the scene of the tragical story of the popular drama, the\r\n\"Gazza Ladra.\" A noble lady, who resided in a house which\r\nstill stands opposite to this column, lost a valuable pearl necklace,\r\nand one of her waiting-women (a very young girl) was\r\naccused of the theft. Having solemnly denied the fact, she was\r\nput to the torture. Unable to support its terrible infliction, she\r\nacknowledged she was guilty, and without further trial was hung.\r\nShortly afterwards, Florence was visited by a tremendous storm.\r\nA thunderbolt fell on the figure of Justice and split the scales,\r\none of which fell to the earth, and with it came the ruins of\r\na magpie's nest, containing the pearl necklace![*]\r\n\r\n* One of the curiosities of the Canterbury Collection of MSS. is one\r\n(circa 1200) containing a statement of grievances of the monks of Rochester\r\nagainst the acts of their bishop, Gilbert Glanvil. This manuscript is the\r\nsubject of an interesting bird-story. Many years ago, a minor canon,\r\nwalking in his garden, heard a great clamour in the air; looking up, he\r\nsaw some jackdaws disputing for a piece of something which seemed to\r\nthem fit for nest-building. In the heat of their quarrel they dropped the",

Once on a time, when the world was\r\nvery young, the magpie, by some accident or another, although\r\nshe was quite as cunning as she is at present, was the only bird\r\nthat was unable to build a nest. In this perplexity she applied\r\nto the other members of the feathered race, who kindly undertook\r\nto instruct her. So, on a day appointed, they assembled\r\nfor that purpose, and the materials having been collected, the\r\nblackbird said, \"Place that stick there,\" suiting the action to the\r\nword, as she commenced the work, \" Ah!\" said the magpie, \"I\r\nknew that afore.\" The other birds followed with their suggestions,\r\nbut to every piece of advice the magpie kept saying, \"Ah!\r\nI knew that afore.\" At length, when the birdal habitation was\r\nhalf-finished, the patience of the company was fairly exhausted by\r\nthe pertinacious conceit of the magpie, so they all left her, with the\r\nunited exclamation, \"Well, Mistress Mag, as you seem to know all\r\nabout it, you may finish the nest yourself.\" Their resolution\r\nwas obdurate and final, and to this day the magpie exhibits the\r\neffects of partial instruction by her incomplete abode.\r\n\r\nOf all living creatures in Russia, magpies are those whose\r\nshapes witches like best to take. The wife of the false Demetrius,\r\naccording to popular poetry, escaped from Moscow in the\r\nguise of a magpie. As a general rule, no such bird is ever seen\r\nin that city, its race having been solemnly cursed by the Metropolitan\r\nAlexis, on account of the bad behaviour of the witches\r\nwho often assumed its plumage. At the present day the\r\npeasants often gibbet a dead magpie, just as our gamekeepers\r\ndo; but it is in order to scare away witches from stables and\r\ncowsheds.\r\n\r\nobject for which they contended, and the minor canon picked up, not, as the\r\nstory goes, a Saxon charter, but this very manuscript, which he kept safely\r\nas long as he lived. At his death the parchment passed into the hands of\r\nthe Rev. Frederick Roach, who retained it until 1876, when seeing that the\r\nDean and Chapter preserved their manuscripts with reverent care, he\r\nreturned it to their custody. The incident is thus explained. When the\r\nmuniments were catalogued in 1806, small store was set by those which\r\npossessed only a literary value; and these were put aside in some tower\r\nchamber, to which the jackdaws obtained access through a window.",
  "p4360.png": "\r\nWhy the SWALLOW is the friend of man is thus explained\r\nin an old legend. Adam, when descending from\r\nParadise to the earth, first put his foot on the island of Serendib,\r\nand Eve descended at Jedda. Adam, being alone, began to\r\nlament his fate in so piteous a manner that the cherubim,\r\ntouched by his lamentation, complained to the Almighty. God\r\nsent the swallow, which came to Adam, and begged him to give\r\nher some hair of his whiskers. Some historians say that Adam\r\nhad neither beard nor whiskers in Paradise, and that it began\r\nto grow only after his having been driven from the presence of\r\nthe Lord. However this may be, the swallow having got some\r\nof his whiskers, flew to Jedda, where she took also some of Eve's\r\nhair, and made in that way the first step of uniting them\r\ntogether again. In recompense for what the swallow carried on\r\nas internuncio between Adam and Eve, she is allowed to nestle\r\nin the dwellings of men.\r\n\r\nIt is an old superstition that as the winter comes on, swallows\r\nform themselves into a ball, and pass under or through the sea,\r\non their way to southern climes.\r\n\r\n\"I find,\" observes Mr. Hunt, \"a belief still prevalent among\r\nthe people in the outlying districts of Cornwall, that such birds\r\nas the cuckoo and the swallow remain through the winter in\r\ndeep caves, cracks in the earth, and in hollow trees; and\r\ninstances have been cited of these birds having been found in\r\na torpid state in the mines, and in hollow pieces of wood.\"\r\nThis belief appears to be of some antiquity, for Carew, in his\r\n\"Survey of Cornwall,\" writes as follows: \"In the west parts of\r\nCornwall, during the winter season, swallows are found sitting\r\nin the deep tynne-works, and holes in the sea-cliffes; but\r\ntouching their lurking-places, Olaus Magnus maketh a far\r\nstranger report, for he saith that in the north parts of the world,\r\nas summer weareth out, they clap mouth to mouth, wing to\r\nwing, and legge to legge; and so, after a sweet singing, fall\r\ndowne into certain lakes or pools among the caves, from whence\r\nat the next spring they receive a new resurrection; and he\r\naddeth, for proof thereof, that the fishermen who make holes",
  "p4370.png": "in the ice, to dig up such fish in their nets as resort thither for\r\nbreathing, doe sometimes light on these swallows, congealed in\r\nclods, of a slymie substance, and that carrying them home to\r\ntheir stoves, the warmth restored them to life and flight.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Russian peasants, the swallows on their arrival\r\nare said to come from Paradise to bring warmth to the earth.\r\nLike the Greeks, the Romans, and the Teutons, the old\r\nSlavonians seem to have greeted with special joy the return of\r\nthe swallow, \"the bird of God,\" as it is called in Ruthenia;\r\n\"the Virgin Mary's bird,\" as the Bohemians name it, whose\r\nearly arrival foretells an abundant harvest, whose presence\r\nkeeps off fire and lightning, and the robbing of whose nest\r\nbrings down terrible evils on the head of the robber, or, at least,\r\nbrings out freckles on his face.\r\n\r\nAubrey, in his \"Miscellanies\" (article \"Miranda\"), relates that\r\n\"At Stretton, in Hertfordshire, in anno 1648, when King\r\nCharles I. was prisoner, the tenant of the manor-house there\r\nsold excellent cyder to gentlemen of the neighbourhood, where\r\nthey met privately, and could discourse freely, and be merry,\r\nin those days so troublesome to the loyal party. Among others\r\nthat met there was old Mr. Hill, B.D., parson of the parish,\r\nquondam Fellow of Brazennose College at Oxford This\r\nvenerable good old man one day (after his accustomed fashion)\r\nstanding up, with his head uncovered to drink his Majesty's\r\nhealth, saying 'God bless our gracious sovereign,' as he was\r\ngoing to put the cup to his lips, a SWALLOW flew in at the\r\nwindow, and pitched on the brim of the little earthern cup (not\r\nhalf a pint) and sipt, and so flew out again. This was in the\r\npresence of the aforesaid Parson Hill, Major Gwillim, and two\r\nor three more that I knew very well then, my neighbours, and\r\nwhose joint testimony of it I have had more than once in that\r\nvery room. It was in the bay-window of the parlour there.\r\nMr. Hill's back was next to the window. I cannot doubt of\r\nthe veracity of the witnesses. This is printed in some book I\r\nhave seen, I think in Dr. Fuller's 'Worthies.' The cup is preserved\r\nthere still as a rarity.\"",
  "p4380.png": "\r\nIn an old receipt-book for broken bones, bones out of joint,\r\nor any grief in the bones or sinews, oil of swallows is pronounced\r\nexceeding sovereign, and this was to be procured by\r\npounding twenty live swallows in a mortar, with about as many\r\ndifferent herbs!\r\n\r\nIN the Hindoo fairy legends current in Southern India, collected\r\nfrom oral tradition by M. Frere, is a story in which\r\nthe SPARROW occupies a retributary character, a coincidence to\r\nwhich is furnished by the story of the dog and the sparrow, in\r\nGrimm's \"Collection,\" as compared with an episode in the\r\n\"Wanderings of Vicram Maharajah.\" In both a bird vows to\r\nbring about the ruin of a human being; in both the bird is the\r\nhelper and avenger of the innocent against wanton injury; and\r\nin both the destruction of the guilty is the result of their own\r\nvoluntary acts. There are other matters of likeness, the significance\r\nof which is heightened by points of singularly subtle\r\ninfluence. In the German story the sparrow is offended because\r\na carter, not heeding the warning which she had given him,\r\ndrove his waggon over a dog, which she had saved from\r\nstarving. \"You have killed my brother the dog,\" she said,\r\n\"and that shall cost you your horses and your cart\"--\"Horses\r\nand cart, indeed,\" said the carrier; \"what harm can you do to\r\nme?\" and he drove on. But presently the sparrow contrived to\r\nforce out the cork from the bung-hole of one of the casks in\r\nthe waggon, and all the wine ran out on the ground. \"Ah me,\r\nI am a poor man now,\" cried the carter when he saw it. \"Not\r\npoor enough yet,\" said the sparrow, as she perched on the head\r\nof one of the horses and pecked out his eye. The carter in his\r\nrage took up his hatchet to kill the bird; but instead of it he\r\nhit his horse, which fell down dead. So it fared with the second\r\ncask, and the two remaining horses. Leaving his waggon on\r\nthe road, the carter found his way home, and bemoaned the\r\nloss of his wine and horses. \"Ah, my husband,\" she replied,\r\n\"and what a wicked bird has come to this house: she has\r\nbrought with her all the birds in the world, and there they sit",
  "p4390.png": "among our corn, and are eating every ear of it.\"--\"Ah me, I\r\nam poorer than ever,\" said the man, as he beheld the havoc\r\n\"Still not poor enough, carrier; it shall cost you your life,\"\r\nsaid the bird, as she flew away. By-and-by the sparrow appeared\r\nat the window-sill, and uttered the same words, and the\r\ncarrier hurling his axe at it, broke the window-frame in two.\r\nEvery other piece of furniture in the house was demolished as\r\nhe vainly attempted to hit the bird. At length he caught her,\r\nand his wife asked if she should kill her. \"No,\" said he, \"that\r\nwere too merciful; she shall die much more horribly, for I will\r\neat her.\" So saying, he swallowed her whole; but she began to\r\nflutter about in his stomach, and presently came again into\r\nhis mouth, and cried out, \"Carrier, it shall cost you your\r\nlife.\" Thereupon the man handed the axe to his wife, saying,\r\n\"Kill the wretch dead in my mouth.\" His wife took it and\r\naimed a blow, but missing her mark, struck her husband on the\r\nhead and killed him. Then the sparrow flew away, and was\r\nnever seen again.\r\n\r\nAubrey records, under date 1643, \"As Major John Morgan,\r\nof Wells, was marching with the king's army into the west,\r\nhe fell sick of a malignant fever at Salisbury, and was brought\r\ndangerously ill to my father's, at Broad-Chalk, where he was\r\nlodged secretly in a garret. There came a sparrow to the\r\nchamber-window, which pecked the lead of a certain panel\r\nonly, and only one side of the lead of the lozenge, and made\r\nonly one small hole in it. He continued this pecking and\r\nbiting the lead during the whole time of his sickness (which\r\nwas not less than a month). When the major went away, the\r\nsparrow desisted, and came thither no more. Two of the\r\nservants that attended the major declared this for a certainty.\"\r\n\r\nAN Isle of Wight legend respecting the PIGEON tells us, that\r\nsoon after the creation of the world, all the birds were\r\nassembled for the purpose of learning to build their nests; and\r\nthe magpie, being very sagacious and cunning, was chosen to",
  "p4400.png": "teach them. Those birds that were most industrious, such as\r\nthe wren, and the long-tailed capon, or pie-finch, he instructed\r\nto make whole nests in the shape of a cocoa-nut, with a small\r\nhole on one side; others not so diligent he taught to make\r\nhalf nests, shaped something like a tea-cup. Having thus instructed\r\na great number of birds according to their capacity, it\r\ncame to the turn of the wood-pigeon, who, being a careless and\r\nlazy bird, was very indifferent about the matter, and while the\r\nmagpie was directing him how to place the little twigs, etc., he\r\nkept exclaiming: \"What, athurt and across! what zoo! what\r\nzoo!\" At length the magpie was so irritated with his stupidity\r\nand indolence, that he flew away; and the wood-pigeon, having\r\nhad no more instruction, to this day builds the worst nest of\r\nany of the feathered tribe, consisting merely of layers of cross-twigs.\r\n\r\nMontagu gives a Suffolk version of the tale, which differs\r\nconsiderably from the above. The magpie, it is said, once\r\nundertook to teach the pigeon how to build a more substantial\r\nand commodious dwelling; but instead of being a docile pupil,\r\nthe pigeon kept on her old cry of: \"Take two, Taffy! take\r\ntwo!\" The magpie insisted that this was a very unworkmanlike\r\nmanner of proceeding, one stick at a time being as much\r\nas could be managed to advantage; but the pigeon reiterated\r\nher \"Two, take two,\" till Mag, in a violent passion, gave up the\r\ntask, exclaiming: \"I say that one at a time is enough; and if\r\nyou think otherwise, you may set about the work yourself, for I\r\nwill have no more to do with it!\" Since that time, the wood-pigeon\r\nhas built her slight platform of sticks, which certainly\r\nsuffers much in comparison with the strong substantial structure\r\nof the magpie.\r\n\r\nThe cooing of the wood-pigeon produces, it is said,\r\n\r\n\"Take two o'coo Taffy!\"\r\n\r\nalluding to the story of a Welshman, who thus interpreted the\r\nnote, and acted upon the recommendation by stealing two of his\r\nneighbour's cows.",
  "p4410.png": "\r\nIn a Carpathian song, mentioned by Mr. Ralston, is an account\r\nof the creation of the world:\r\n\r\n\"Once there was neither heaven nor earth,\r\nHeaven nor earth, but only blue sea,\r\nAnd in the midst of the sea two oaks.\r\nThere sat there two pigeons,\r\nTwo pigeons on the two oaks,\r\nAnd began to take counsel among themselves.\r\nTo take counsel and to say,\r\n'How can we create the world?\r\nLet us go to the bottom of the sea,\r\nLet us bring thence fine sand,\r\nFine sand, and blue stone.\r\nWe will sow the fine sand,\r\nWe will breathe on the blue stone:\r\nFrom the fine sand--the black earth,\r\nThe cool waters, the green grass:\r\nFrom the blue stone--the blue heavens,\r\nThe blue heavens, the bright sun,\r\nThe bright sun, the clear moon.\r\nThe clear moon, and all the stars.'\"\r\n\r\nIn Philip de Comines, we read a curious story about the\r\nwhite pigeon of Amiens: \"When our Edward IV. and Louis\r\nXI. met to swear the peace, into which the former was so\r\ndexterously led by his abler antagonist--the chancellor of England,\r\nwho was a prelate and bishop of Ely, began his oration\r\nwith a prophecy (whereof the Englishmen are never unfurnished)\r\nwhich said that in this place of Picquigny, a great\r\npeace should be concluded between France and England. The\r\nnext day after this meeting, a great number of Englishmen repaired\r\nto Amiens, some of them affirming that the Holy Ghost\r\nhad made this peace (for they grounded all on prophecies).\r\nThe reason that moved them so to say was, for that a white\r\npigeon sat on the King of England's pavillion that day of the\r\ninterview, and would not remove thence notwithstanding any\r\nnoise made in the camp. The cause thereof, as some men\r\njudged, was, for that it had rained a little, and afterward the\r\nsun shining very hot, the pigeon lighted upon this pavillion\r\n(being higher than the rest) to dry herself; which reason was\r\ngiven by a gentleman of Gascoine, servant to the King of",
  "p4420.png": "England, called Lewis of Bretailles, who was not a little\r\noffended with the peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe pigeon was in ancient times consecrated to the thunder-god,\r\nand in some places in Russia, Slavonic children still sing\r\nto the rain when they want it to stop: \"Do not come, O rain!\r\nthree pigeons will come flying, will take thee on their wings, and\r\nwill carry thee into foreign parts.\" After the Russians had become\r\nChristians, they retained their reverence for the bird, but\r\nconsidered it sacred to the Third Person of the Trinity, instead of\r\nto Perun; and so to this day they look upon the slaying of a\r\npigeon as a great sin, one which will bring a murrain upon the\r\nherds of the perpetrator. Pigeons are supposed to bring good\r\nluck with them, and to assure the house they haunt against fire.\r\nIf a building does catch fire, a white pigeon will extinguish the\r\nflames, if it is thrown among them; on the other hand, the\r\nflying of a pigeon into a house through the window, forebodes\r\na conflagration.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by the credulous that the pigeons (in especial\r\nfavour at Venice) are in some way connected with the prosperity\r\nof the city; that they fly round it three times every day\r\nin honour of the Trinity; and that their being domiciled in the\r\ntown is a sign that it will not be swallowed up by the waves.\r\nWhen it is high water, they perch on the top of the tower.\r\n\r\nDasent, in his \"Popular Tales from the Norse,\" states\r\nthat in Norway the black red-crested WOODPECKER\r\nis called \"Gertrude's bird;\" and a Norse tale, in which the\r\nnames alone are Christian, and all the rest purely heathen,\r\nmakes the bird a transformed baker. \"In those days when\r\nour Lord and St. Peter wandered upon earth, they came once\r\nto an old wife's house who sat baking. Her name was Gertrude,\r\nand she had a red mutch on her head. They had\r\nwalked a long way, and were both hungry, and our Lord begged\r\nhard for a bannock to stay their hunger. Yes, they should\r\nhave it. So she took a little tiny piece of dough, and rolled it",
  "p4430.png": "out; but as she rolled it, it grew until it covered the whole\r\ngriddle.\r\n\r\n\"'Nay, that was too big; they couldn't have that.' So she\r\ntook a tinier bit still, and when that was rolled out it covered\r\nthe whole griddle just the same, and that bannock was too big\r\nshe said; they couldn't have that either. The third time she\r\ntook a still tinier bit--so tiny you could scarce see it; but it\r\nwas the same story over again--the bannock was too big.\r\n'Well,' said Gertrude, 'I can't give you anything; you must\r\njust go without, for all these bannocks are too big.' Then our\r\nLord was wroth, and said: 'Since you loved me so little as to\r\ngrudge me a morsel of food, you shall have this punishment--you\r\nshall become a bird, and seek your food between bark and\r\nhole, and never get a drop to drink save when it rains.'\r\n\r\n\"He had scarce said the last word before she was turned into\r\na great black woodpecker--or Gertrude's bird--and flew from\r\nher kneading trough right up the chimney; and till this very\r\nday you may see her flying about with her red mutch on her\r\nhead, and her body all black, because of the soot in the\r\nchimney; and so she hacks and taps away at the trees for her\r\nfood, and whistles when rain is coming, for she is ever athirst,\r\nand then she looks for a drop to cool her tongue.\"\r\n\r\nTales like that of Gertrude's bird are, remarks Mr. Walter\r\nK. Kelly, told of the cuckoo. In \"Hamlet\" we read: \"They\r\nsay the owl was a baker's daughter.\" The cuckoo was a baker\r\nor miller's man, and that is why his feathers are dusted with\r\nmeal. He robbed poor people of their dough in hard times,\r\nand when the dough swelled by God's blessing in the oven, he\r\ndrew it out and nipped off a portion of it, crying out each time\r\n\"Gukuk!\" (Look! look!) To punish him, God turned him\r\ninto a bird of prey that is everlastingly repeating the same cry.\r\n\r\nAccording to another legend, our Lord passed by a baker's\r\nshop, from which there came a pleasant smell of fresh bread,\r\nand sent His disciples in to beg for a loaf. The baker refused\r\nit, but his wife, who was looking on from a distance with her six\r\ndaughters, gave it in secret. For this, she and her daughters",
  "p4440.png": "were placed in heaven as the seven stars (the Pleiades; English,\r\nhen with her chickens), but the baker was turned into a cuckoo:\r\nand so long as his cry is heard in the spring, from St. Tiburt's\r\nto St. John's Day, the seven stars are visible in the heavens.\r\n\r\nSome of the North American Indians wear the head of a\r\ncertain woodpecker, believing its ardour and courage will enter\r\ninto their system.",
  "p4450.png": "\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEGGS.\r\n\r\nTHE EGG was undoubtedly regarded as a symbol by the\r\nold mystics, sometimes of our mundane system, and\r\nsometimes of the earth only, properly so called. In the first\r\ncase the yolk was supposed to represent our world; the white,\r\nits circumambient firmament, or atmosphere; and the shell,\r\nthe solid \"crystalline sphere\" in which the stars were set. In\r\nthe latter case the idea had reference to the seminal principle\r\nresiding in the egg, which likened it to the chaos of our early\r\ncosmogonists, containing the seeds of all things. This opinion\r\nappears to have originated in one of those distorted refractions\r\nof inspired truth so common in our ancient mythologies. In\r\nthe Mosaic narrative of creation, the Spirit of God is represented\r\nas \"moving\" (or according to our best critics as \"brooding\")\r\nover the waters of the great deep, as a bird over her eggs, to\r\nbring forth and develop the latent life. Milton himself, no\r\nmean authority, so understands the passage:\r\n\r\n\"Dove-like sat'st brooding o'er the vast abyss;\"\r\n\r\nand the notion appears so thoroughly to have permeated the\r\npantheistic creed of Egypt, that all their temples--roof, walks,\r\nand portico--teem with representations of wings in every expressive\r\nattitude, outspread, cowering, brooding, fanning, or protecting.\r\nUnder this view there would be a very striking analogy\r\nbetween the ark and this crude, unfashioned earth, as both containing\r\n\"the rudiments of the future world.\" It is, therefore,\r\nnot at all unlikely that the egg may have symbolised both.",
  "p4460.png": "\r\nAccording to the theory of Dr. Lamb (\"Hebrew Characters\r\nDerived from Hieroglyphics\"), the egg typified the promised\r\nMessiah, the seed that, in its full development, was to bruise\r\nthe serpent's head. In support of this view, he reproduces the\r\nwell-known representation of the Ph\u0153nician egg encircled in\r\nthe genial folds of the agatho demon, who, under the form of a\r\nserpent, is gradually warming it into life.\r\n\r\nSouthey, speaking of Do\u00f1a Oliva's treatise on the \"Compostura\r\ndel Mundo,\" observes: \"She illustrates the Mundane\r\nsystem by comparing it to a large ostrich's egg, with three whites\r\nand eleven shells, our earth being the yolk. The water, which\r\naccording to this theory surrounded the globe, she likened to\r\nthe first or innermost albumen; the second and more extensive\r\nwas the air; the third, and much the largest, consisted of fire.\r\nThe eleven shells were so many leaves, one inclosing the other,\r\ncircle within circle, like a nest of boxes. The first of these\r\nwas the first heaven, wherein the Moon has her appointed place;\r\nthe second, that of the planet Mercury; the third, that of\r\nVenus; the fourth was the circle of the Sun; Mars, Jupiter,\r\nand Saturn, moved in the fifth, sixth, and seventh; the eighth\r\nwas the starry sky; the ninth, the crystalline; the tenth, the\r\nprimum mobile, which imparts motion to all; and the eleventh\r\nwas the immobile, or empyreum, surrounding all, containing all,\r\nand bounding all; for beyond this there was no created thing,\r\neither good or evil.\"\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the presence of eggs at ancient mysteries was\r\nesteemed as belonging to the new-birth idea. The Cyprus\r\nVenus was associated with an egg, and so was the Babylonian\r\nAstarte. The festivals were at Easter, or spring. The eggs of\r\nGreen Thursday were formerly devoted to Thor. The spring\r\nwas, also, the festival of eggs with the Tasmanians, though,\r\nbeing on the other side of the Line, it was held in November.\r\nMr. Oldfield has given remarkable particulars about such a\r\nfestival on the Murchison river of Western Australia, It was\r\ncalled the Caa-ro.\r\n\r\nIn the Dionusiaca, and in other mysteries, one part of the",
  "p4470.png": "nocturnal ceremonies consisted in the consecration of an egg.\r\nBy this, as we are informed by Porphyry, was signified the\r\nworld. It seems to have been a favourite symbol, very ancient,\r\nand adopted among many nations. The Syrians used to speak\r\nof their ancestors, the gods, as the progeny of eggs. In the\r\ntemple of the Dioscuri, in Laconia, there was suspended a large\r\nhieroglyphical egg. This egg was sometimes attributed to\r\nLeda, and sometimes to Nemesis, the deity of justice. At\r\nother times a serpent was described around it, either as an\r\nemblem of that Providence by which mankind was preserved,\r\nor else to signify a renewal of life from a state of death; as the\r\nserpent by casting its skin seems to renew life. By the bursting\r\nof the egg was denoted the opening of the ark, and the disclosing\r\nto light whatever was contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe Orphic cosmogony (as preserved by Athenagoras) states\r\nthat \"Water and mud were the first principles of creation; from\r\ntheir union proceeded a being having the body of a serpent,\r\nwith the heads of a bull and a lion, and a man's in the middle.\r\nThis being was named Hercules, or Chronos, and laid an egg,\r\nout of which came forth the god Phanes; of the two halves of\r\nthe shell were formed heaven and earth.\"\r\n\r\nAristophanes, in his play of the \"Birds,\" goes back as far as\r\nthe cosmogony, and shows how at first black-winged Night laid\r\na wind-egg, whence lovely Eros, with golden pinions (doubtless\r\na bird), soared aloft, and then gave birth to all things.\r\n\r\n\"Chaos and Night,\r\nBlack Erebus, and squalid Tartarus,\r\nWere first of all; earth, air, nor heaven was yet.\r\nBut in unmeasur'd gulfs of Erebus\r\nThe black-wing'd Night first lays a windy egg,\r\nWhence in the circling hours sprang wish'd-for Love,\r\nThe golden feathers glittering on his back\r\nResembling the tempestuous vortices;\r\nHe through the wide domains of Tartarus\r\nMingled with Chaos' darkly-wing'd form,\r\nBegot our race and brought us forth to light.\"--Act i. Sc. 6.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Hindoo superstition, the world is said to\r\nhave lain in embryo, in the mind of Brahm, until the creation;\r\nwhen he spoke, light appeared; from himself came the inert",
  "p4480.png": "matter to fill up space; water was condensed from around,\r\nseeds appeared and vegetated.\r\n\r\nAgain Brahm spoke, and on the surrounding water floated a\r\ngolden egg, in which were three emblems of wisdom, power,\r\nand destruction, or birth, increase, and death, in the forms of\r\nthe gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva: or the first of the nature\r\nof earth, the second of water, and the third of fire. The shell\r\nof the egg is said to have burst into fourteen fragments; seven\r\nflying upwards, formed as many superior worlds; the remainder\r\npassing downwards, were converted into an equal number of\r\ninferior ones.\r\n\r\nAnother version states that Brahm having created nature in\r\nthe form of a married woman, Bowaney, the mother of the\r\ngods, she produced three eggs, which enacted the part of the\r\none above mentioned; having done this, she became resolved\r\ninto three female forms, thus creating a wife for each.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiians believe that the large island of Hawaii was\r\nproduced by the bursting of an egg, which had been laid on\r\nthe water by a bird of great size, and that there was no other\r\nland. Did not the instinct of our own forefathers, too, give utterance\r\nto this oracle, \"Everything springs from the egg, it is the\r\nworld's cradle?\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, so Chinese writers relate, when all was\r\ndarkness and confusion, there came from a vast mundane egg,\r\nwhich divided itself into two parts, a human being, who is, and\r\nhas always been known in Chinese annals as Poon-Koo-Wong.\r\nOf the upper portion of the shell, this being formed the heavens,\r\nand of the lower part he made the earth.\r\n\r\nThe cosmogony of the Japanese, according to Klaproth, is,\r\nthat at first the heaven and the earth were not separated; the\r\nperfect principle and the imperfect principle were not disjointed;\r\nchaos, under the form of an egg, contained the breath (or\r\nvapour), self-produced, including the germs of all things. Then\r\nwhat was pure and perfect ascended upwards, and formed the\r\nheavens (or sky), whilst what was dense and impure coagulated,\r\nwas precipitated, and produced the earth.",

From this world a giant, who had conquered\r\nheaven, made a woman; and she, by a crocodile, became\r\nthe mother of the human race. The family of the Congues\r\nwore tails to their breeches, in memory and honour of their\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\nThe Chyin (one of the wild tribes of British Burmah) account\r\nof the genesis of the human race is as follows: After the\r\nearth, sun, moon, and stars had appeared--though to what\r\ncause these owed their origin is not clear--the earth, of its own\r\nproductive and generative power, gave birth to a woman who\r\nwas named Hlee-neu. She produced a hundred eggs, from\r\nwhich were born the different races of men. One egg which\r\nfailed to hatch with the others she threw away; but a certain\r\nbird found it, and sat on and hatched it, when it produced\r\ntwo beings, a boy and a girl, who were eventually married.\r\n\r\nIn the Australian creed, the earth lay in darkness till one\r\nof the former race threw a hen's egg into space, where it\r\nbecame the sun.\r\n\r\nOoscopy and Oomantia were two methods of the ancients of\r\ndivination by eggs. An example under the former name is\r\nrelated by Suetonius, who says that Livia, when she was anxious\r\nto know whether she would be the mother of a boy or girl,\r\nkept an egg in her bosom at a proper temperature, until a\r\nchick with a beautiful cockscomb came forth. Oomantia\r\ndenotes a method of divining the signs or characters appearing\r\nin eggs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny, Umbricius, the most skilful aruspex of\r\nhis own time, stated that the vulture laid thirteen eggs; that\r\nwith one egg it purified the others and its nest, and afterwards\r\nthrew it away.\r\n\r\nDr. Jamieson observes, that eggs always forming a part of the\r\nrural feast of Beltine (supposed to be in honour of the sun), it is\r\nnot improbable that this rite of the symbolic egg is as ancient as\r\nthe heathen institution of the festival. As it appears that the\r\nGauls called the sun \"Bel,\" or \"Belus,\" in consequence of their",

It is well known that they\r\nrepresented the heavenly bodies as oviform, and worshipped an\r\negg in the orgies of Bacchus as an image of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians also worshipped Cneph, the architect of the\r\nworld, with an egg issuing from his mouth.[*] In the hymns\r\nascribed to Orpheus, Phanes, the first-born god, is said to be\r\nproduced from an egg. On these principles the story of the\r\n\"Serpentine Egg,\" to which the Druids ascribed such virtues,\r\nmay be explained. As they were greatly attached to mystery,\r\nthey most probably considered the egg to be a symbol of\r\nfecundity, and in this respect might consecrate it in the worship\r\nof the sun whom they acknowledged, in their external rites at\r\nleast, as the universal parent.\r\n\r\nAs one of the badges of his office, every Druid had an egg\r\nhung about his neck enchased in gold, according to Pliny, who\r\ndescribes it as \"about the bigness of a moderate apple; its\r\nshell is a cartilaginous incrustation, full of little cavities, such as\r\nare on the legs of the polypus.\" The manner of its production\r\nwas reported, according to the historian, to have been most\r\nextraordinary. It was said to be composed of the joint saliva\r\nof a bed or cluster of snakes, intertwined together, and never\r\nto be discovered but by its being lifted up in the air by the\r\nhissing of the snakes; when it was caught in a clean white\r\ncloth before it fell to the ground. But this interference with\r\ntheir progeny was violently resented by the serpents, from\r\nwhom the person seizing the egg was obliged to escape on\r\nhorseback at full speed. The test of its being a genuine egg\r\nof this kind was truly marvellous. When \"enclosed in gold\"\r\nit was thrown into a river, and if genuine would swim against\r\nthe stream. The ancient Britons abstained from eating eggs, on\r\n\r\n* The Egyptians, if the resurrection of the body had been a tenet of\r\ntheir faith, would, perhaps, have thought an egg no improper hieroglyphic\r\nrepresentation of it, the exclusion of a living creature by incubation, after\r\nthe vital principle has laid a long while dormant, or seemingly extinct,\r\nbeing so truly marvellous.

In\r\nHakluyt's \"Voyages\" (ed. 1589), he speaks of the common people\r\nin Russia carrying eggs coloured red on that day, and gentlemen\r\nand gentlewomen having theirs gilded. \"When two\r\nfriends meete during the Easter Holydayes, they come and take\r\none another by the hand; the one of them saith, 'The Lord,",

The other answereth, 'It is so of a trueth,'\r\nand then they kiss and exchange their egges.\"\r\n\r\nThe red colour mentioned is in memory of the blood of\r\nChrist shed for sin.[*] In Germany, sometimes instead of eggs\r\nat Easter, an emblematical print was presented. One of these\r\nis preserved in the Print-Room of the British Museum. Three\r\nhens are shown upholding a basket, in which are placed three\r\neggs ornamented with representations illustrative of the resurrection.\r\nOver the centre egg, the Agnus Dei, with a chalice\r\nrepresenting Faith, the other eggs bearing the emblems of Hope\r\nand Charity.

One of\r\ntheir sports is in striking their eggs one against another, and\r\nthe egg that first breaks is won by the owner of the egg that\r\nstruck it. Immediately another egg was pitted against the\r\nwinning one, and so it went on until the last remaining egg is\r\ndeclared victor.\r\n\r\nA similar custom to this is recorded in Hone's \"Every-day\r\nBook\" (vol. i. p. 427) as occurring on the borders of the Solway\r\nFrith[**?: Firth|P3 no].

A successful egg, in the contest with\r\none which had previously gained honours, adds to its number\r\nthe reckoning of its vanquished foe. An egg which is a 'cock'\r\noften or a dozen is frequently challenged.\"\r\n\r\nThe same contributor to the \"Every-day Book\" (writing\r\nunder date March 19, 1825) mentions a custom prevalent in\r\nsome parts of Cumberland, of sending reciprocal presents of\r\neggs at Easter to the children of families between whom any\r\nintimacy subsisted. The modes adopted to prepare the eggs\r\nfor presentation were their being immersed in hot water for a\r\nfew moments, and the end of a common tallow-candle was\r\nmade use of to inscribe the names of individuals, dates of particular\r\nevents, etc. The warmth of the egg rendered this a\r\nvery easy process. Thus inscribed, the egg was placed in a\r\npan of hot water, saturated with cochineal, or other dye-woods;\r\nthe part over which the tallow had been passed was impervious\r\nto the operation of the dye, and consequently, when the egg\r\nwas removed from the pan, there appeared no discoloration\r\nof the egg where the inscription had been traced, but the egg\r\npresented a white inscription on a coloured ground.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, and in the north of England generally, it is still\r\ncustomary to boil eggs hard, and give them to children for toys\r\non Easter Sunday.[*] In these places children ask for their\r\n\r\n* The reason for giving an egg to an infant whose career has just commenced\r\nmight be to wish the child life without end, or as long as possible,\r\nin conformity with the shape of the egg.",

The performers were called\r\npace-eggers.\r\n\r\nThis was a relic of former customs connected with Easter\r\neggs, for Father Carmeli, in his \"History of Customs,\" mentions\r\nthat during Easter, and the following days, hard eggs,\r\npainted of different colours, but principally red, were the ordinary\r\nfood of the season in Italy, Spain, and in Provence, where\r\nin the public places there were certain sports with eggs. This\r\ncustom he derives from the Jews or the Pagans, for he observed\r\nit in both. In \"Sketches of Germany and the Germans in\r\n1834, 1835, 1836,\" the writer observes that \"Easter is another\r\nseason for the interchange of civilities, when instead of the\r\ncoloured egg in other parts of Germany, and which is there\r\nmerely a toy for children, the Vienna Easter egg is composed\r\nof silver, mother-of-pearl, bronze, or some other expensive\r\nmaterial, and filled with jewels, trinkets, or ducats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" observes Kohl in his \"Russia,\" \"is more amusing\r\nthan to visit the markets and stalls where the painted eggs are\r\nsold. Some are painted in a variety of patterns; some have\r\nverses inscribed on them, but the more usual inscription is the\r\ngeneral Easter greeting, 'Christohs voskress'--'Christ is risen;'\r\nor 'Eat and think of me,' etc. The wealthier do not, of course,\r\ncontent themselves with veritable eggs, dyed with Brazil wood,\r\nbut profit by the custom to show their taste and gallantry.\r\nScarcely any material is to be named that is not made into\r\nEaster eggs. At the imperial glass-cutting manufactory we saw\r\ntwo halls filled with workmen, employed in nothing else but\r\nin cutting flowers and figures on eggs of crystal. Part of them\r\nwere for the Emperor and Empress to give away as presents to\r\nthe courtiers.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent of \"Notes and Queries\" (December 21,\r\n1878) relates, concerning the collection of the \"Tulken Eggs,\"",
  "p4560.png": "that when a boy, forty years ago, he resided occasionally at one\r\nof the old castles in the southern part of Wexford county, in\r\nIreland, and at Easter-time a peculiar custom was observed.\r\nA person was sent round to the different tenants, by whom\r\neggs were given to him for the landlord. The number of eggs\r\nseemed optional, but the contribution had evidently some feudal\r\nbearing in reference to the land. The process was called \"collecting\r\nthe Tulken eggs.\"\r\n\r\nSir R. K. Porter, in his \"Travels,\" mentions that at a period\r\nof the year corresponding to Easter, the \"Feast of Novroose, or\r\nof the waters,\" is held, and seems to have had its origin prior\r\nto Mohammedanism. It lasts for six days, and is supposed to\r\nbe kept in commemoration of the Creation and the Deluge--events\r\nconstantly synchronised and confounded in pagan cosmogonies.\r\nAt this period eggs are presented to friends, in\r\nobvious allusion to the Mundane egg, for which Ormuzd and\r\nAhriman were to contend till the consummation of all things.\r\n\r\nWhen the many identities which existed between Druidism\r\nand Magianism are considered, we can hardly doubt that this\r\nPersian commemoration of the creation originated our Easter-eggs.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia there still lingers a tradition that somewhere far\r\naway, beyond the dark seas, there dwells the happy nation of\r\nthe Rakhmane. They lead a holy life, for they abstain from\r\neating flesh all the year round, with the exception of one day,\r\nthe \"Rakhmanian Easter Sunday.\" And that festival is celebrated\r\nby them on the day on which the shell of a consecrated\r\nEaster egg floats to them across the wide sea which divides\r\nthem from the lands inhabited by ordinary mortals.\r\n\r\nLa Motte du Pougard is an ancient Druidical barrow, situated\r\nat a short distance from Dieppe, in the midst of a plain covered\r\nwith corn. It is celebrated for a festival held annually on\r\nEaster Monday, which was abolished at the time of the great\r\nRevolution. At this f\u00eate a hundred eggs were put into a basket,\r\nand placed at the foot of the eminence; a circle was formed,\r\nand one of the parties took an egg, which he successively carried",
  "p4570.png": "to the top of the mound, until they were all placed there; he\r\nthen brought them back, one by one, until they were replaced\r\nin the basket. In the meantime, another man belonging to the\r\nparty ran the eggs, as it was called, that is, went as fast as he\r\ncould to Bacqueville, a village about a mile and a quarter from\r\nthe spot; and if he returned before the hundredth egg was replaced\r\nin the basket, he gained the prize of the course, a hogshead\r\nof cider, which he afterwards distributed among his friends.\r\nThe whole party now gave themselves up to rejoicing, and\r\ndanced in a ring round the mound, representing a chain without\r\nend. The egg figured in this rural f\u00eate in memory of the\r\nserpent-egg consecrated by the Druids; it was also an emblem\r\nof the year, as attested by the accounts of many religious ceremonies\r\nin different nations.\r\n\r\nThiers, in his \"Trait\u00e9 des Superstitions,\" observes that he\r\nhas known people who preserved all the year such eggs as are\r\nlaid on Good Friday, as they think them good to extinguish\r\nfires when thrown on them.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century there was a popish practice at\r\nEaster of creeping to the cross, with eggs and apples, which\r\nwas censured by John Bate, in his \"Declaration of Bonner's\r\nArticles,\" 1554.\r\n\r\nIn a sermon preached in Dorsetshire (1570), by William\r\nKeltie, it is stated that on Good Friday \"the Roman Catholics\r\noffered unto Christe eggs and bacon to be in his favour till\r\nEaster Day was past.\"\r\n\r\nAN \"eirack's\" egg, that is the first egg laid by a hen, is\r\nused in Scotland as the principal ingredient in a\r\n\"Hallow E'en\" charm; such eggs are carefully watched for,\r\nand when obtained, are preserved against the advent of that\r\nfestival. The dread hour of midnight being at hand, the\r\neirack's egg is broken raw, or rather the shell is pierced so as\r\nto admit the \"white\" exuding drop by drop. This is permitted\r\nto fall into a wine-glass, two-thirds full of clear water,\r\nuntil little is left behind but the yolk. The palm of one hand",

Gradually accumulating\r\nthere, it assumes cloudy and fantastic forms, which are supposed\r\nto foreshadow the trade of the future spouse of the person\r\nholding the glass. Sometimes a phantom-ship in full sail is\r\nrepresented, betokening a sailor; a shadowy battle foretells of\r\na soldier lover; a mass having some distant resemblance to a\r\nsheep, gives promise of a shepherd swain, and so on. But the\r\ncharm is only yet half complete. The contents of the glass\r\nhave next to be taken into the mouth, and to be retained there\r\nwhile the seeker after the secrets of futurity goes forth into the\r\nnight. Not a single drop must be swallowed until the person\r\ntrying the charm hears the name of a man or woman, as the\r\ncase may be, called out. If the \"operator\" be a village maiden,\r\nshe has not, generally, long to wait. The lads of the village\r\nare astir on such nights, and are given to calling out each other's\r\nnames to attract the attention of companions. The name first\r\nheard thus, will be the name of the future husband of her who\r\ntries the charm, and the contents of the mouth must be swallowed\r\nthe moment that the name is heard.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, at Hallow E'en, among other curious customs,\r\nthe women take the yolks from some eggs boiled hard; fill\r\nthe eggs with salt, and eat egg, shell, and salt.

The\r\nQueen of Sweden, and most of the Grandees of Rome, have\r\nlikewise beheld it with admiration, and have ordered it to be\r\ncarefully reposited, where it administers not a little matter of\r\nspeculation to our philosophers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Loyal Protestant, also, gave some further particulars respecting\r\nthis wonderful egg, to which the editor added a sketch.\r\n\"Rome, March 6, 1681. There did appear here, about the\r\nmiddle of December last, a strange and a wonderful Comet\r\nnear the Caliptick, in the sign of Libra, and in the body of the\r\nVirgin. At the same time, a prodigious egg was laid by a\r\nyoung pullet (which had never laid before), with a perfect comet\r\nin it, and as many stars in the same form as the enclosed figure\r\nshows. All the great ones of Rome have seen it--even the\r\nQueen and the Pope. What you see in the inclosed paper, is\r\nin the egg most clearly expressed, and not upon the shell. The\r\nRoman wits are now very busy guessing at what this comet and\r\nthis egg may portend.\" The account ends, \"This is an exact\r\ndraught of the egg as it was printed in Italy; but all persons\r\nare left to their own choice, whether they will believe either this,\r\nor any of our late home-bred miracles or visions.\"",
  "p4600.png": "\r\nCOCKS' eggs appeared in olden times to have had an importance\r\nutterly inconceivable. At Basle, in 1474, legal\r\nproceedings were actually taken against a cock for having laid\r\nan egg. For the prosecution it was proved, that cocks' eggs\r\nwere of inestimable value for mixing in certain magical preparations;\r\nthat a sorcerer would rather possess a cock's egg than be\r\nmaster of the philosopher's stone; and that in pagan lands\r\nSatan employed witches to hatch such eggs, from which proceeded\r\nanimals most injurious to all of the Christian faith and\r\nrace. The advocate for the defence admitted the facts of the\r\ncase, but asked what legal animus had been proved against his\r\nclient, what injury to man or beast had it effected? Besides,\r\nthe laying of the egg was an involuntary act, and, as such, not\r\npunishable by law. If the crime of sorcery were imputed, the\r\ncock was innocent; for there was no instance on record of\r\nSatan ever having made a compact with one of the brute creation.\r\nIn reply, the public prosecutor alleged that, though the\r\ndevil did not make compacts with brutes, he sometimes entered\r\ninto them; and though the swine possessed by devils, as mentioned\r\nin Scripture, were involuntary agents, yet they, nevertheless,\r\nwere punished by being caused to run down a steep place\r\ninto the sea, and so perished in the waters.\r\n\r\nThe pleadings in this case, recorded by Hemmerlin, are voluminous;\r\nsuffice it to say that the cock was condemned to\r\ndeath, not as a cock, but as a sorcerer or devil in the form of a\r\ncock, and was with its egg burned at the stake, with all the due\r\nform and solemnity of a judicial punishment.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of the cock belongs to the wide range of\r\nsorcery, which especially found believers in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries. The professors of the black art were\r\naccused of allying themselves to Satan by a host of malpractices,\r\nand amongst others by cock's eggs, from a belief that they contained\r\nserpents; thus the cock was condemned to be burnt\r\nwith the egg that it was supposed to have laid.\r\n\r\nLapeyronie, in the \"M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\"\r\nfor 1710, gives some interesting details on the pretended",

He endeavours\r\nto account for its \"Killing at a distance; it poisoneth by the\r\neye, and by the priority of vision. Now that deleterious it may\r\nbe at some distance, and destructive without corporal contaction,\r\nwhat uncertainty soever there be in the effect, there is no high\r\nimprobability in the relation. For, if plagues and pestilential\r\natomes have been conveyed in the air from different regions;\r\nif men at a distance have infected each other; if the shadowes\r\nof some trees be noxious; if torpedoes deliver their opium at a\r\ndistance, and stupifye beyond themselves; we cannot reasonably\r\ndeny that they may proceed from subtiller seeds, more\r\nagile emanations, which contemn these laws, and invade at distance\r\nunexpected. Thus it is not impossible what is affirmed\r\nof this animal; the visible rayes of their eyes carrying forth the\r\nsubtilest portion of their poison, which received by the eye of\r\n\r\n* Many fables were current respecting the cockatrice, or basilisk; the\r\nkilling by a look is alluded to by Shakspeare in \"Twelfth Night:\"\r\n\r\n\"Say thou but I,\r\nAnd that bare vowel I shall poison more\r\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\"\r\n\r\nKing Henry VI., when he hears of the death of his uncle Humphrey, the\r\ngood Duke of Gloucester, says to Suffolk:\r\n\r\n\"Come, basilisk,\r\nAnd kill the innocent gazer with thy sight.\"\r\n\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher also speak of the basilisk in the \"Woman-hater:\"\r\n\r\n\"The basilisk's death-doing eye.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was a still further refinement; that if the cockatrice first saw\r\nthe person, he killed him by it; but if the animal was first seen, he died.\r\nDryden has alluded to this fancy:\r\n\r\n\"Mischiefs are like the cockatrice's eye,\r\nIf they see first they kill, if seen they die.\"\r\n\r\nThey were supposed to penetrate steel by pecking it.",
  "p4620.png": "man or beast, infecteth first the brain, and is from thence communicated\r\nto the heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn Swan's \"Speculum Mundi\" (1635), the origin of the\r\ncockatrice, or basilisk, is thus alluded to: \"That they be bred\r\nout of an egg laid by an old cock, is scarce credible; howbeit\r\nsome affirm with great confidence, that when the cock waxeth\r\nold ... there groweth in him, of his corrupted seed, a little\r\negg with a thin film instead of a shell, and this being hatched\r\nby a toad or some such-like creature, bringeth forth a venomous\r\nworm, though not this basilisk, that king of serpents.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"British Apollo\" (edit. 1726), we find:\r\n\r\n\"Ye sons of wisdom, charming youths,\r\nResolve a doubting fair,\r\nWhether or no there's any truth\r\nIn what old folks declare;\r\nThey will affirm that they have seen\r\nCock's eggs, which I declare,\r\nIn my opinion seems akin\r\nTo eggs laid by a mare.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is waggishly given:\r\n\r\n\"A man may well in labour fall,\r\nAnd ne'er your reason shock,\r\nAs that an egg, though ne'er so small,\r\nMay be laid by a cock.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a hen has laid ninety-nine ordinary sized eggs, she lays\r\na very small one, which is called the \"cent\" egg, or cock-egg.\r\nThis egg is a peculiar one. It is very small, not so large as a\r\npigeon's, and contains no yolk, but is full of albumen. The\r\nDerbyshire folks say, that could the \"cent\" egg be hatched,\r\nforth would come a cockatrice.\r\n\r\nBIRDS' eggs appear to have been endowed with an invaluable\r\nquality, according to popular belief--that of curing\r\ndrunkenness. Thus Swan, in his \"Speculum Mundi,\" says:\r\n\"The egges of an owle broken and put into the cup of a\r\ndrunkard, or one desirous to follow drinking, will so work with\r\nhim that he will suddenlie lothe his good liquor, and be dis-*",
  "p4630.png": "*pleased with drinking.\" A very probable consequence, we may\r\nadd, of such a recipe.[*]\r\n\r\nThe same property is attached to the stork's egg, in Spain.\r\nMr. Howard Saunders writes in the Field (April 18, 1874):\r\n\"As I was walking through the Plaza de Mercado, or market-*place\r\nat Seville, with Manuel, an old fruit-seller asked him to\r\nget her a stork's egg for her son. Then came a bargain, and\r\nfinally the old lady agreed to give ten reals--an enormous price\r\nfor her, and for such an article. Manuel informed me that her\r\nson was an habitual drunkard, and it is the popular belief that a\r\nstork's egg is a certain cure for this unfortunate habit.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Gentleman's Magazine (1787) we find it stated:\r\n\"That it is usual with many persons about Exeter, who are\r\naffected with agues, to visit at dead of night the nearest cross-*road,\r\nfive different times, and there bury a new-laid egg. The\r\nvisit is paid about an hour before the cold fit is expected; and\r\nthey are persuaded that with the egg they will bury the ague.\r\nIf the experiment fail (and the agitation it occasions may often\r\nrender it successful), they attribute it to some unlucky accident\r\nthat may have befallen them on the way. In the execution of\r\nthis matter they observe the strictest silence, taking care not to\r\nspeak to anyone whom they may happen to meet.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Countess of Kent's \"Choice Manual\" (1676), we read\r\nof a curious employment of an egg as an antidote to poisons,\r\netc. \"An approved medicine for the plague, called the philosopher's\r\negg. It is a most excellent preservative against all\r\npoysons, or dangerous diseases that draw towards the heart.\r\nTake a new-laid egg, and break a hole so broad, as you may\r\ntake out the white clean from the yolk, then take one ounce of\r\nsaffron, and mingle it with the yolk,'[**s/be \"] etc.\r\n\r\nDr. Doran observes amusingly, that \"In some parts of Africa\r\nwhere eggs are very scarce, and the priests are very fond of\r\n\r\n* An owl's egg was considered by the ancients as efficacious in preserving\r\nthe hair, and making it curl; but Pliny asks who ever saw an owl's egg,\r\ninasmuch as the bird itself was a prodigy; and he further inquires who\r\ncould try it, especially on his hair?",
  "p4640.png": "them, it has been revealed to the people that it is sacrilege for\r\nany but clerical gentlemen to eat eggs! The lay scruple, if I\r\nmay so speak, is quieted by the assurance, that though the\r\nsacred hens produce only for the servants at the altar, the latter\r\nnever address themselves to the food in question, without the\r\nwhole body of the laity profiting thereby! All the eggs in\r\nAfrica, passing the \u0153sophagus of a priest, could hardly nourish\r\na layman, even though the eggs were as gigantic as those which\r\nan old author says are presented by ladies in the moon to their\r\nprofoundly delighted husbands, and from which spring young\r\nbabies, six feet high, and men at all points.\"\r\n\r\nIn East Norfolk there is a notion that if a less number of\r\nprimroses than thirteen be brought into a house on the first\r\noccasion of bringing any in, so many eggs only will each hen or\r\ngoose hatch that season.\r\n\r\nA writer on this subject in \"Notes and Queries\" observes:\r\n\"When recently admitted into deacon's orders, my gravity was\r\nsorely tried by being called on to settle a quarrel between two\r\nold women, arising from one of them having given one primrose\r\nto her neighbour's child, for the purpose of making her\r\nhens hatch but one chicken out of each set of eggs. And it\r\nwas seriously maintained that the charm had been successful.\r\n\r\n\"Since then I have heard that it only has an influence over\r\ngeese. Perhaps this may account in some measure for the\r\nbelief. In early seasons persons are induced to bring specimens\r\nof the first spring flowers that they find. In such seasons,\r\ntoo, fowls lay early, and perhaps do not sufficiently protect\r\ntheir eggs. The ungenial weather which too frequently succeeds,\r\nspoils the eggs; and the effect is attributed to the primroses, of\r\ncourse. The cases where a few flowers are brought in, and the\r\nfowls have numerous broods, remain unnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nCamden, in his \"Ancient and Modern Manners of the Irish,\"\r\nremarks that if the owners of horses eat eggs, they must take\r\ncare to eat an even number, otherwise some mischief will\r\nbetide the horses. Grooms are not allowed eggs, and the\r\nriders are obliged to wash their hands after eating them.\"",
  "p4650.png": "\r\nIn the north of England the housewife thinks it lucky to set\r\na hen on an odd number of eggs, for if she sets the hen on an\r\neven number there will be no chickens.\r\n\r\nIn Derbyshire it is considered that a hen must not be set\r\nwith twelve eggs under her, the number must be either eleven\r\nor thirteen. The latter is the best, and (unusual in most other\r\nbeliefs) a lucky number. If twelve eggs are sat upon, the hen\r\nwill scarcely succeed in hatching them; and if hatched, the\r\nchickens will do no good.\r\n\r\nA writer in Hone's \"Year Book\" observes (under date 1831),\r\n\"That it is customary with the good housewives of Norfolk,\r\non placing a 'clutch or litter' of eggs (generally thirteen) in\r\na nest for incubation (more particularly of a goose or duck),\r\nto swing a lighted candle over them at the time, as a charm,\r\nto prevent hawks, crows, or other birds of prey, flying away\r\nwith the young goslings, or ducks produced from the charmed\r\neggs.'[**s/be \"]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Brown, in his \"Vulgar Errors,\" alluding to the\r\n\"conceit of ovum decumanum,\" says it is so called because the\r\ntenth egg is bigger than any other, according to the reason\r\nalleged by Festus, \"Decumana ova dicuntur, quia ovum\r\ndecimum majus nascitur.\" For the honour we bear unto the\r\nclergy we cannot but wish this true, but herein will be found\r\nno more verity than the other (alluding to the tenth wave of the\r\nsea being more dangerous and greater than the other waves).\r\nHe adds, \"The conceit is numeral.\"\r\n\r\nCrofton Croker, in one of his \"Fairy Legends and Traditions\r\nof the South of Ireland,\" gives an amusing story (the \"Brewery\r\nof Egg-Shells\"), in which Mrs. Sullivan, fancying that her\r\nyoungest child had been exchanged by fairies theft, is recommended\r\nby Ellen Leah, a wise woman, to try the experiment,\r\nas a test, of brewing egg-shells. She put the pot on the fire,\r\nand plenty of turf under it, and set the water boiling at such a\r\nrate that, if ever water was red-hot, it surely was. \"The child\r\nwas lying for a wonder quite easy and quiet in the cradle,\r\nevery now and then cocking his eye, that would twinkle as keen",
  "p4660.png": "as a star in the frosty night, over at the great fire, and the big\r\npot upon it; and he looked on with great attention at Mrs.\r\nSullivan breaking the eggs, and putting down the egg-shells to\r\nboil. At last he asked, with the voice of a very old man,\r\n'What are you doing, mammy?' Mrs. Sullivan's heart, as she\r\nsaid herself, was up in her mouth ready to choke her, at hearing\r\nthe child speak. But she contrived to put the poker in the\r\nfire, and to answer, without making any wonder at the words,\r\n'I'm brewing, a vick' (my son). 'And what are you brewing,\r\nmammy?' said the little imp, whose supernatural gift of speech\r\nnow proved, beyond question, that he was a fairy substitute.\r\nOn Mrs. Sullivan's reply, 'Egg-shells,' the imp, starting up in\r\nthe cradle and clapping his hands, exclaimed, 'I'm fifteen\r\nhundred years in the world, and I never saw a brewery of egg-shells\r\nbefore!' The poker was by this time quite red, and Mrs.\r\nSullivan, seizing it, ran furiously towards the cradle; but somehow\r\nor other her foot slipped, and she fell flat on the floor, and\r\nthe poker flew out of her hand to the other end of the house.\r\nHowever, she got up, and on going to the cradle saw her own\r\nchild in a sweet sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe story has been told with some immaterial variations in\r\nGrose's \"Provincial Glossary,\" where it is quoted from a\r\n\"Pleasant Treatise on Witchcraft.\" For instance, Ellen Leah\r\nis there represented by an old man, and the mother of the\r\nchangeling, instead of brewing the egg-shells, breaks a dozen\r\neggs, and places the twenty-four half-shells before the child, who\r\nexclaims, \"Seven years old was I before I came to the nurse,\r\nand four years have I lived since, and never saw so many milk-pans\r\nbefore!\" The exposure of the fairy and subsequent\r\nrestitution of the woman's child form the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe custom of breaking egg-shells to avoid fascination is still\r\nretained in France.\r\n\r\nThe Connoisseur (No. 109) says, \"It is a common notion that\r\na witch can make a voyage to the East Indies in an egg-shell,\r\nor take a journey of two or three hundred miles across the\r\ncountry on a broomstick.\"",

The damsel who superintended the boiling chanted a\r\nsing-song charm during the culinary process.

She then repeated her\r\nverse for a third time, and turned herself round thrice; when\r\nthe hard-boiled eggs were deemed ready for eating. They\r\nhad no clock, dial, clepsydra, hour-glass, burning of tapers,\r\nor any other method of measuring the time necessary for\r\nthe egg-boiling than this chanting of the song; and a like\r\nkind of formula was repeated for similar domestic purposes,\r\nthose 'household words' being supposed to depend for their\r\nefficacy upon the full belief in the charm they were presumed to\r\ncause. The application of this to the incantations of witches\r\nover the concoction of some 'hell-broth' is sufficiently obvious.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Swithin, the Jupiter Pluvius of our Saxon ancestors, is",
  "p4680.png": "stated to have worked a kindly miracle in favour of an old\r\nwoman, whose basket of eggs had been wantonly broken by a\r\nworkman in his employ. The good bishop restored them all,\r\nor according to the popular legend, which converts this simple\r\nact of justice and charity into a miracle, he restored the broken\r\neggs by making them whole.\r\n\r\nTradition relates that on one occasion, St. Kevin, of Ireland,\r\nwhen he was praying at a window in the Teampul na Skellig, or\r\nthe Temple of the Rock, at Glendalough, with one hand extended\r\nin a supplicating attitude, a blackbird descended, and\r\ndeposited her eggs in his open palm. The saint, moved with\r\ncompassion for the bird, did not withdraw his hand, but\r\nremained in the same position until the creature had hatched\r\nher eggs. For which reason, in all representations of St. Kevin,\r\nhe is shown with an outstretched arm, and supporting in his\r\nhand a bird's nest.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy, and other parts of France, there is a belief in\r\nthe fowl that lays a golden egg; but to obtain such a valuable\r\ngift, the Evil One has to be invoked. The animal must be\r\ncompletely black, and the owner of it, having made the compact\r\nfor his soul, carries the bird to a point from which five roads\r\ndiverge, and cries with a loud voice, five or seven times,\r\n\"Money from my black fowl!\" the Evil One presents himself,\r\nand the golden egg is produced.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the Stamford Mercury (October 29,\r\n1852): \"There exists a species of superstition in North Nottinghamshire\r\nagainst letting eggs go out of a house after sunset.\r\nThe other day a person in want of some eggs called at a farmhouse\r\nin East Markham, and inquired of the good woman\r\nwhether she had any eggs to sell, to which she replied that she\r\nhad a few scores to dispose of. 'Then I'll take them home\r\nwith me in the cart,' was his answer; to which she somewhat\r\nindignantly replied, 'That you'll not: don't you know the sun\r\nhas gone down? You are welcome to the eggs at a proper\r\nhour of the day; but I would not let them go out of the house\r\nafter the sun is set on any consideration whatever.\"",
  "p4690.png": "\r\nIn Derbyshire, also, it is considered a bad omen to gather\r\neggs and bring them into the house after dark. Others consider\r\nthat to ensure a proper amount of laying on the part of\r\ntheir hens, it is necessary that the eggs should be collected\r\neach day in the forenoon, and be brought into the house about\r\nnoon. Eggs ought not to be brought in on Sunday, and no\r\nhen must be \"set\" on that day, or after dark on any other day\r\nof the week.\r\n\r\nThere is a belief in some parts of the country that ducks'\r\neggs brought into a house after sunset will never be hatched.\r\nIn Lincolnshire it is considered unlucky to bring eggs into a\r\nhouse after sunset; that if eggs are brought over running water,\r\nthey will have no chicks in them. Egg-shells should not be\r\nburnt, or the hens will cease to lay. In Derbyshire it was a\r\ncustom formerly to give a new-laid egg to a child on its being\r\ntaken into a house for the first time; care should be observed\r\nthat the egg was laid the same morning. This giving of an egg\r\nwas for \"luck,\" and to start the child in life with something\r\ngood and useful.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country it is believed that the first egg\r\nlaid by a white pullet, placed under the pillow at night, will\r\nbring dreams of those you wish to marry.\r\n\r\nWith regard to dreams, Chrysippus relates that a man\r\ndreamed he saw an egg hanging from the tester of his bed, and\r\nthe Oneirocritic pronounced that there was a treasure under\r\nthe couch. He dug, therefore, and found some gold with silver\r\nabout it, part of which latter he presented to his sage adviser,\r\n\"Was there no gold?\" asked the wise man; \"if not, what\r\nmeant the yolk of your egg?\" \"As if,\" Cicero exclaims, \"no\r\none else had dreamed of an egg, or without discovering a treasure;\r\nand as if there could be any necessity for the obscure\r\nintimation, and open interpretation at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Manchester it used to be believed unlucky\r\nto suspend strings of blown bird's eggs in a dwelling-house, but\r\ngood luck ensued from placing them in an outhouse. Another\r\npiece of yolk-lore relative to birds' eggs was, that \"bit-bats\"",
  "p4700.png": "were generated from eggs being sat upon by toads whilst in the\r\nprocess of hatching.\r\n\r\nAt Amboyna, in the last century, the marriage ceremony\r\nprincipally consisted in throwing, backwards and forwards, an\r\negg into the wide sleeves of the bride and bridegroom's outer\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Java, at a wedding, the bride, as a sign of\r\nher subjection, kneels and washes the feet of the bridegroom,\r\nor he treads upon a raw egg, and she wipes his foot.\r\n\r\nIt is customary after a wedding in Russia for the husband to\r\ngo to the mother-in-law's house, where she offers him an omelette.\r\nHe makes a hole in the middle of the omelette, into\r\nwhich a groomsman pours maslo--butter or oil--and then\r\nbreaks the pot from which the maslo was taken.\r\n\r\nIn what is called \"the christening of the cuckoo\" in Russia,\r\na figure of the bird is dressed up, and crosses are hung from\r\nthe sides. Two girls then walk in different directions round\r\nthe birch-trees, and meet at a circle made of their branches,\r\nthrough which they kiss each other three times, and give each\r\nother a yellow egg.\r\n\r\nAmong the Russian peasants (remarks Mr. Ralston), the\r\nRus\u00e1lkas (female water-spirits corresponding to our elves and\r\nfairies) are propitiated during a week's festival in various ways;\r\namong others, the relatives of drowned or strangled persons go\r\nout to their graves, taking with them pancakes and spirits, and\r\nred eggs. The eggs are broken, and the spirits are poured over\r\ntheir graves, after which the relics are left to the Rus\u00e1lkas,\r\nthese lines being sung:\r\n\r\n\"Queen Rus\u00e0lka[** Rus\u00e1lka ?],\r\nMaiden fair,\r\nDo not destroy the soul,\r\nDo not cause it to be choked,\r\nAnd we will make homage to thee.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Storyland Beings that haunt the imagination of\r\nthe Russian peasant is a strange creature called \"Koshchei,\r\nthe Immortal,\" who is supposed to be a mythical representation",
  "p4710.png": "of winter. Sometimes it is a hero's mother whom Koshchei\r\nsuddenly carries off; sometimes it is his wife. In either case\r\nshe is kept a prisoner until the hero finds out in what manner\r\nthe immortal one can be rendered mortal--in what place his\r\ndeath can be discovered and brought home to him. The secret\r\nis always hard to detect, but sooner or later Koshchei is\r\ngenerally induced to make some such revelation as this: \"My\r\ndeath is in such and such a place. There stands an oak, and\r\nunder the oak is a casket, and in the casket is a hare, and in\r\nthe hare is a duck, and in the duck is an egg, and in the egg is\r\nmy death.\" And when, after many adventures, the egg has\r\nbeen found and broken, Koshchei dies.\r\n\r\nIn another Russian story a prince gets hold of the fatal egg,\r\nand shifts it from one hand to the other till it breaks and\r\nKoshchei dies. In one tale a snake is substituted for the evil\r\nbeing, and its death lies in a little stone within the yolk of the\r\nmystic egg. Different animals are represented as forming the\r\nchain which secures the life of Koshchei, and of which the last\r\nlink is either an egg or a stone inside an egg. In one story,\r\nthe hero is assisted in his search for the fatal egg by the thunder,\r\nthe wind, and the hail.\r\n\r\nA curious species of divination among the Burmese is to\r\ndiscover whether the \"Ka-l\u00e1,\" soul or spirit, is destroyed or not.\r\nThe coffin of a dead person is placed in the middle of the\r\nroom. A slender rod of a peculiar sort of bamboo is thrust\r\nthrough a hole in the lid, so as to be in contact with the body.\r\nAn attenuated thread is tied to the upper end of this rod, and\r\nsmall tufts of raw cotton, alternating with lumps of charcoal,\r\nare tied along the thread until they nearly reach the lower end,\r\non which is fastened a silver or copper ring. Under the ring\r\nis placed a cup with a hard-boiled egg in it, which nearly comes\r\nin contact with the ring which hangs over it. The ring soon\r\nbegins to draw down towards the egg, it is said, and to sway\r\nbackwards and forwards. The force is sometimes so great that\r\nthe thread is broken. This is the best consummation of the\r\nomen. If the thread breaks, the ring is picked up and placed",
  "p4720.png": "in the coffin; for it is inferred that the \"Ka-l\u00e1,\" though not\r\npermitted to destroy life, is nevertheless present, and is not\r\ndivorced, or irrecoverably lost. The experiment sometimes\r\nfails, there is no acting of the ring. In this case the omen is\r\nbad. The \"Ka-l\u00e1\" is destroyed, and there is no hope for the\r\nhappiness of the departed.\r\n\r\nThis extravagant superstition seems in some way connected\r\nwith the ring-divination of the ancients, except that in this\r\nlatter process the ring was held in suspension by a living\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIn some districts of Russia it is customary for a dead man's\r\nrelations to offer the corpse eggs, butter, and money, saying,\r\n\"Here is something for you; Marfa has brought you this.\r\nWatch over her corn and cattle, and when I gather the\r\nharvest, do thou feed the chickens and look after the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a belief in a house-snake that brings all sorts of\r\ngood to the master who treats it well and gives it omelettes,\r\nwhich should be placed on the roof of the house, or on the\r\nthreshing-floor. If this is not done the snake will burn the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOne way of pacifying an irritated \"domovoy,\" or house elf,\r\namong the Russians, is for the head of the family to go out\r\nat midnight into the courtyard, to turn his face to the moon,\r\nand to say, \"Master! stand before me as the leaf before the\r\ngrass, neither black nor green, but just like me. I have brought\r\nthee a red egg.\" Thereupon the spirit will assume a human\r\nform, and when he has received the red egg, will become\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nBuckle, in his \"History of Civilisation in England\" (vol. i.\r\np. 287), speaking of the corruptions of the historians of the\r\nmiddle ages, tells us, \"It was well known that the city of\r\nNaples was founded on eggs;\" and adds the following note:\r\n\"Mr. Wright ('Narratives of Sorcery,' 1851) says, 'The\r\nfoundation of the city of Naples upon eggs, and the egg on\r\nwhich its fate depended, seem to have been legends generally",

B. Granville, M.D., F.R.S.\"\r\n(London: H. S. King and Co., 1874), we find the following curious statement:\r\n\"Some of my readers will feel disposed to laugh outright at a learned\r\ndoctor admitting he is an inveterate believer in all sorts of popular superstitions,\r\nforebodings, and presentments. I am alarmed at the spilling of a\r\nsalt-cellar; I don't like to meet a hearse while going out of the street-door;\r\nI would not undertake a journey or any important work on a Friday; and\r\nthe breaking of a looking-glass would throw me into fits. Now, this morning\r\n\"(when the doctor, on a day in 1814, was at Boulogne, and the guest of\r\nMadame Martinetti) \"soon after our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate d\u00e9jeuner[** typo? d\u00e9jeuner|P3 corrected, clear in TIA], I became suddenly\r\ndepressed in spirits to such a degree, that my fair hostess fancied I had been\r\ntaken ill. This state of nervousness and depression endured after I had\r\nretired to my hotel, and was making ready my luggage for my positive\r\ndeparture at noon on the succeeding day, leaving out only the evening dress\r\nfor the dinner and opera. On taking my place at dinner, the knife and\r\nfork laid before me crossway, startled me (I dare say I turned pale), but I\r\nsaid nothing. There were two attendants. At the next course the other\r\nvalet replaced my plate, and again the fatal cross was laid before me! I\r\nlooked round to the three guests to see if it was the habit of the servants of\r\nthe house; they had no cross, only the doctor: and again the third time the\r\nsame symbol made its appearance before me with the setting of the dessert\r\nand corresponding plates with gilt knife and fork, the two latter of which\r\narticles again contrived to be laid down in a crucial form. Ah! now there\r\nwas no mistake. Some great crossing was about to befall me. I had better\r\nshut myself up for the rest of the day, give up the proposed drive and the\r\nopera, and wait until I can escape in the morning from the doomed city.",

I have seen a minister of state turn his\r\nchair round at a whist-table in order to avert his displeasure; I\r\nhave seen a warrior to whom the safety of an army has been\r\nconfided, and not in vain, lodge an ivory fish upon a candlestick\r\nto secure her good graces. I have seen the most prudent\r\nof attorneys call for fresh cards, and pay for them, in the full\r\nconfidence that he would be gratified by that extravagant proceeding.\r\nI have known a venerable divine to lay his finger\r\nwith indecent haste upon the two of clubs, because 'whoever\r\nfirst touches the two of clubs (as he was good enough to explain\r\nto me) secures a good hand for himself' directly after\r\nthe cards are dealt. Under one's own roof, it has been said\r\nby one of the priesthood of the culte, luck changes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Duchess of Malfy\" (1640), we read:\r\n\r\n\"How superstitiously we mind our evils!\r\nThe throwing down salt, or crossing of a hare,\r\nBleeding at nose, the stumbling of a horse,\r\nOr singing of a cricket, are of power\r\nTo daunt whole man in us.\"\r\n\r\nThe general definitions of luck may be said to be \"chance,\"\r\nor \"fortune,\" and in such meanings Bailey, in his \"Dictionary\"\r\n(1755), remarks on the popular saying of \"Give a man luck and\r\nthrow him into the sea,\" that it savours a little too much of\r\nheathenism, or profaneness; but it may very well befit a Christian\r\nmouth, if that which the vulgar call \"luck,\" and the learned\r\n\"fortune,\" be denominated Providence; for if that be on a man's\r\nside, you may throw him into the sea and not be actually and\r\nlegally guilty of murder. This was verified in the prophet\r\nJonah.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients the goddess of Fortune was represented\r\n\r\nTo make matters still more formidable, I found on looking at my calendar\r\nit was Friday. All this mind-work I, of course, kept to myself, albeit I\r\nmust have appeared more stupid than was my wont.\"\r\n\r\nA few hours later Dr. Granville was arrested.",

C\u00e6sar, however, qualified the blind submission\r\nto chance by saying that though luck went a good way\r\nin war, and he took it into account accordingly, yet his first\r\ncare was to place everything as much as possible, beyond the reach\r\nof this treacherous element.[*]\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of the Romans to cast every day into an\r\nurn stones of different colours, as the person performing the\r\nceremony was fortunate or otherwise. When the day was lucky\r\nand fortune propitious, the stone was white; when unlucky,\r\nblack. At the end of the year they computed the balance of\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nThe d\u00e6mon of Socrates (remarks Leigh Hunt), may, perhaps,\r\nbe considered a spirit of \"luck,\" inasmuch as it gave him intimations\r\nrather what to avoid than to do, which saved him from\r\nmany inadvertencies; the spirit interfered on occasions that\r\nseem very trifling, though accordant with the office assigned to\r\nhim by Plato of presiding over fortuitous events. Thus Socrates\r\nwas going one day to see a friend, in company with some others,\r\nwhen he made a sudden halt, and told them that his d\u00e6mon\r\nhad advised him not to go down that street, but to choose\r\nanother. Some of them turned back, but others persisting in\r\nthe path before them, \"on purpose, as 'twere, to confute Socrates\r\n\r\n* Juvenal says: \"One lucky hour is of more consequence to a soldier\r\nthan a recommendation to Mars, either from his mistress or his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-luck and ill-luck,\" remarks Montaigne, \"are, in my opinion, two\r\nsovereign powers. It is ridiculous to think that human prudence is able to\r\nact the same part as fortune will do; and his enterprise is very vain, who\r\npresumes to secure both the causes and the consequences, and lead, as it\r\nwere by the hand, the progress of his undertaking; even more particularly\r\nin martial councils.\"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Brown says: \"Let not fortune, which hath no name in\r\nScripture, have any in thy divinity. Let Providence, not chance, have the\r\nhonour of thy acknowledgments, and be thy \u0152dipus on contingencies.\r\nMark well the paths and winding ways thereof; but be not too wise in the\r\nconstruction, or sudden in the application. The hand of Providence writes\r\noften by abbreviatures, hieroglyphics, or short characters, which, like the\r\nlaconism on the wall, are not to be made out but by a hint or key from that\r\nspirit which indicted them.\"",

Charillus, a musician,\r\nwho had come to Athens to see the philosopher Cebes, got\r\nespecially mudded, so that now and then, says Plutarch, \"he\r\nand his friends would think in merriment on Socrates his\r\nD\u00e6mon, wondering that it never forsook the man, and that\r\nheaven took such particular care of him.\" Despite of this,\r\nhowever, the pretension of Socrates to an unusual sense of his\r\nattendant spirit, did not prevent him from falling into \"ill-luck.\"\r\n\r\nMelton, in his \"Astrologaster\" (1620), has a fling, in his playful\r\nway, at the astrologers' good and evil times, and days, and\r\nomens as a superstition, and asks: \"What ill-lucke can there be\r\nin it, when a hare crosseth you, except it is your ill-luck not to\r\ncatch her; what ill-lucke can it be to a man to stumble in the\r\nmorning, except he fall down and break his nose? What ill-lucke\r\ncan there be in finding money, except it be counterfeit?\r\nMany people in these days cannot breake his shinnes, have his\r\nnose bleede, lose a game at cards, heare a dogge howle, or a\r\ncat wawle, but instantly they will runne to the calculator.\"\r\n\r\nGoldsmith, in \"The Vicar of Wakefield,\" speaking of the\r\nwaking dreams of his hero's daughters, tells us: \"The girls had\r\ntheir omens too; they felt strange kisses on their lips; they\r\nsaw rings in the candle; purses bounded from the fire; and\r\ntrue love-knots lurked at the bottom of every tea-cup.\"\r\n\r\nThe singular superstitions connected with \"luck\" may, in\r\nmany cases, be accounted for by a simple mode of reasoning;\r\nthus Sir Humphrey Davy, in his \"Salmonia,\" alludes to certain\r\nprognostics: \"Omens of death-watches, dreams, etc., are for\r\nthe most part founded on some accidental coincidence; but\r\nspilling of salt, on an uncommon occasion, may, as I have\r\nknown it, arise from a disposition to apoplexy, shewn by an\r\nincipient numbness in the hand, and may be a fatal symptom;\r\nand persons dispirited by bad omens, sometimes prepare the\r\nway for evil fortune; for confidence in success is a great means\r\nof ensuring it.

But there are thousands of us who,\r\nin this respect, are as absurdly superstitious as Quashyboo. Dr.\r\nJohnson objected to going under a ladder; Cromwell believed\r\nin the 3rd of December; Louis Napoleon in the 2nd of\r\nDecember. For 'luck,' the Emperor Augustus carried about\r\nhim a piece of a sea-calf. How many men are there who carry\r\nin their purse, for 'luck,' a shilling with a hole in it, or a crooked\r\nsixpence which they would not part with for ten times its intrinsic\r\nvalue? There are men, and women too, whose turned-out\r\npockets would reveal a tooth, an odd-looking bead, a\r\n'cramp' bone or some similar rubbish, rubbed to a state of\r\nhigh polish by constant carriage. No one admits that these\r\nthings are carried for 'luck.' They can give no reason why\r\nthey encumber the pocket with trash at all. Blushing sheepishly\r\nat being found out in their weakness, they will say they\r\nhave 'grown used' to it, or that it is only a pocket-piece.\r\nSome will be candid enough to admit that they have a 'fad'\r\nthat way, but leave you to judge for yourself what they mean by\r\n'fad,' as well as of the width and extent of the 'way' they\r\nare prepared to bear with it.\"",
  "p4790.png": "\r\nAmongst the lower orders the belief in \"luck\" is so strong,\r\nthat it will take many a year of School Board winnowing before\r\nit is got rid of. Rough men playing cards or dominoes at a\r\ntable, will gravely turn the peak of their cap to the back of their\r\nhead, or even, in extreme cases, turn the cap inside out, and\r\nwear it so as to woo a change of luck. They will, though they\r\ncan ill afford to waste it, throw away the broken crust of a loaf,\r\nshould it be ribbed with a cross, in consequence of an inequality\r\nin the bricks of a baker's oven. It would bring them \"bad\r\nluck\" if they ate it. They believe in a \"lucky look\" from a\r\nperson who squints, but it must be one glance, and have done\r\nwith it. Should the look be repeated, or even prolonged, the\r\ngood turns to evil, and they will have \"bad luck.\" At Billingsgate\r\nMarket, and at Farringdon Market as well, may be found\r\nany morning a half-silly ragged boy with a squint, who picks up\r\nmany a half-penny by dispensing \"lucky looks\" amongst the\r\nitinerant fishmongers and greengrocers, ere they begin their\r\ndaily \"round.\" In the street market-places, amongst the stall-keepers,\r\nit is reckoned to be nothing else than ruinous to turn\r\naway a \"first bid\" for an article. It brings bad luck on the\r\nday's selling, and it is better to get the \"hansel\" (as the first\r\nsale is called) over, even at a loss. In all such places, to the\r\nunlucky stall-keeper's exasperation, there are to be found mean\r\nfolks who are known as hansel-hunters, and who are early in\r\nthe field, and alert to take full advantage of the poor vendor's\r\nsuperstition. He, the vendor, is perfectly well aware of the\r\npaltry device to obtain goods at less than cost price; but though\r\nhe may swear somewhat, it is rare that he will turn away a first\r\nbid, and \"chance\" it. And when he has taken hansel money,\r\nhe would as soon think of throwing it into the road, as putting\r\nit into his pocket without first \"spitting upon it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor, in his \"Borderland of Science\" remarks of\r\ncommon superstitions: \"Reverse them, and they are as trustworthy\r\nas before. Let the superstition be that to everyone\r\nspilling salt at dinner, some great piece of good-luck will occur\r\nbefore the day is over; let seven years of good fortune be",

These\r\nnew superstitions would be before long supported by as good\r\nevidence as those now in existence; and they would be worth\r\nas much, since neither would be worth anything.\"\r\n\r\nIt is lucky to do this--unlucky to do that, say those who\r\nbelieve in common superstitions; and they can always cite many\r\ncoincidences in favour of their opinion. But it is amazing how\r\ncommon are the private superstitions entertained by many who\r\nsmile at the superstitions of the ignorant; we must suppose that\r\nall such superstitions have been based upon observed coincidences.\r\nAgain, there are tricks or habits which have\r\nobviously had their origin in private superstitions. Dr. Johnson\r\nmay not have believed that some misfortune would happen\r\nto him, if he failed to place his hand on every post which he\r\npassed along a certain route; he would certainly not have maintained\r\nsuch an opinion publicly, yet in the first instance that\r\nhabit of his must have had its origin in some observed coincidences;\r\nand when once a habit of the sort is associated with\r\nthe idea of good luck, even the strongest minds have been found\r\nunready to shake off the superstition.\r\n\r\nAn old woman came to Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, to\r\nask him whereabouts a certain bundle of linen might be, which\r\nshe had lost. Flamsteed determined to show the folly of that\r\nbelief in astrology which had led her to Greenwich Observatory\r\n(under some misapprehension as to the duties of an Astronomer\r\nRoyal). He drew a circle, put a square into it, and gravely\r\npointed out a ditch near her cottage in which he said it would\r\nbe found. He then waited until she should come back disappointed,\r\nand in a fit frame of mind to receive the rebuke he\r\nintended for her; but she came back in great delight, with the\r\nbundle in her hand, found in the very place.\r\n\r\n\"There is really no such a thing as luck\" (remarks a writer\r\nin the Times); \"it is a stupid impostor, a mere bully, which overthrows\r\na man if he does not meet it face to face, and keep his\r\npresence of mind. If he can do this, it disappears like a\r\nphantom, and leaves him in possession of the field.\"",

An old saw says,\r\n\"The girls are all stark naught that wed in May;\" and another\r\nsaying was, \"From the marriages in May all the bairns die and\r\ndecay.\" An old poet says, \"May never was ye month of love.\"\r\nAn ancient proverb, cited by Ray, says, \"Who marries between\r\nthe sickle and the scythe will never thrive.\"\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts of France a marriage contracted in May\r\nor August is unlucky. In the \"Almanach des Laboureurs,\" it is\r\nstated that a woman marrying in these months will put her\r\nhusband under the yoke. It mentions:\r\n\r\n\"Si le commun peuple dit vrai.\r\nLa mauvaise s'\u00e9pouse en Mai.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sir John Sinclair's \"Statistical Account of Scotland\"\r\n(1793), it states, \"That day of the week upon which the 14th\r\nof May happens to fall is esteemed unlucky through all the\r\nremainder of the year; none marry, or begin any business upon\r\nit. None choose to marry in January or May, or to have their",

Plutarch assigns three\r\nreasons for this objectionable month; one being, as some say,\r\nbecause May was the month of old men; and June being that\r\nof young men, the latter ought to be preferred. The Romans,\r\nhowever, held other seasons and days unpropitious for matrimony,\r\nas the days in February when the Parentalia were celebrated,\r\netc. No marriage, however, was celebrated without an\r\naugury being first consulted, and its auspices proved favourable.\r\n\r\nIn Sir Henry Ellis's edition of Brand's \"Popular Antiquities\"\r\nwe find: \"In the Roman Calendar, in my library, several days\r\nare marked as unfit for marriages: 'Nupti\u00e6 non fiunt,' i.e.,\r\nFeb. 11, June 2, Nov. 2, Dec. 1.

It has been\r\nalso suggested that the throwing of a shoe was originally intended\r\nas a sham assault on the bridegroom for carrying off the\r\nbride, and, as such, a relic of the old custom of opposition to\r\nthe capture of a bride.\r\n\r\n* Marriage was forbidden from Septuagesima Sunday until the octave of\r\nEaster, and in the three weeks before the Feast of St. John the Baptist, and\r\nfrom the first Rogation day until the octave of Whitsuntide, or until Trinity\r\nSunday; and from the first Sunday in Advent until the Epiphany, or to the\r\nmore holy until the octave of the Epiphany. Marriages in Lent were prohibited\r\nby the Council of Laodicea, and by the Council of Enham, in the\r\ntime of Ethelred II., also on high festival and Ember days, and from\r\nAdvent until the octaves of Epiphany, and from Septuagesima until fifteen\r\ndays after Easter. In the Romish Church at present, marriage is forbidden\r\nfrom the first Sunday in Advent until after the Twelfth Day, and from the\r\nbeginning of Lent until Low Sunday. This was the rule in England\r\nbefore the Reformation. Some old verses run thus:\r\n\r\n\"Advent marriage doth deny,\r\nBut Hilary gives thee liberty:\r\nSeptuagesima says thee nay,\r\nEight days from Easter says you may;\r\nRogation bids thee to refrain,\r\nBut Trinity sets thee free again.\"",
  "p4840.png": "\r\nThrowing the old shoe after the wedded pair seems to have\r\nbeen probably intended as an augury of long life to the bride.\r\nCarpentier, in his continuation of Ducange, explains the\r\nthrowing up a shoe aloft as an augury respecting the life of the\r\nperson to whom the shoe belongs: \"Vanum presagium, imo\r\nscelestum sortelegium, initio nuper act\u00e6 Quadragesim\u00e6, de illo\r\n(filio) exercuisti; ut quasi mori non posset, cujus calceamentum\r\nin altum projectum ultra trabem supervolasset.

Arnulphi.)\r\n\r\nIn the \"Raven's Almanacke\" we find, \"But at his shutting\r\nin of shop could have been content to have had all his neighbours\r\nhave throwne his olde shoes after him when hee went\r\nhome, in signe of good lucke.\" In Ben Jonson's \"Masque\r\nof the Gipsies\" (1640), this superstition is thus mentioned:\r\n\r\n3 Gypsie. \"Hurle after an old shoe,\r\nI'le be merry what 'ere I doe.\"\r\n\r\nGrose, citing Ben Jonson's saying, \"Would I had Kemp's\r\nshoes to throw after you,\" observes, that perhaps Kemp was\r\na man remarkable for his \"good luck\" or fortune.\r\n\r\nJohn Heywood has:\r\n\r\n\"Now for good luck cast an old shoe after me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Parson's Wedding\":\r\n\r\n\"Ay, with all my heart, there's an old shoe after you.\"\r\n\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher:\r\n\r\n\"Your shoes are old, pray put 'em off,\r\nAnd let one fling 'em after us.\"\r\n\r\nAn old rhyme says:\r\n\r\n\"When Britons bold\r\nWedded of old\r\nSandals were backward thrown,\r\nThe pair to tell\r\nThat ill, or well,\r\nThe act was all their own.\"\r\n\r\nIn Tennyson's \"Lyrical Monologue\" we read:",
  "p4850.png": "\r\n\"For this thou shalt from all things seek,\r\nMarrow of mirth and laughter;\r\nAnd wheresoe'er thou move, good luck\r\nShall throw her old shoe after.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans had a custom of throwing the shoe of the bride\r\namong the guests at the wedding. Good luck would attend\r\nthe fortunate person who got it, as he or she would be speedily\r\nmarried. In Scotland, a volley of old slippers or shoes is cast\r\nat the bride and bridegroom for luck.\r\n\r\nTrain, in his \"History of the Isle of Man,\" says: \"On the\r\nbridegroom leaving his house, it was customary to throw an old\r\nshoe after him, and, in like manner, an old shoe after the bride,\r\non leaving her home to proceed to church, to ensure good-luck\r\nto each respectively; and if by stratagem either of the bride's\r\nshoes could be taken off by any spectator on her way from\r\nchurch, it had to be ransomed by the bridegroom.\"\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Kent, the \"luck\" custom of shoe-throwing\r\nis peculiar. After the departure of the bride and bridegroom,\r\nthe single ladies are drawn up in one row, and the bachelors in\r\nanother. An old shoe is then thrown as far as possible, and\r\nthe ladies run for it, the winner, of course, getting the first\r\nchance of being married. She then throws the shoe at the\r\ngentlemen, and the first who gets it will have the same chance.\r\nIn Yorkshire the custom of throwing old shoes was called\r\nthrashing;[*] the older the shoe the better.\r\n\r\nAmong the Peruvians it was formerly a custom that when a\r\nman wished to marry he went to the woman's house, and, with\r\nher father's consent, put on her foot a particular kind of shoe,\r\nin which he led her to his home. If she were a virgin, the\r\nshoe was of wool, if a widow, it was of rush.\r\n\r\nProbably the same principle of wishing good luck was the\r\n\r\n* A forcible application of this meaning is shown in a newspaper report\r\nof a recent negro wedding in North Carolina (1879). Just as the happy\r\npair were leaving in a waggon, an enthusiastic friend owning a very large\r\nfoot, flung his shoe at them with, unfortunately, so good an aim, as to knock\r\nthe bride senseless off her seat. The bridegroom jumped out and punished\r\nthe unlucky thrower with a sound thrashing, and the bride being restored\r\nto consciousness, they set off on their wedding-tour.",
  "p4860.png": "custom in early times of throwing money over the heads of the\r\nbride and bridegroom. There are several instances of this in\r\nthe \"Wardrobe Accounts of Edward II.\" In the tenth year\r\nof that king's reign, money amounting to \u00a32 10s. \"was thrown\r\nover the head of Oliver de Bordeaux and the Lady Maud\r\nTrussel during the solemnization of their nuptials at the door of\r\nthe chapel, within the park at Woodstock, by the king's order.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Berlinese, to ensure good luck to the newly-married\r\npair, advantage is ordinarily taken of the delivery of\r\nsome speech at the wedding breakfast, or the singing of some\r\nsong, to startle the company by a tremendous crash, which sets\r\neverybody laughing, and is the signal for wishing happiness to\r\nthe bride and bridegroom.\r\n\r\nFormerly, in Germany, it was the custom to carry all the old\r\nplates and dishes outside the house door, and break them in\r\nthe street, when if a single one chanced to escape demolition,\r\nit was considered an unlucky omen for the bride. In 1791\r\nLord Malmesbury married a Princess of Prussia, by proxy for\r\nthe Duke of York, and in the morning after the ceremony a\r\ngreat heap of such rubbish was found at the door of her Highness's\r\napartment. In Russia and in other parts of central\r\nEurope it is a custom to throw broken crockery for \"luck\" at\r\nthe doors of newly-married people.\r\n\r\nAt the marriage of King Alfonso of Spain with the Archduchess\r\nChristine of Austria, ladies and children bore wreaths\r\nand bouquets of flowers to throw on the royal carriage for\r\n\"luck,\" after the manner of our showers of rice and slippers.\r\n\r\nSPRINKLING the bride with wheat was a lucky omen.\r\n\r\nHerrick says:\r\n\r\n\"While some repeat\r\nYour praise and bless you, sprinkling you with wheat.\"\r\n\r\nThe custom may be traced to ancient times, as also the employment\r\nof rice as a similar superstition, which is still practised\r\nin our own country as a harmless well-wishing. In foreign",
  "p4870.png": "countries, however, rice forms an important part of the nuptial\r\nceremony. In Persia it is considered an emblem of fruitfulness;\r\nthe Hindoos use it with a formula of prayers. On the\r\nMalabar coast of India, the priest sprinkles the bride and bridegroom\r\nwith rice. Among the Brahmins the bridegroom throws\r\nthree handfuls of rice on the bride's head. In Italy the mother\r\nof a newly-married man, on his arrival at his house for the first\r\ntime with his wife, throws some rice behind the back of the\r\nbride, to warn her that after the wedding festivities, she must\r\ndevote herself to the duties of housewifery.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire and elsewhere in the North of England, the\r\nbride-cake is cut into little square pieces, and then for luck\r\nthrown over the bridegroom's and bride's head, and then put\r\nthrough a ring. The cake is sometimes broken over the bride's\r\nhead, and then thrown away among the crowd to be scrambled\r\nfor. In the East Riding of Yorkshire, a plate, covered with\r\npieces of bride-cake, is thrown among the crowd; should it be\r\nunbroken, the sign is ominous; but, otherwise (which is no\r\ndoubt the usual result), good luck will follow the marriage.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland a currant bun is broken over the head of a bride\r\nbefore entering the house. It is considered very unlucky if the\r\nbun, by mistake, should be broken over the head of any person\r\nother than the bride.\r\n\r\nA curious wedding custom among the Esthonians is to pour\r\na can of beer over the head of the bridegroom's horse, and scatter\r\na handful of rye over the heads of the bridal couple for good\r\nluck's sake.\r\n\r\nFlinging the stocking was an old custom on the bridal eve;\r\nin Fletcher's \"Poems\" (1656), it is thus alluded to:\r\n\r\n\"This clutter ore, Clarinda lay\r\nHalf-bedded, like the peeping day,\r\nBehind Olimpus' cap;\r\nWhiles at her head each twitt'ring girle\r\nThe fatal stocking quick did whirle\r\nTo know the lucky hap.\"\r\n\r\nMisson, in his \"Travels through England,\" explains this\r\nventure for luck as follows: The young men, it seems, took",
  "p4880.png": "the bride's stockings, and the girls those of the bridegroom,\r\neach of whom, sitting at the foot of the bed, threw the stocking\r\nover their heads, endeavouring to make it fall upon that of the\r\nbride or her spouse; if the bridegroom's stockings, thrown by\r\nthe girls, fell upon the bridegroom's head, it was a sign that\r\nthey themselves would soon be married; and similar luck was\r\nderived from the falling of the bride's stockings, thrown by the\r\nyoung men.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire it happens, in some places, that after the married\r\ncouple have driven away, and the old shoe thrown after them\r\nfor luck, the cook comes out with a kettle of hot water, which\r\nshe pours on the stone at the front door, as an auspice there\r\nwould soon be another wedding from the same house. It is\r\ncalled keeping the threshold warm for another bride.\r\n\r\nGOOD luck depended upon a bride not stepping over the\r\nthreshold in entering the bridegroom's house, but being\r\nlifted over by her nearest relations. She was also to knit her\r\nfillets to the doorposts, and anoint the sides to avoid the mischievous\r\nfascination of witches. Previous to this, too, she was\r\nto put on a yellow veil. Herrick, in the \"Hesperides,\" alludes\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n\"And now the yellow vaile at last\r\nOver her fragrant cheek is cast.\r\nYou, you that be of her nearest kin,\r\nNow o'er the threshold force her in.\r\nBut to avert the worst,\r\nLet her, her fillets first\r\nKnit to the posts; this point\r\nRemembering, to anoint\r\nThe sides; for 'tis a charme\r\nStrong against future harme,\r\nAnd the evil deeds, the which\r\nThere was hidden by the witch.\"\r\n\r\nThe same poet, who has written so extensively on our old\r\ncustoms, says with regard to the sack-posset, eaten in the evening\r\nof the wedding-day, just before the company retired:\r\n\r\n\"If needs we must for ceremonie's sake\r\nBlesse a sacke-posset; luck go with it, take\r\nThe night charm quickly; you have spells\r\nAnd magicks for to end.\"",
  "p4890.png": "\r\nA divination by the bean was productive of good luck. A\r\nbean, shell and all, was put into one of the pea-pods; whoever\r\ngot the bean would be first married.\r\n\r\nIt was \"lucky\" for bridesmaids to throw away pins on a\r\nwedding-day. \"Woe,\" says Misson, in his \"Travels,\" \"be to\r\nthe bride if a single one is left about her, nothing will go right.\r\nWoe also to the bridesmaids if they keep one of them, for they\r\nwill not be married before Whitsontide.\"\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, however, the young girls who visit the bridal\r\nchamber secure the pins used in fastening the bride's dress for\r\na lucky marriage.\r\n\r\nRandolph, in his \"Letters,\" writing of the marriage of Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots, to Lord Darnley, says that when the queen,\r\nafter her marriage, went to her chamber to change her clothes,\r\nshe suffered \"them that stood by, every man that could approach,\r\nto take a pin.\"\r\n\r\nIn the North of England it is considered unlucky for a couple\r\nto be married while there is a grave open in the churchyard.\r\nIt is also ominous of misfortune to be married in green.\r\n\r\nThe wearing of orange blossoms at weddings, although a comparatively\r\nmodern custom, is said to be derived from the East,\r\nand as emblems of a prosperous and fruitful marriage, may be\r\nplaced in the category of good luck.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, it was considered unlucky if a bridal\r\nparty on going to church met a priest, hare, dog, cat, lizard, or\r\nserpent; while good luck attended the rencontre with a wolf,\r\nspider, or toad. The sneezing of a cat on the eve of the marriage\r\nday was a lucky omen. It was unlucky for a woman to marry\r\na man whose surname began with the same letter as her own.\r\n\r\nIt is unlucky for a bride to look in the glass after she is completely\r\ndressed before she goes to the church, unless some\r\narticle is put on after her self-approving glances.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, a man going\r\nto be married, on meeting a male acquaintance, rubs his elbow.\r\nWhen a newly married couple first enter their house, a hen is\r\nbrought and made to cackle, as a sign of good luck.",
  "p4900.png": "\r\nAmong the Chinese, while a betrothal is under consideration\r\nfor three days, if anything unlucky should happen in the houses\r\nof the parties concerned, such as the breaking of a bowl, or the\r\nloss of any article, the negotiation for the marriage is postponed\r\nor set aside.\r\n\r\nPennant mentions that among the Highlanders, during the\r\nmarriage ceremony, great care is taken that dogs do not pass\r\nbetween the couple to be married; and particular attention is\r\npaid to leaving the bridegroom's left shoe without buckle or\r\nlatchet, to prevent the secret influence of witches.\r\n\r\nIt was held unlucky, formerly, if the bride did not weep\r\nbitterly on the wedding-day. Bad weather was most unpropitious.\r\nIn a letter from Chamberlain to Dudley Carleton\r\n(1603), he says: \"Mr. Winwood was married on Tuesday, with\r\nmuch thunder and lightning and rain. The ominous weather\r\nand dismal day put together, might have made a superstitious\r\nman startle; but he turned all to the best, and so may it\r\nprove.\"\r\n\r\nGrose mentions a singular superstition, that if, in a family,\r\nthe youngest daughter should chance to be married before her\r\nelder sisters, they must all dance at her wedding without shoes;\r\nthis will counteract their ill-luck, and procure them husbands.\r\n\r\nMr. James Napier gives the following prevalent superstitions\r\nin the West of Scotland, relating to marriage \"luck\" omens.\r\nA clot of soot coming down the chimney and spoiling the\r\nbreakfast; the bride accidentally breaking a dish; a bird sitting\r\non the window-sill chirping for some time; the bird in the\r\ncage dying the morning of the wedding; a dog howling, and\r\nthe postman forgetting to deliver a letter to the bride until he\r\nwas a good way off, and had to return. Some of these were\r\ndefined for good, but most of them were evil omens.\r\n\r\nTo meet a funeral, either in going to or coming from marriage,\r\nwas very unlucky. If the funeral was that of a female,\r\nthe young wife would not live long; if a male, the bridegroom\r\nwould die soon.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Russia it is believed, that if the bride tastes",
  "p4910.png": "the cake on the eve of the wedding, her husband will not love\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt is unlucky for a lady to read the marriage service entirely\r\nthrough; she would never be married.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, it is considered lucky if, at a dinner, an unmarried\r\nperson is placed inadvertently between a married couple,\r\nas he or she will get a partner within the year.\r\n\r\nIn Derbyshire, and in other parts of the country, it is considered\r\nunlucky if the bees are not informed of a wedding, and\r\ntheir hives are decorated with a favour.\r\n\r\nWINTER was considered a lucky season for marriage,\r\nby the ancients. At Athens, the month partly corresponding\r\nto our January received its name, Gamelius, from\r\nmarriages being frequently celebrated in it. Hesiod recommends\r\nmarriage on the fourth day of the month; but whether\r\nthe fourth from the beginning or the end is uncertain. Euripides\r\nspeaks as if the time of the full moon was favourable.\r\nProclus tells us that the Athenians selected for marriages the\r\ntimes of a new moon: that is, when the sun and moon were in\r\nconjunction.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable peculiarity in the Scottish people, says\r\nthe Registrar-General--their fondness for marrying on the last\r\nday of the year. There are more marriages in Scotland on that\r\nday, than in any week of the year, excepting, of course, the\r\nweek in which that day occurs. The detailed returns for 1861\r\ngive the number of marriages in the eight principal towns, as\r\naveraging some twenty-five a day, that is to say, a work-day,\r\nfor marrying is one of the things not to be done in Scotland on\r\nSunday; but the Registrar-General states that, in fact, there\r\nare between 400 and 500 marriages in those towns on December\r\n31. By another curious usage, a large proportion of these\r\nmarriages are not registered until January, making that appear a\r\nfavourable month for marriage, which it is not.\r\n\r\nThe Registrar-General, in one of his reports, says: \"Seamen\r\nwill not sail, women will not wed on a Friday, so willingly as on",
  "p4920.png": "other days of the week.\" Out of 4,057 marriages in the midland\r\ndistricts of England, not 2 per cent. were celebrated on\r\nFriday, while 32 per cent. were entered into on Sunday. The\r\nnext in favour was Monday with 21 per cent. then Saturday\r\nwith 17 per cent. Mr. Watson, the City Chamberlain of Glasgow,\r\nsays: \"It is a well-established fact, that nine-tenths of the\r\nmarriages in Glasgow are celebrated on Friday; only a few on\r\nTuesday and Wednesday; Saturday and Monday are still more\r\nrarely adopted, and I have never heard of such a thing in\r\nGlasgow as a marriage on Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nSo that in Scotland, Friday is the lucky day of the week for\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\nSunday was considered an auspicious day for weddings in\r\nShakspeare's time; thus we have in the \"Taming of the\r\nShrew:\"\r\n\r\n\"We will have rings, and things, and fine array;\r\nAnd, kiss me, Kate, we will be married o' Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Bulgarians, Wednesday or Thursday evenings are\r\nconsidered most propitious for weddings.\r\n\r\nA Russian who thinks that the time has come to take a\r\nwife, will put a turquoise ring into his pocket on Whitsun Day,\r\nand go into the Summer Park (at St. Petersburg), determined\r\nto bestow this trinket on somebody before the day is over, but\r\nhaving no idea when he sets out as to who the fortunate\r\nrecipient will be.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, Easter engagements are said to bring money;\r\nthose at Ascension, health; those at Trinity, a numerous progeny;\r\nand those at Whitsuntide, peace in the domestic circle\r\n(a species of \"good luck\" that all must devoutly wish for);\r\ncautious folks who hold by superstitions have, naturally, an\r\ninclination for these last.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, a lucky day is always selected for a marriage; so\r\nin China, where weddings are prohibited at certain times and\r\nseasons, on account of their being unpropitious. On the occasion\r\nof the bride trying on her clothes, and worshipping the\r\nancestral tablets of her family, it is considered unlucky if any of",
  "p4930.png": "her female relatives and friends are present in mourning. The\r\nBrahmins are excessively superstitious in their marriages. If a\r\nman goes to demand a woman in marriage for his son, should\r\nanything unlucky occur on his way, the visit is postponed; to\r\nhear a serpent named is bad enough, but to see one puts marriage\r\nout of the question. A lucky day for weddings is essential.\r\nIn India, a rainy day is considered very unlucky for marriage.\r\nThe Veisyas test the prospects of a proposed union by melting\r\ndown a gold coin; should the metal appear of a shining\r\ncharacter, it is a lucky omen; but if it be dull, the marriage\r\nis broken off. The Moslems attach good luck to marriages\r\ncelebrated on the eve of Friday--the Moslem sabbath.\r\nIn Russian weddings, the day is selected by a fortune-teller. In\r\nSweden, formerly, the bridegroom would not, on his wedding-day,\r\nstand near a closed gate, or where cross-roads met, for\r\nfear of ill-luck. Both in Sweden and Norway, Thursday was\r\nlooked upon as a Pagan day (the day of Thor), and no weddings\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nAmong the people in the Cochin State, care is taken to\r\nchoose a \"lucky\" day for the marriage; whilst in the \"unlucky\"\r\nmonths, espousals may be said to be almost prohibited.\r\nAlso \"on the third day of the new moon, as Adam was then\r\nexpelled from Paradise; on the fifth, when Jonah was swallowed\r\nby a whale; on the thirteenth, when Abraham was\r\nthrown into the fire; on the sixteenth, when Joseph was\r\nlowered into a well; on the twenty-first, when Job was afflicted\r\nwith diseases; on the twenty-fourth, when Zachariah was\r\nmurdered; on the twenty-fifth, when Mahomed had his front\r\nteeth broken by a sling.\" Marriages are mostly celebrated in\r\nJanuary, April, August, October, and November, excluding\r\nall the days having bad omens, as enumerated.\r\n\r\nTHERE is no superstition, it has been observed, however\r\nharmless it may appear, and may indeed long continue\r\nto be, but has in it some latent evil. Much has arisen from\r\nthe distinction of unlucky days, which may very innocently and",
  "p4940.png": "naturally have originated, though it was afterwards dexterously\r\napplied by astrologers, and by the priests of false religions, to\r\ntheir own purpose. No one would willingly commence an\r\nimportant undertaking on the anniversary of a day which had\r\nbrought to him some great and irreparable calamity.\r\n\r\nHesiod says:\r\n\r\n\"These are the days of which the careful heed.\r\nEach human enterprize will, favouring, speed;\r\nOthers there are, which intermediate fall,\r\nMark'd with no auspice, and unomen'd all:\r\nAnd these will some, and those will others praise;\r\nBut few are vers'd in mysteries of days.\r\nNow as a step-mother the day we find\r\nSevere, and now as is a mother kind.\"\r\n\r\nFrom ancient Egypt, the evil, or unlucky days have received\r\nthe name of \"Egyptian days.\" A Saxon MS. (Cott. MS. Vitel,\r\nc. viii. fo. 20) gives the following account of these Dies Mali:\r\n\"Three days there are in the year, which we call Egyptian\r\ndays, that is, in our language, dangerous days, on any occasion\r\nwhatever, to the blood of man or beast. In the month which\r\nwe call April, the last Monday; and then is the second, at the\r\ncoming in of the month we call August; then is the third,\r\nwhich is the first Monday of the going out of the month of\r\nDecember. He who on these three days reduces blood, be it\r\nof man, be it of beast, this we have heard say, that speedily on\r\nthe first or seventh day, his life he will end. Or if his life be\r\nshorter, so that he come not to the seventh day, or if he drink\r\nsome time in these three days, he will end his life; and he\r\nthat tastes of goose-flesh, within forty days' space, his life he\r\nwill end.\"\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Exeter Calendar, a MS. said to be of the age\r\nof Henry II., the first or Kalends of January is set down as\r\n\"Dies Mala.\" These Saxon calendars give us a total of about\r\ntwenty-four evil days in the 365, or about one such in every\r\nfifteen. But as the superstition \"lengthened the cords and\r\nstrengthened its stakes,\" it seems to have been felt or feared\r\nthat the black days had too small a hold on their regarders, so",
  "p4950.png": "they were multiplied. In the \"Book of Knowledge\" we read,\r\n\"Astronomers say that six days of the year are perilous of\r\ndeath: and therefore they forbid men to let blood on them, or\r\ntake any drink; that is to say, Jan. 3, July 1, Oct. 2, the last\r\nof April, Aug. 1, the last day going out of December. These\r\nsix days with great diligence ought to be kept, but chiefly the\r\nlatter three, for all the veins are then full. For then, whether\r\nman or beast be knit in them within seven days, or certainly\r\nwithin fourteen days, he shall die. And if they take any drinks\r\nwithin fifteen days, they shall die; and if they eat any goose in\r\nthese three days, within forty days they shall die; and if any\r\nchild be born in these three latter days, they shall die a wicked\r\ndeath. Astronomers and astrologers say that in the beginning\r\nof March, the seventh night, or the fourteenth day, let the blood\r\nof the right arm; and in the beginning of April, the eleventh\r\nday, of the left arm; and in the end of May, third or fifth day,\r\non whether arm thou wilt; and thus, of all the year, thou shalt\r\norderly be kept from the fever, the falling gout, the sister gout,\r\nand the loss of thy sight.\"\r\n\r\nA \"Book of Presidents\" (precedents), published in 1616,\r\ncontains a calendar, many of the days in which have the letter\r\nB affixed, \"which signifyeth such dayes as the Egyptians note\r\nto be dangerous to begin or take anything in hand, or to take\r\na journey or such like thing.\" The days thus marked are,\r\nJanuary 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 17, 19; February 7, 10, 17, 27, 28;\r\nMarch 15, 16, 28; April 7, 10, 16, 20, 21; May 7, 15, 20;\r\nJune 4, 10, 22; July 15, 20; August 1, 19, 20, 29, 30; September\r\n3, 4, 6, 7, 21, 22; October 4, 16, 24; November, 5, 6,\r\n28, 29; December 6, 7, 9, 15, 17, 22.\r\n\r\nIn a sermon of St. Eloy (circa 640), he says: \"Let no one\r\nkeep Thursday as a holy day, either in May or at any other\r\ntime (unless it be some saint's day), or the day of moths and\r\nmice, or any day of any kind, but the Lord's day.\"\r\n\r\nBourne, speaking of the superstitious custom of the heathens,\r\nobserving one day as good, and another as bad, observes, \"That\r\namong these were lucky and unlucky days; some were Dies",
  "p4960.png": "Atri, and some Dies Albi. The Atri were pointed out in their\r\ncalendar with a black character, the Albi with a white; the\r\nformer to denote it a day of bad success, the latter a day of\r\ngood. Thus have the monks, in the dark and unlearned ages\r\nof Popery, copy'd after the heathens, and dream'd themselves\r\ninto the like superstitions, esteeming one day more successful\r\nthan another.\" He tells us, also, that St. Austin, upon the\r\npassage of St. Paul to the Galatians, against observing days,\r\nand months, and times, and years, explains it to have this\r\nmeaning: \"The persons the Apostle blames are those who say, I\r\nwill not set forward on my journey, because it is the next day\r\nafter such a time, or because the moon is so; or I'll set forward\r\nthat I may have luck, because such is just now the position of\r\nthe stars. I will not traffic this month because such a star presides;\r\nor I will, because it does. I shall plant no vines this\r\nyear because it is leap-year,\" etc. Barnaby Googe thus translates\r\nthe remarks of Naogeorgius on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"And first, betwixt the dayes they make no little difference,\r\nFor all be not of vertue like, nor like preheminence,\r\nBut some of them Egyptian are, and full of jeopardee.\r\nAnd some againe, beside the rest, both good and luckie bee.\r\nLike difference of the nights they make, as if the Almightie King\r\nThat made them all, not gracious were to them in everything.\"\r\n\r\nIn an old MS. on this subject, mention is made of certain\r\ndays: \"Y^t be observed by some old writers, chiefly the curious\r\nastrologians, who did alledge y^t there were 28 days in the yeare,\r\nwhich were revealed by the angel Gabriel to good Joseph, which\r\never have been remarked to be very fortunate dayes either to\r\npurge, to let bloud, cure wounds, use marchandizes, sow seed,\r\nplant trees, build houses, or take journies, in long or short\r\nvoyages, in fighting or giving of bataille, or skirmishing. They\r\nalso doe alledge that children who were borne in any of these\r\ndayes could never be poore; and all children who were put to\r\nschooles, or colledges, in those dayes, should become great\r\nschollars, and those who were put to any crafte or trade in\r\nthose dayes should become perfect Artificers and rich, and",

It is considered unlucky to go anywhere on the day\r\nthat they hear of the death of a friend.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire, Tuesday and Wednesday are considered lucky\r\ndays; Thursday has one lucky hour, viz., the hour before the\r\nsun rises.

These\r\nwere called geasa. They are enumerated in the old Celtic\r\nbooks. For instance, the King of Ireland was not to allow the\r\nsun to rise upon him in his bed at Tara. He was prohibited\r\nfrom alighting from his horse on a Wednesday in Magh Breagh\r\n(Bregia), or from crossing Magh Cuillin after sundown. He\r\nwas not allowed to set out on an expedition against North Teffia\r\non a Tuesday, or to go in a ship on the water the Monday after\r\nBealltaine (May Day), or to leave the track of his army at a\r\ncertain place on the Tuesday after Samtrain (All Hallows).\r\nThe King of Leinster was not suffered to travel the road to\r\nDublin on a Monday; and it was considered extremely unlucky\r\nfor him to ride across Magh Maistean (Mullaghmast). The\r\nKing of Munster was prohibited from enjoying a feast at\r\nKillarney from one Monday to another. No doubt some king\r\nhad suffered from a week's carouse at the Lakes. The King\r\nof Connaught was not to wear a speckled garment, nor to ride\r\na speckled horse at a certain place, on account of ill-luck; and\r\nthe King of Ulster was shut out of a large district in his\r\ndominions during the month of March, from a similar consideration.\r\nThese were geasa that applied only to the kings.\r\nThere were, however, a great many days of the year which were\r\nlooked upon as cross, or unlucky days by everyone.

Monday is the most fortunate day to set out\r\non an expedition, mount a new steed, elephant, or carriage.\r\nThe animals are supposed to imbibe a portion of the prevailing\r\ndeity of that day; whereas to mount them, or commence a\r\njourney on Saturday, would incur the probable hazard of a\r\nhorse or elephant proving a sluggard, and the wheel conveyance\r\nbreaking down, and of never reaching the journey's end, whilst\r\nfettered by the influence of the tardy orbit of Sunee, or\r\nSaturn.[*]\r\n\r\nOther days are stamped as auspicious, or the contrary, as the\r\nfull or new moon may fall on particular days of the week,\r\ndetermined by similar astrological tests. The s\u00fal, or trident\r\nof Mahadeo, is considered as in a state of continual motion over\r\nthe earth to guard and preserve its creatures, and to oppose its\r\ndirection, that is its points, would be facing certain death or\r\ndisaster. With reference to its movements, therefore, it is\r\nunlucky to travel to the westward on Sunday and Friday; to\r\nthe northward on Tuesday and Wednesday; to the eastward on\r\nSaturday or Monday; and to the southward on Thursday.\r\n\r\nTuesday brings luck in battle; forges are also set to work,\r\n\r\n* Great disasters were often attributed to the planet Saturn, of malign\r\ninfluence.

He particularly\r\nnotices the 3rd of November, because it was his own birthday;\r\nand also, he had observed some remarkable accidents to",
  "p5100.png": "have happened thereupon. As one instance, he relates: \"I had\r\nan estate left me in Kent, of which between thirty and forty\r\nacres was marsh-land, very conveniently flanking its upland;\r\nand in those days this marsh-land was usually let for four nobles\r\nan acre. My father died 1643. Within a year and a half after\r\nhis decease, such charges and water-schots came upon this\r\nmarsh-land by the influence of the sea, that it was never worth\r\none farthing to me, but very often eat into the rents of the uplands;\r\nso that I often think, this day being my birthday, hath\r\nthe same evil influence upon me that it had 580 years since\r\nupon Earl Godwin, and others concerned in low-lands.\"\r\n\r\nA CORRESPONDENT of \"Notes and Queries\" remarks,\r\nthat the old superstition of ill-luck, if any other than\r\na male person crossed the threshold of a house on New Year's\r\nmorning, is still rife in Worcestershire, where a band of boys go\r\nout early to people's houses, knocking up some of the inmates,\r\nand then entering the dwellings. For this service they receive\r\na trifling consideration from the believers in luck. A farmer's\r\ndaughter mentioned that the orthodox plan was for man or\r\nboy to enter at the back-door, go through the rooms on the\r\nground-floor, and go out by the front-door. If it should happen\r\nthat the family were out at any merry-making on New Year's\r\nEve, and did not return home until the morning, then it would\r\nbe necessary, to ensure luck in the ensuing year, that a strange\r\nman or boy (not one of the family) should open the front-door\r\nand let the party in.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the superstition that is connected with\r\nthis practice, a story is told of a poor old bedridden woman,\r\nwho positively refused to allow her neighbour, who usually\r\nlooked after her, to come in on New Year's Day, but lay breakfastless\r\nand fireless until the middle of the day, when fortunately\r\nthe clergyman came to see her, who, being dark-haired,\r\nbrought as she thought good luck.\r\n\r\nIn most of the villages in Worcestershire and Herefordshire,\r\nthis superstition prevails. In the old climbing-boy days,",
  "p5110.png": "chimneys used to be swept on New Year's morning, so that one\r\nof the right sex might be the first to enter. At some of the\r\nfarmhouses, should washing-day chance to fall on the first day\r\nof the year, it is either put off, or to make sure, the waggoner's\r\nlad is called up early before the women can come, that he may\r\nbe let out and let in again. In some parts of Cornwall, to ensure\r\nthat a male should be the first to enter the house, it was\r\nformerly customary to give boys a small gratuity for placing\r\nsand on the doorsteps and in the passage. Hence bands of\r\nboys would go from house to house, collecting their \"fees for\r\nsanding your steps for good luck.\"\r\n\r\nCurious to say, at Preston it is considered lucky for a fair-haired\r\nman to be the first foot; whereas at Blackburn, which is\r\nonly ten miles distant, the prepossession is in favour of a dark\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIn some parts it is necessary that the first foot should be a\r\nbachelor; and there is an amusing anecdote in \"Notes and\r\nQueries,\" how the father of a family, a farmer living in the\r\nMidland Counties, coming home early one New Year's Day,\r\nwas refused admittance to his own house by the strong-minded\r\ndaughter, because, being red-haired and a widower, he unfortunately\r\nfailed to fulfil two of the most important conditions;\r\nwhile some poor old maids, who had no mankind belonging to\r\nthem, were forced to content themselves with admitting the old\r\ntom-cat, who, luckily for them, was of the right colour if\r\nnothing else. In many places it is considered extra lucky if\r\nthe first foot bring with him either a loaf or a piece of bread,\r\nthis being regarded as an emblem of the plenty to be enjoyed\r\nby the occupants of the house during the forthcoming year.\r\n\r\nThe Christian name of the first foot is, also, of importance,\r\nfor there is a quaint notion that the Christian name of the first\r\nperson you see of the opposite sex on New Year's Day will be\r\nthe name of your future husband or wife. Hence it is related\r\nthat a certain maid-servant in a rectory in the West of England\r\nlocked the man-servant, whose name was Obadiah, in his room,\r\nfor fear they all should be destined to become \"Mrs. Obadiahs,\"",
  "p5120.png": "for, as one remarked, it would not have mattered had his name\r\nbeen John or Henry, as there are plenty of Johns and Henrys\r\nin the world, but who has ever heard of Mrs. Obadiah?\r\n\r\nIn Nottinghamshire it is considered unlucky to remove anything\r\nfrom a house until something has been brought in, and,\r\ntherefore, early in the morning each member of the family\r\ncarries some trifling thing in. Brand alludes to this custom as\r\nexisting in Lincoln and its neighbourhood, and quotes a rhyme\r\nused on the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire it is believed to be particularly unlucky to\r\nwash clothes on New Year's Day, because, by so doing, it is\r\nthought that a member of the family will be rendered liable to\r\nbe washed away out of existence before the close of the year.\r\nThis superstition is carried so far by some persons that they\r\nwill not even permit any dishes, plates, etc., to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nIn Coventry, if not in other places, it is customary to ensure\r\ngood luck by eating a sort of cake, known by the name of god-*cakes.\r\nThey are used by all classes, and vary in prices from\r\none half-penny to silver. They are invariably made in a\r\ntriangular shape, about an inch thick, and filled with a kind of\r\nmince-meat.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire, if any householder's fire does not burn through\r\nthe night of New Year's Eve, it betokens bad luck during the\r\nensuing year; and if any party allowed another a live coal, or\r\neven a lighted candle, on such an occasion, the bad luck would\r\nbe extended to the other party for commiserating with the\r\nformer in his misfortunes.[*]\r\n\r\nThiers, in his \"Histoire des Superstitions\" (1741), gives\r\nsome instances of luck relating to Christmas and New Year's\r\ntime, in France. To bathe on Christmas Day (or Ash Wednes-*\r\n\r\n* In the Bradford Times (January, 1870), we read that a man named\r\nWilliam Pollard was summoned before the magistrates for breaking a pane\r\nof glass in a window at Tong. It seems that he had gone into the house at\r\nChristmas, and asked for a light to his candle. It being a common superstition\r\nthat to allow anyone to take out a light at Christmas is unlucky, the\r\nwoman of the house objected, but offered the man a few matches. He\r\nthen created a disturbance, during which he broke a window.",
  "p5130.png": "*day) will secure freedom from fevers and toothache. It is\r\nunlucky not to lend anything on New Year's Day. It is a custom\r\nto take twelve grains of corn on Christmas Day and to\r\ngive to each the name of the twelve months; these are placed\r\nafterwards on a shovel slightly heated, beginning with that\r\nwhich bears the name of the month of January, and continuing\r\nto do the same with the rest; and when there is one that jumps\r\non the shovel, to feel certain that the corn will be dear in\r\nthat month; but, on the contrary, it will be cheap when the\r\ngrains do not jump. There is (observes M. Thiers) a double\r\nsuperstition in this proceeding; first, because it is intended\r\nto divine in an undue manner; and next, that the practice\r\nis attached to Christmas Day rather than to any other day.\r\nTo bake bread between the Nativity of our Lord and the\r\nCircumcision is unlucky, and would bring misfortune to a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England it is considered unlucky to receive\r\nshoes or tanned leather in the Christmas week. A small\r\nHerefordshire farmer made lamentation that a pair of new shoes\r\nhad been, unwittingly, received into his house on Christmas\r\nmorning, and said it was a bad job, for \"he lost a sight of\r\ncattle that year.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unlucky to bring holly into a house before Christmas\r\nEve.\r\n\r\nIn Hampshire, Derbyshire, and other parts of England, it.\r\nwas considered \"lucky\" to take the last bit of the yule-log\r\nfrom the fire and hang it the next day close to the ceiling in\r\nthe kitchen, to be kept for the purpose of lighting the next year's\r\nChristmas Eve fire, or rather for putting upon the fire before\r\nthe new yule-long was put on. Besides being lucky, it was a\r\ncharm against fire. Care was always taken not to let the log\r\nburn entirely away. Before this could take place the remnant\r\nwould be taken from the fire and put on the hob while the fire\r\ndied out, and if it was not considered late enough to go to bed,\r\nanother log was added.\r\n\r\nHerrick writes, on \"The Ceremonies of Candlemas Day:\"",
  "p5140.png": "\r\n\"Kindle the Christmas brand, and then\r\nTill sunset let it burn;\r\nWhich quench'd, then lay it up again\r\nTill Christmas next return.\r\nPan must be kept, wherewith to tend\r\nThe Christmas log next year,\r\nAnd where it is safely kept, the fiend\r\nCan do no mischief there.\"\r\n\r\nThe Venetians say that on New Year's Day you must notice\r\nwhom you meet when you first go out. To meet a man is good\r\nluck; a woman, bad luck. If you meet a priest you will die\r\nwithin the year; a policeman, you will have litigation.\r\n\r\nBOURNE, in his \"Antiquitates Vulgares,\" remarking on\r\nthe superstitious custom of the heathens in observing\r\none day as lucky and another the reverse, says: \"Thus have\r\nthe monks in the dark and unlearned ages of popery copied\r\nafter the heathens, and dreamed themselves into the like superstitions,\r\nesteemed one day more successful than another, and\r\nso according to them it is very unlucky to begin any work on\r\nChildermas Day, and what day soever that falls on, whether on\r\na Monday, Tuesday, or any other, nothing must be done on\r\nthat day through the year; St. Paul's Day is the year's fortune-*teller;\r\nSt. Mark's Day is the prognosticator of your life and\r\ndeath, etc., and so, instead of persuading the people to lay\r\naside the whims and fancies of the heathen world, they brought\r\nthem so effectually in that they are still reigning in many places\r\nto this day.\"\r\n\r\nMelton, in his \"Astrologaster,\" remarks it was formerly an\r\narticle in the creed of popular superstition, that it was \"unlucky\"\r\nto put on a new suit, pare one's nails, or begin anything on a\r\nChildermas Day.\r\n\r\nAddison, in the Spectator (No. 7), alludes to this superstition\r\nin a credulous family: \"As they began to talk of family\r\naffairs, a little boy at the lower end of the table told her\r\n(his mother) that he was going into join-hand on Thursday.\r\n'Thursday!' says she; 'no, child, if it please God you shall not",
  "p5150.png": "begin on Childermas Day; tell your writing-master that Friday\r\nwill be soon enough.'\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from Fenn's letters that on account of Childermas,\r\nor Holy Innocents' Day, the coronation of Edward IV. was\r\nput off till the Monday, because the preceding Sunday was\r\nChildermas Day.\r\n\r\nComines, in his \"Life of Louis XI.,\" states that the king\r\nwould be very angry with those about him if they troubled him\r\nwith any matter on Candlemas Day.\r\n\r\nHerrick says, on \"Candlemas Eve:\"\r\n\r\n\"Down with the rosemary, and so\r\nDown with the bays and mistletoe:\r\nDown with the holly, ivy, all\r\nWherewith ye dressed the Christmas hall;\r\nThat so the superstitious find\r\nNo one least branch there left behind;\r\nFor look, how many leaves there be\r\nNeglected there, maids, trust to me,\r\nSo many goblins ye shall see.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unlucky not to eat goose at Michaelmas; omitting this,\r\nthere is a risk of wanting money all that year.\r\n\r\nIt is lucky to keep mince-meat from Christmas to Easter.\r\n\r\nGay, in his \"Shepherd's Week\" (Pastoral iv.), says in allusion\r\nto Valentines Day:\r\n\r\n\"A-field I went, amid the morning dew,\r\nTo milk my kine (for so should housewives do):\r\nThee first I spy'd; and the first swain we see,\r\nIn spite of fortune shall our true love be.\"\r\n\r\nIT was considered unlucky for a servant to enter a new place\r\non Friday. In many country districts, especially in the\r\nNorth of England, no weddings take place on Friday from this\r\ncause. According to a rhyming proverb Friday's moon, come\r\nwhen it will, comes too soon.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Overbury, in his sketch of a milkmaid, says:\r\n\"Her dreams are so chaste, that she dare tell them; only a\r\nFriday's dream is all her superstition; and she consents for\r\nfear of anger.\"\r\n\r\nErasmus dwells on the \"extraordinary inconsistency\" of the",
  "p5160.png": "English of his day in eating flesh in Lent, yet holding it an\r\nheinous offence to eat any on a Friday out of Lent.\r\n\r\nAmong the Brahmins of India there is a similar aversion to\r\nFriday; they say that no business should be commenced on\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards hold Friday to be a very unlucky day, and\r\nnever undertake anything of consequence upon it. Among the\r\nFinns, anyone who transacts business on Monday or Friday\r\nwill have ill-luck.\r\n\r\nFrom Eradut Khan's \"Memoirs of the Mogul Empire,\" it\r\nappears, however, that Friday was there considered in a different\r\nlight. \"On Friday, the 28th of Zekand, his majesty (Aurungzebe)\r\nperformed his morning devotions in company with his\r\nattendants; after which, as was frequently his custom, he exclaimed,\r\n'O that my death may happen on a Friday, for blessed\r\nis he who dieth on that day.'\"\r\n\r\nFynes Moryson, in his \"Itinerary,\" speaking of the King of\r\nPoland, at the port of Dantzic in 1593, says: \"The next day\r\nthe king had a good wind, but before this (as those of the\r\nRomish religion are very superstitious) the king and the queen\r\n(being of the house of Austria), while sometimes they thought\r\nMonday, sometimes Friday, to be unlucky days, had lost many\r\nfair winds.\"\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts of Lancashire a man going to court his\r\nsweetheart on Friday, was subjected to rude treatment by his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nA Russian traveller will not start on his journey on either a\r\nMonday or a Friday.\r\n\r\nTo wear green on Friday, such as emeralds, etc., is considered\r\nlucky.\r\n\r\nScott, in \"Marmion,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"The Highlander....\r\nWill, on a Friday morn, look pale\r\nIf ask'd to tell a fairy tale.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scotch fairies, \"the men of peace,\" were particularly\r\noffended at mortals who talked of them, or who wore their",
  "p5170.png": "favourite colour, green. This was especially to be avoided on\r\nFriday, when, whether as dedicated to Venus, with whom in\r\nGermany this subterraneous people are held nearly connected,\r\nor for a more solemn reason, they are more active and possessed\r\nof greater power.\r\n\r\nM. Minard, a statistician, says that Friday is considered such\r\nan unlucky day in France, that not only is the number of\r\ntravellers by rail much smaller than that on other days, but the\r\ndifference is also sensibly felt in the receipts of the omnibuses.\r\n\r\nA Frenchwoman exclaiming, on the birth of the Count de\r\nChambord (Sept. 30, 1820), that it was a pity the prince should\r\nhave been born on a Friday, another woman observed: \"There\r\nis no longer a Friday for the Royalists; this one brings ill-luck\r\nonly to the Jacobins!\"\r\n\r\nIn France it is considered unlucky to cut one's nails on any\r\nday which has an r in its name: vis., on Mardi, Mercredi, or\r\nVendredi. In Holland the case is quite different, and cutting\r\nthe nails on Friday secures protection from toothache.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. of France considered Friday lucky, and began\r\nhis undertakings by preference on that day.\r\n\r\nGood Friday and Easter Sunday were considered lucky days\r\nfor changing the caps of children. According to an old rhyme\r\ngood or ill luck depended upon the following days:\r\n\r\n\"Monday for wealth,\r\nTuesday for health,\r\nWednesday the best day of all:\r\nThursday for crosses,\r\nFriday for losses,\r\nSaturday no luck at all.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the date 1831, a writer in \"Hone's Year Book\" says:[** unclear]\r\n\"There are still a few respectable tradesmen and merchants who\r\nwill not transact business, or be bled, or take physic on a\r\nFriday, because it is an unlucky day. There are other people\r\nwho for the same reason will not be married on a Friday;\r\nothers, again, who consider every child born on that day\r\ndoomed to misfortune.",

Soon after his\r\narrival at Pisa, a lady of his acquaintance happening to meet\r\nhim on the road from her house, as she was herself returning\r\nthither, and supposing that he had been to make her a visit,\r\nrequested that he would go back with her. \"I have not been\r\nto your house,\" he answered, \"for just before I got to the door,\r\nI remembered that it was Friday; and not liking to make my\r\nfirst visit on a Friday, I turned back.\" Moore states that it is\r\neven related he once sent away a Genoese tailor who brought\r\nhim home a new coat on the same ominous day. With all\r\nthis, strange to say, he set sail for Greece on a Friday; and\r\nthough by those who have any leaning to this superstitious\r\nfancy, the result may be thought but too sadly confirmatory of\r\nthe omen, it is plain that either the influence of the superstition\r\nover his own mind was slight, or in the excitement of self-devotion\r\nunder which he then acted, was forgotten.\r\n\r\nAmong old sayings we find: \"he that sings on Friday shall\r\nweep on Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friday's hair and Sunday's horn,\r\nGoes to the Evil One Monday morn.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Americans, if Friday was ever ill-omened,\r\nits reputation is sufficiently redeemed; for it was on that day\r\nColumbus discovered the American Continent, that George\r\nWashington was born, and that the Pilgrim Fathers reached\r\nthe Plymouth Rock.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of Friday being considered by some as a day\r\nof good luck, Gibbon, the eccentric author of \"Some Memorable\r\nRemarques upon the Fourteenth of October,\" prints the\r\nfollowing epistle to himself. It is a curious instance of Friday\r\nsuperstition: \"A Letter from Sir Winston Churchil, Knight;\r\nFather to the Right Honorable John, Lord Churchil. I Thank\r\nyou for your kind Present, the Observation of the Fatality of\r\nDays. I have made great Experience of the Truth of it; and\r\nhave set down Fryday as my own Lucky Day; the Day on",

After drawing the cheque, I turned\r\nround to give it to Wills (\u00a31,790), and said: 'Now isn't\r\nit an extraordinary thing--look at the day--Friday! I have\r\nbeen nearly drawing it half a dozen times, when the lawyers\r\nhave not been ready, and here it comes round upon a Friday,\r\nas a matter of course.\"\r\n\r\nDickens, it seems, frequently remarked that all the important,\r\nand so far fortunate events of his life, had happened to him on\r\na Friday. Contrary to the usual superstition, that day had\r\ncome to be looked upon by his family as his \"lucky\" day.\r\n\r\nMELTON, in his \"Astrologaster,\" tells us: \"That it is a\r\ngreat signe of ill-lucke, if rats gnaw a man's clothes.\"\r\nNo doubt, if he can ill afford to pay his tailor for mending\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSt. Austin (quoted by Bingham) says: \"Cato gave a wise\r\nand smart answer to such an one who came in some consternation\r\nto consult him about the rats gnawing his stockings; 'That,'\r\nsaid he, 'is no great wonder, but it would have been a wonder\r\nindeed, if the stockings had gnawed the rats.'\"\r\n\r\nGrose says: \"It is held extremely unlucky to kill a cricket;\r\nprobably from the idea of its being a breach of hospitality, this\r\ninsect taking refuge in houses.\" Pliny mentions the cricket as\r\nbeing much esteemed by the ancient magicians.

There are various allusions to this in the old\r\nwriters. In Ellison's \"Trip to Benwell,\" we find:\r\n\r\n\"Nor did we meet, with nimble feet,\r\nOne little fearful Lepus,\r\nThat certain sign, as some divine\r\nOf fortune bad to keep us.\"\r\n\r\nHoveden, in his \"Chronicles,\" mentions as a lucky omen,\r\nthat Henry II. of England when invading Ireland (1171), on\r\nlanding, a white hare was seen to jump out of a neighbouring\r\nhedge. The animal was caught immediately, says the chronicler,\r\nand presented to the king \"in signum victori\u00e6.\"\r\n\r\nTo the superstition of fishermen regarding the white hare, I\r\nhave alluded in the chapter on \"The Sea and Seamen.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that swine appearing on the way, betokened good\r\nluck; if a sow is with her litter of pigs, it is lucky, and denotes\r\na successful journey.\r\n\r\nIll-luck betided those who met early in the morning an ill-favoured\r\nman or woman, a rough-footed hen, a shag-haired dog, or\r\na black cat.\r\n\r\nShaw, in his \"History of Moray,\" states that the ancient\r\nScots, if they saw a deer, fox, or any \"beast of game,\" and they\r\ndid not kill it, the omen was unlucky. There were no laws\r\nagainst poaching in those times.\r\n\r\n\"The tail of a lizard in your shoe procures money and good\r\nluck,\" was a common saying in France. Salgues, in his\r\n\"Erreurs et Pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s,\" says: \"Combien de fois moi-m\u00eame, sot\r\net malin \u00e9colier, n'ai-je pas coup\u00e9 des queues de l\u00e9zard, pour\r\nme mettre en garde contre les coups de la fortune, ou la f\u00e9rule\r\nde mon r\u00e9gent.\"\r\n\r\nIt is believed a sign of \"bad luck\" to meet a white horse, un-*",

To see dead\r\nhorses signifies a lucky event.\r\n\r\nIn the Lincoln and Stamford Mercury (1879), we have a\r\ncurious instance of the superstition of rooks going away being a\r\nsign of bad luck: \"A singular circumstance is reported in\r\nconnection with the recent death of Mr. Graves, of Linwood\r\nGrange. Near the house a colony of rooks had established\r\nthemselves, and on the day of the funeral, immediately on the\r\nappearance of the hearse, the birds left the locality in a body,\r\ndeserting their nests, all of which contained young. A few only\r\nhave returned.\"\r\n\r\nBees must not be given away, but sold, otherwise neither the\r\ngiver nor the taker will have luck. To follow bees betokens\r\ngain, or profit. Bees were to be informed of the death of one\r\nin a family, or they would desert the hive; in some counties a\r\nblack crape was put round the hive, or on a small stick by its side.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, if a person who kept bees had his hives robbed,\r\nhe gave them up immediately, because they never could succeed\r\nafterwards. This idea rises from an old Breton proverb, which\r\nsays, \"No luck after the robber.\" But why the whole weight\r\nof the proverb was made to fall upon the bee-hives is difficult\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\nKilling a spider is considered unlucky; but it has been\r\nobserved that this notion serves in many instances, among the\r\nvulgar, as an apology for the laziness of housewives in not\r\ndestroying their cobwebs. Small spiders, termed \"money-spinners,\"\r\nindicated good luck, if not destroyed or injured, or\r\nremoved from the person on whom they were seen. Old\r\nFuller says, \"The moral is this; such as imitate the industry\r\nof that contemptible creature may, by God's blessing, weave\r\nthemselves into wealth and procure a plentiful estate.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Esthonians build a house they lay herbs and\r\nleaves on the ground to attract the ants.

Bartholomew\r\nSimmons based a ballad upon it, \"The Doom of the Mirror,\"\r\nwhich is included in the Irish ballad poetry. The origin, as\r\nwell as the antiquity of such belief, is indicated by an Irish\r\ncanon of a collection attributed to St. Patrick, which excommunicates\r\nthe Christian \" qui crediderit esse Lamiam in\r\nspeculo, qu\u00e6 interpretatur Striga.\"\r\n\r\n\"So with the old superstition,\" remarks Mr. Proctor, in his\r\n\"Borderland of Science,\" \"that a broken mirror brings seven\r\nyears of sorrow, which, according to some, dates from the time\r\nwhen a mirror was so costly as to represent seven years' savings,\r\nthere are those who despise the superstition, who would yet be\r\nunwilling to tempt fate (as they put it) by wilfully breaking even\r\nthe most worthless old looking-glass.\"\r\n\r\nTo break a looking-glass is considered unlucky; when broken,\r\nit is supposed to be an omen that the party to whom it belongs\r\nwill lose his best friend. Grose mentions that it betokens a\r\nmortality in the family, commonly the master. This curious\r\nsuperstition had an effect even upon the strong nerves of\r\nNapoleon, who, during one of his campaigns in Italy, broke the\r\nglass over Josephine's portrait. He never rested until the\r\nreturn of the courier despatched to obtain assurance of her\r\nsafety, so strong was the impression of her death on his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Toxnotamia, or Marriage of the Arts,\" by Barton\r\nHoliday (1630), we read: \"I have often heard them say 'tis\r\nill-luck to see one's face in a glass by candle-light.\"\r\n\r\nIn the north of England it is considered unlucky, after one\r\nhas started on a journey, to be recalled. This is an ancient superstition.\r\nLaodamia, in her letter to Protesilaus, who had left\r\nfor the Trojan war, tells him that as he was departing from\r\nhome she wished to recall him, but that fear of the ill-omen had\r\nprevented her:\r\n\r\n\"Nunc, fateor; volui revocare; animusque ferebat.\r\nSubstitit auspicii lingua timore mali.\"",

A correspondent says that in all agricultural\r\ndealings connected with cattle or corn, it is customary\r\nwhen receiving payment to return a small sum to the customer,\r\nwhich is termed \"luck-money.\" In Lincolnshire the custom is\r\none shilling per head for a beast, sixpence for a calf, sixpence\r\nfor a pig, two shillings per score for sheep above a year old,\r\none shilling per score for lambs; for horses, various sums according\r\nto their value. For corn, the factors expect a shilling\r\nper load, supposed to be for every ten quarters. The luck-money\r\nfor cattle, returned in the payments for cattle and sheep,\r\nis called \"chapman luck.\" Any sum returned over or below\r\nwhat the custom sanctions, is not considered \"chapman luck,\"\r\nbut either short luck, or extra luck, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAccording to an article in The Bristol Times and Mirror\r\n(June 23, 1877), it seems to have been, almost from time out\r\nof mind, a custom of the large Wiltshire corn markets, and\r\nespecially Salisbury, Warminster, and Devizes, for the farmers\r\nto \"throw back\" to the dealers or buyers, one shilling on every\r\nten sacks of wheat, and every ten quarters of barley.\r\n\r\nIn Roumania (as in Scotland also) on concluding a bargain,\r\nthe buyer gives a coin to the seller as \"luck-money.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a superstition that counting one's gains brings ill-luck.\r\nWith this may be compared the popular notion of the character\r\nof David's sin in numbering the people of Israel and Judah,\r\nrelated in the last chapter of the Second Book of Samuel--a\r\nnarrative which makes some people look with suspicion and\r\ndislike upon our own decennial census.\r\n\r\nThe thumb and fingers were employed by professors of chi-*",

Great misfortunes were presaged\r\nby a fall or stumble. Tiberius Gracchus, as he was going out\r\nof his house on the day of his death, stumbled upon the threshold\r\nwith such violence that he broke the nail of his great toe,\r\nso that blood gushed out of his shoe. A similar accident befell\r\nthe aged Antigonus, on the morning of the battle of Ipsus. As\r\nhe was going out of the door of his tent, he stumbled and fell\r\nflat on the ground, which was taken as a bad augury. A few\r\nhours later he was killed. Crassus and his son received a\r\nsimilar warning of the fate which awaited them as they were on\r\ntheir way to encounter the Parthians--the son stumbled, and the\r\nfather fell upon him. The one was slain at the battle of Balissus,\r\nthe other was murdered a short time after. Ovid alludes\r\nto Myrrha, on her way to Cinyras' chamber, as stumbling thrice,\r\nbut not deterred by the omen from an unnatural and fatal\r\ncrime. Protesilaus stumbled as he left his father's house to\r\nconduct his Thessalian warriors to the siege of Troy. Laodamia\r\nmarked the omen, and trembled for the fate of her lover, who\r\nwas the first victim that fell beneath Hector's blows. Tibullus,\r\nin one of his elegies, recalls the omen with dread in his verses\r\nto Messala, who had departed for Africa, whilst his friend lay\r\nsick at Corcyra:\r\n\r\n\"O quoties ingressus iter, mihi tristia dixi\r\nOffensum in porta signa dedisse pedem.\"\r\n\r\nHow William the Conqueror changed his stumble from ill to\r\ngood luck is well known.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Hardrada was\r\nmounted on a charger that stumbled and fell under his huge",

That was a bad omen, but\r\nhe had wit enough to turn it off by quoting a well-known proverb,\r\nwhich says, \"A fall is luck, if men are on a journey.\"\r\nHarold, the King of England, saw what had befallen the tall\r\nman on the black horse, and asked one of the Norsemen, of\r\nwhom there were many in his army, who it was? \"'Tis the Northmen's\r\nking,\" was the answer. \"A tall man and a proper man\r\nindeed,\" said King Harold, \"but yet 'tis likeliest that his luck\r\nhath now left him.\"\r\n\r\nGrose says it is unlucky to lay one's knife and fork crosswise;\r\ncrosses and misfortunes are likely to follow. Melton, in his\r\ncatalogue of many superstitions, observes: \"That it is naught\r\nfor any man to give a pair of knives to his sweetheart, for feare\r\nit cuts away all love that is betweene them.\" Gay, in the\r\n\"Shepherd's Week,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"But woe is me! such presents luckless prove,\r\nFor knives, they tell me, always sever love.\"\r\n\r\nGrose repeats this superstition, and adds that a pin, a farthing,\r\nor some trifling recompense must be given in return for the\r\ngift of any sharp or cutting instrument. To find a knife denotes\r\nill-luck or disappointment to the party.\r\n\r\nTo place a knife near a sleeping child was a lucky omen; so\r\nsays Herrick:\r\n\r\n\"Let the superstitious wife\r\nNear the child's heart lay a knife;\r\nPoint be up, and haft be down;\r\nWhile she gossips in the town.\r\nThis 'mongst other mystic charms\r\nKeeps the sleeping child from harms.\"\r\n\r\nAmong \"luck\" notions in Shropshire, if a knife drops it is a\r\nsign that a man is coming to the house; if a fork drops, a\r\nwoman is coming.\r\n\r\nIt is a sign of ill-luck to find money. In the \"Art of Conny-Catching\"\r\nwe read: \"It is ill-lucke to keepe found money,\r\ntherefore it must be spent.\" Home, in his \"D\u00e6monologie,\"\r\nrefers to the superstition of good luck to the finders of pieces of",
  "p5320.png": "iron. \"If they find a piece of silver, it is a foretoken of ill-luck\r\nto them.\" It is accounted a lucky omen to find a horse-shoe.\r\nThe Hon. Robert Boyle, in his \"Occasional Reflections,\"\r\nremarking on this, says: \"And, though 'twas to make myself\r\nmerry with this fond conceit of the superstitious vulgar, I stooped\r\nto take this up.\"\r\n\r\nAn excellent saying is connected with pins:\r\n\r\n\"See a pin and pick it up,\r\nAll the day you'll have good luck:\r\nSee a pin and let it lie,\r\nAll the day you'll need to cry.\"[*]\r\n\r\nThe Bretons throw pins or small pieces of money into certain\r\nwells for good luck.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country it is considered very unlucky, if\r\nwhen a body is taken to be buried, the funeral procession proceeds\r\nto the churchyard by a way which will make them meet\r\n\r\n* This saying is singularly applicable to an episode in the life of Lafitte,\r\nthe famous-French banker, who in 1788 arrived at Paris with but scanty\r\nmeans of existence, and furnished with a letter of introduction to the\r\nbanker Perregaux, to whom he applied for a situation, however humble\r\nit might be, in his counting-house. \"It is impossible to admit you into\r\nmy office, at least for the present,\" said M. Perregaux to the timid young\r\nman who addressed him; \"I would recommend you to apply elsewhere,\r\nfor I do not expect there will be a vacancy for some time to come.\" The\r\nyoung man left with a drooping heart and downcast look, but observing a\r\npin on the ground, he picked it up and placed it carefully in his coat,\r\nlittle thinking that the road to fortune was to open before him through that\r\nsimple action. The banker had seen from the window what had occurred,\r\nand being a man who judged humanity from various details, which others\r\nmight consider insignificant, it seemed to reveal to him the character of\r\nLafitte. It was a guarantee of order and economy, an assurance of all the\r\nqualities that constitute a good financialist. A young man who could thus\r\nstore a pin, must, as the banker thought, make a good clerk.\r\n\r\nThe same evening young Lafitte received a letter from M. Perregaux,\r\noffering him a situation in the bank. The discerning employer was not\r\ndeceived in his notions; the young pin-collector possessed not only the\r\nrequisite qualities for a banking house, but displayed a capacity and intelligence\r\ngreater than could have been anticipated. From a clerk he\r\nbecame cashier, afterwards a partner, and eventually the proprietor of the\r\nlargest banking establishment in Paris. Here was something better than\r\n\"luck\" in the ordinary meaning of the term.

A\r\nmodern writer, however, observes that to sit cross-legged was\r\ngenerally considered to produce good fortune. Hence it was\r\nemployed as a charm at school, by one boy who wished well to\r\nanother, in order to deprecate some punishment. At a card-*table\r\nsome superstitious persons sit cross-legged, with a view of\r\nbringing good luck.\r\n\r\nThe following Rabbinical quotation on the subject of paring\r\nthe nails, bears on the popular superstitions on that subject:\r\n\"Ungues comburit sanctus; justus sepelit eos; impius vero\r\nspargit in publicum, ut malefic\u00e6 iis abutantur.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that among the Arabians the paring\r\nof nails on a Friday, instead of being condemned, is religiously\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nIn Germany it is considered unlucky to pare babies' nails until\r\nthey are a year old. They have to be bitten off; and if this\r\nadvice be not followed, the children will grow up to stammer.\r\nThere is a notion in the West of Scotland, that if a child's nails are\r\npared before the first year of its birth, it will grow up to be a thief.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Brown, in his \"Vulgar Errors,\" admits that conjectures\r\nof prevalent humours may be collected from spots in our\r\nnails, but rejects the sundry divinations vulgarly raised upon\r\nthem; such as, that spots in the top of the nails signify things\r\npast; in the middle, things present; and at the bottom, events\r\nto come--that white specks presage our felicity, blue ones our\r\nmisfortunes; those in the nail of the thumb have significations\r\nof honour; of the forefinger, riches.\r\n\r\nMoles appear to have denoted a great variety of good or ill\r\nluck: one on the throat was fortunate; on the lower jaw of a\r\nwoman it was the reverse; one of a honey colour ensured love,\r\nbut red and black were unlucky; if raised more like a wart, the\r\npossessor would be fortunate. A mole on the right side, about",

A mole on the left side of\r\nthe forehead near the hair, was ominous of ill-luck. One on\r\nthe left side of the forehead a little above the temple, if it appeared\r\nred, secured excellent wit and understanding; but black\r\ndenoted falsehood. A mole on the chin was lucky, bringing\r\nriches--also on the ear and neck; but one on the right breast\r\nforetold poverty. One near the bottom of the nostrils was\r\nlucky, also one on the right foot, whereas the left foot so encumbered\r\nwas unlucky. A mole on the eyebrow was a good\r\nomen, also one on the wrist. Many moles between the elbow\r\nand the wrist betokened crosses towards the middle of life,\r\nbut prosperity and comfort at the end.\r\n\r\nIn Misson's \"Travels in England,\" we find mention of a\r\ncurious belief, that those who had warts or moles on the face\r\nwere very careful of the great hairs that grew out of these\r\nexcrescences: \"Several have told me that they look upon those\r\nhairs as tokens of good luck.\"[*]\r\n\r\nWhen children in South Sweden cast their teeth, the said\r\nteeth are thrown into the fire. To throw a tooth when extracted\r\ninto the fire for luck, is still observed, not only in some parts of\r\nEngland and Scotland, but abroad. In Switzerland the tooth\r\nis carefully wrapped in paper, and a little salt enclosed with it,\r\nand it is then thrown into the fire. In the \"Countryman's\r\nCounseller\" (1633) we find: \"To lose an eye or a tooth signifies\r\nthe death of some friend, or kinsman, or other evil luck.\"\r\n\r\n* The following curious advertisement, with no date attached to it,\r\nbut apparently about the reign of Queen Anne, is among the Harleian\r\nMSS.

Luckier\r\nit was to meet a frog than a priest. In \"Dives and Pauper\"\r\n(1493), we read: \"Some man hadde levyr to meet with a\r\nFroude or a Frogge in the way than with a knight or a squier,\r\nor with any man of religion, or of holy churche, for than they\r\nsay and leve that they shal have gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe following occurs in one of Decker's plays (1630): \"I\r\nam the most wretched fellow: sure some left-handed priest\r\nchristened me, I am so unlucky!\"\r\n\r\nGaule, in his \"Mag-astromancers posed and puzzel'd,\" holds\r\nit as a vain observation \"to bode good or bad luck from the\r\nrising up on the right or left side;[*] from lifting the left leg\r\n\r\n* To rise on the right side was accounted lucky.

Eustathius, upon\r\nHomer, observed that sneezing to the left was unlucky, but\r\nprosperous on the right. Aristotle inquires why sneezing from\r\nnoon to midnight was good, but from night to noon unlucky?\r\nSt. Austin mentions that the ancients were wont to go to bed\r\nagain if they sneezed while they put on their shoes, a lame\r\nexcuse for sloth and indolence. An imperial sneeze from a\r\nruler in Africa was considered such an indication of good luck,\r\nthat acclamation rose from every part of the city. Zenophon\r\nhaving ended a speech to his soldiers with these words, \"We\r\nhave many reasons to hope for preservation,\" one of the men\r\ngave a loud sneeze, which was immediately interpreted as a\r\nsign of good luck, and improved upon accordingly by the adroit\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nRoss, in his \"Arcana Microcosmi,\" says: \"Prometheus was\r\nthe first that wisht well to the sneezer, when the man which he\r\nhad made of clay fell into a fit of sternutation upon the ap-*",

Thee, a lucky sneeze\r\nTo Sparta welcomed.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in another Idyllium:\r\n\r\n\"The Loves sneezed on Smichid.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Themistocles was offering sacrifice, it happened that\r\nthree beautiful captives were brought to him, and at the same\r\ntime the fire burnt clear and bright, and a sneeze happened on\r\nthe right hand. Hereupon the soothsayer, embracing him,\r\npredicted the memorable victory which was afterwards obtained\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nBlessing the sneezer in present times was an absurdity that\r\nprevailed among the ancients. Cicero says: \"Qu\u00e6 si suscipiamus,\r\npedis offensio nobis, et abruptio corrigi\u00e6, et sternutamenta\r\nerunt observanda.\"\r\n\r\nA passage in the \"Golden Legend\" states, concerning a\r\npestilence that broke out at Rome, and produced instant death:\r\n\"In this manner some snesynge they deyed; soo when ony\r\npersone was herde snesinge, anone they y' were by sayd to him,\r\nGod helpe you, or Cryst helpe you; and yet endureth y^e custome.\r\nAnd also whan he snesyth or gapeth, he maketh before his face\r\nthe sygne of the crosse, and blysseth hym, and yet endureth\r\nthis custome.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a story that is related of a young man living with\r\nfairies for a year, who took him to fairs and weddings, where,\r\nunseen by mortal eyes, they feasted on the good things spread\r\nabout. They had one day gone to a wedding where the cheer\r\nwas abundant During the feast the bridegroom sneezed.\r\nThe young man, according to the usual custom, said \"God",
  "p5410.png": "bless you.\" The fairies were offended at the mention of the\r\nsacred name, and assured him that if he dared to repeat it they\r\nwould punish him. The bridegroom sneezed a second time.\r\nHe repeated his blessing; they threatened more tremendous\r\nvengeance. He sneezed a third time; and the young man\r\nblessed him as before. The fairies were enraged; they tumbled\r\nhim from a precipice, but he found himself unhurt, and was\r\nrestored to his friends.\r\n\r\nWriting of Wildbad, Dasent mentions that \"in some cases\r\nthe private baths are close to the common bath, and you may\r\nhear every word that is spoken. Once, when we sneezed in\r\nour private bath, half a dozen voices from the public bath cried\r\nout in chorus, \"God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nIn Clodd's \"Childhood of the World\" we find, \"According\r\nto an old Jewish legend, the custom of saying 'God bless you,'\r\nwhen a person sneezes, dates from Jacob. The Rabbis say that\r\nbefore the time that Jacob lived, men sneezed once, and that\r\nwas the end of them; the shock slew them. This law was set\r\naside on the prayer of Jacob, on condition that in all nations a\r\nsneeze should be hallowed by the words, 'God bless you.'\"\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Notes and Queries\" gives a translation from the\r\nPali text of the Gagga Jataka on this superstition: \"One day,\r\nBuddha, while seated in the midst of a large congregation of\r\ndisciples, to whom he was preaching the law, chanced to sneeze.\r\nThereupon the priests, exclaiming, 'May the blessed Lord live;\r\nmay the Welcome One live,' made a loud noise, and seriously\r\ninterrupted the discourse. Accordingly, Buddha addressed them\r\nas follows: 'Tell me, priests, when a person sneezes, if the\r\nbystanders say, \"May you live,\" will he live the longer, or die the\r\nsooner for it?' 'Certainly not, Lord.' 'Then, priests, if any\r\none sneezes you are not to say to him, \"May you live;\" and if\r\nany of you shall say it, let him be guilty of a transgression.'\r\nFrom that time forth, when the priests sneezed, and the bystanders\r\nexclaimed, 'May you live, sirs;' the priests, fearful of\r\ntransgressing, held their peace. People took offence at this:\r\n'What,' said they, 'do these priestly sons of Sakya mean by",
  "p5420.png": "not uttering a word when we say \"May you live, sirs\"? The\r\nmatter came to Buddha's ears: 'Priests,' he said, 'the laity are\r\nthe corner-stones of the Church; when laymen say, \"May you\r\nlive, sirs,\" I give my sanction to your replying, \"Long life to\r\nyou.\"'\"\r\n\r\nThe Jataka book, from which this story is taken, is part\r\nof the Buddhist Scriptures, and belongs to a period far antecedent\r\nto the Christian era. (\"Notes and Queries,\" vol ii.,\r\nseries 5.)\r\n\r\nIn India, at the present day, one may observe the quasi sign\r\nof the cross which a Hindoo makes, should he chance to sneeze\r\nwhile performing his morning's ablutions in the Ganges.\r\nHaving touched his forehead, nose, chin, and cheeks, with the\r\ntip of his fingers, he recommences his prayers from the very\r\nbeginning, and will do so as often as they are interrupted by a\r\nsneeze.\r\n\r\nIn 1542, when Hernando de Soto, at the period of the\r\nSpanish conquest in America, had an interview with the\r\nchief Guachoya, the latter, during the conversation, happened\r\nto sneeze. Upon this all their attendants bowed their heads,\r\nopened and closed their arms, and making their signs of\r\nveneration, saluted their prince with various phrases of the same\r\npurport: \"May the sun guard you;\" \"May the sun be with\r\nyou;\" \"May the sun shine upon you--defend you--prosper\r\nyou;\" and the like. Each uttered the phrase that came first\r\nto his mind, and for a short time there was a universal murmuring\r\nof these compliments.\r\n\r\nMariner, in his account of the Tonga Islands, states that the\r\nnatives considered a sneeze at the moment of setting out on an\r\nexpedition, as fraught with the most fatal results.\r\n\r\nHerman says that \"Two or iij nesys be holson, one is a\r\nshrowed token.\"\r\n\r\nPalsgrave observes: \"The physicians saye when one neseth\r\nit is a good sygne, but an yuell cause.\"\r\n\r\nHowell (1659) observes: \"He that hath sneezed thrice, turn\r\nhim out of the hospital.\"",
  "p5430.png": "\r\nBishop Hall alludes to the custom, in speaking of a superstitious\r\nperson, who, \"when he neeseth[** sneeseth?], thinks them not his\r\nfriends that uncover not.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the queer-titled books common in the time of\r\nCharles I. and Cromwell, we find \"The Spiritual Mustard Pot,\r\nto make the Soul Sneeze with Devotion!\"\r\n\r\nIn the comedy called \"Lingua, or the Combat of the Tongue\r\nand the Five Senses for Superiority,\" 1607, there is an allusion\r\nto sneezing as a fortunate portent. Tactus, in a soliloquy,\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n\"Tactus, thy sneezing somewhat did portend!\r\n\"Was ever man so fortunate as I?\"\r\n\r\nThis is interesting from a curious tradition respecting Oliver\r\nCromwell, who is said in his youth to have taken this character\r\nwhen the comedy was acted by the scholars of the school\r\n(Huntingdon [?]) of which he was one.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire the saying is: \"To sneeze on Monday hastens\r\nanger; to sneeze on Friday, give a gift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sneeze on Sunday morning fasting,\r\nYou'll enjoy your own true love to everlasting.\"\r\n\r\nIf you sneeze on a Saturday night, after the candle is lighted,\r\nyou will next week see a stranger you never saw before.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, if a sneeze occurred after dinner, a dish\r\nwas brought back and tasted to avert misfortune.\r\n\r\nAmong the Zulus, repeated yawning and sneezing are classed\r\ntogether as signs of approaching spiritual possession. The\r\nHindoo, when he gapes, must snap his thumb and finger, and\r\nrepeat the name of some god, as Rama; to neglect this is a sin\r\nas great as the murder of a Brahmin. The Persians ascribe\r\nyawning, sneezing, etc., to demoniacal possession. Among the\r\nMoslems generally when a man yawns, he puts the back of his\r\nleft hand to his mouth, saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah from\r\nSatan the accursed;\" but the act of yawning is to be avoided,\r\nfor the devil is in the habit of leaping into a gaping mouth.",
  "p5440.png": "\r\n[** no indent]Spitting for \"luck's\" sake, and moreover as a charm\r\nagainst all kinds of fascinations, was of considerable\r\nimportance among the ancients; we have the words of\r\nTheocritus:\r\n\r\n\"Thrice on my breast I spit to guard me safe\r\nFrom fascinating charms.\"\r\n\r\nThus, among the Greeks, it was customary to spit three times\r\ninto their bosoms at the sight of a madman, or one troubled\r\nwith an epilepsy. Children were lustrated with spittle by their\r\nnurses, or relations; the old grandmother, or aunt, moved\r\naround in a circle, and rubbed the child's forehead with spittle,\r\nand that with her middle finger, to preserve it from witchcraft.\r\n\r\nPersius alludes to this custom:\r\n\r\n\"See how old beldams expiation make,\r\nTo atone the gods the bantling up they take;\r\nHis lips are wet with lustrous spittle; thus\r\nThey think to make the gods propitious.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first book of the \"Occult Philosophy\" of Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, we find, in regard to spitting: \"It is a wonderful\r\nthing, but easy to experience that Pliny speaks of,--if any one\r\nshall be sorry for any blow that he hath given another afar off,\r\nor nigh at hand, if he shall presently spit into the middle of the\r\nhand with which he gave the blow, the party that was smitten\r\nshall presently be freed from pain. This, we are told, hath been\r\napproved of in a four-footed beast that hath been sorely hurt.\r\nSome there are that in the same way aggravate a blow before\r\nthey give it, as to this day do our pugilists and spade\r\nlabourers.\"\r\n\r\nSpitting, to avert evil influences, was considered by some\r\nancient heretics (the Messalians) an essential act of religion.\r\nThey kept perpetually spitting and blowing their noses to get\r\nrid of the demons with which the air was filled, and to ensure\r\ngood luck.\r\n\r\nSpitting, as an Irish luck superstition, is noticed by Camden:\r\n\"It is by no means allowable to praise a horse, or any other",
  "p5450.png": "animal, unless you say, 'God save him,' or spit upon him. If\r\nany ill-luck befalls the horse three days after, they find out the\r\nperson who commended him, that he may whisper the Lord's\r\nPrayer into his right ear.\"\r\n\r\nSpitting for good luck has still its votaries among hucksters,\r\npedlars, and others. Grose mentions it as a common practice\r\nin his time. Misson, in his \"Travels in England,\" says: \"A\r\nwoman that goes much to market told me t'other day that the\r\nbutcher-women of London, those that sell fowls, butter, eggs, etc.,\r\nand, in general, most tradespeople, have a peculiar esteem for\r\nwhat they call a handsel, that is to say, the first money they\r\nreceive in the morning; they kiss it, spit upon it, and put it in\r\na pocket by itself.\"\r\n\r\nIn Roumania, among dealers, the first money taken in the\r\nday is spat upon for luck. The same custom is in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn Russia it is considered unlucky on leaving a house to meet\r\na priest; this may be averted by throwing a pin at him if you\r\nare a woman, or by spitting on his beard if you are a man.\r\n\r\nA Yorkshire custom to secure luck when a rainbow appeared,\r\nwas making a cross on the ground and spitting on each of its\r\nfour corners.\r\n\r\nTHE theory of \"lucky numbers\" was in great favour in the\r\ndays of lotteries. At the drawing, papers were put into\r\na hollow wheel, inscribed with as many different numbers as\r\nthere were shares or tickets; one of these was drawn out, and\r\nthe number audibly announced. With a view to lucky numbers,\r\none man would select his own age, or the age of his wife;\r\nanother would venture the date of the year; others, odd or\r\neven numbers. Some, whose minds were full of thoughts on\r\nthe lottery, would dream of a certain number, and risk the\r\nchance, In the Spectator (No. 191, October 9, 1711), there\r\nis a humorous notice of these vagaries; the man who selected\r\n1711 because it was the year of our Lord; the other who\r\nsought for 134 because it constituted the minority on a celebrated\r\nbill in the House of Commons; one who selected the",
  "p5460.png": "mark of the \"Beast,\" 666, on the ground that wicked beings\r\nare often lucky. One lady in 1790 bought number 17,090,\r\nbecause she thought it was the nearest in sound to 1790. On\r\none occasion a tradesman bought four tickets, consecutive in\r\nnumbers; he thought it foolish to have them so close together,\r\nand took one back to the office to be exchanged, which turned\r\nout afterwards to be a twenty thousand pound prize.\r\n\r\nMelton, in his \"Astrologaster,\" speaking of divination by\r\nlots, says: \"The Dutchmen are very skilful at this, and have\r\ncozened the English of infinite masses of money by their selling\r\nof papers, or lottery tickets.\"\r\n\r\nA book was published at Amsterdam in 1696, \"Reflection\r\non what is called Good--or ill--Luck in Lotteries,\" in which\r\nthe author takes the very sensible belief that the fortunate lots\r\ndo not run for, or against, certain persons, with any sort of distinction.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated Milan, May 6, 1859, published in the\r\nStandard newspaper (May 17), is the following curious instance\r\nof superstition: \"On Friday a frightful murder, followed\r\nby suicide, was committed in a house on the Corso. A man\r\nemployed as cook in a private family had for some time been\r\non bad terms with a young woman, his fellow-servant. On this\r\noccasion words somewhat higher than usual had passed between\r\nthe two, and the man, goaded to fury by some irritating expression\r\nused by his companion, inflicted on her a deadly blow\r\nwith a large kitchen knife, and then threw himself out of a\r\nhigh second-floor window into the street, fracturing his skull\r\nupon the pavement below. An immense run will accordingly\r\nbe made this week by lottery gamblers upon the 'numbers'\r\nwhich, by popular superstition, are supposed to correspond with\r\na fractured skull, a kitchen knife, a window, and other prominent\r\nfeatures of this lamentable affair.\"\r\n\r\nWITH regard to \"chance\" games, or, to use a general\r\nterm, gambling, luck may be said to be the presiding\r\ngenius, and to influence, according to popular superstition, the",
  "p5470.png": "good or ill fortune of those who engaged in them. My notices\r\non this subject must be necessarily brief. Mr. Proctor, in his\r\n\"Borderland of Science,\" very justly remarks that \"there has\r\nnever been a successful gambler who has not believed that his\r\nsuccess (temporary though such success ever is, where games\r\nof pure chance are concerned) has been the result of skilful\r\nconduct on his own part; and there never has been a ruined\r\ngambler (though ruined gamblers are to be counted by thousands)\r\nwho has not believed that when ruin overtook him,\r\nhe was on the very point of mastering the secret of success. It\r\nis this fatal confidence which gives to gambling its power of\r\nfascinating the lucky, as well as the unlucky. The winner continues\r\nto tempt fortune, believing all the while that he is\r\nexerting some special aptitude for games of chance, until the\r\ninevitable change of luck arrives; and thereafter he continues\r\nto play because he believes that his luck has only deserted him\r\nfor a time, and must presently return. The unlucky gambler,\r\non the contrary, regards his losses as sacrifices to ensure the\r\nultimate success of his 'system,' and even when he has lost his\r\nall, continues firm in the belief that had he had more money\r\nto sacrifice, he could have bound fortune to his side for ever.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Houdin, if a player gets into a passion, it is all\r\nover with prudence (which is essential in gaming, as in all other\r\npursuits), all over with good luck, for the demon of bad luck\r\ninvariably pursues a passionate player, as it always accompanies\r\na violent temper.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a gambler (remarks Mr. Proctor) who is\r\nnot prepared to assert his faith in certain observances whereby,\r\nas he believes, a change of luck may be brought about (such as\r\na change of seats, a new deal, or the like). In an old work on\r\ncard-games, the player is gravely advised, if the luck be against\r\nhim, to turn three times round with his chair, \"for then the\r\nluck will infallibly change in your favour.\"\r\n\r\nCuthbert Bede, in \"Notes and Queries,\" writes: \"I had\r\nthis bit of folk-lore from a Worcestershire farmer: 'There was\r\nnever a good hand at cards if the four of clubs was in it.'",
  "p5480.png": "'Why?' 'Because the four of clubs is an unlucky card; it's\r\nthe devil's own card.' 'In what way?' 'It's the devil's four-post\r\nbedstead.'\"\r\n\r\nBacon, in his \"Sylva Sylvarum,\" remarks: \"There is a folly\r\nvery usual with gamesters, to imagine some bystanders bring\r\nthem ill-luck.\"\r\n\r\nIN Bohemia the peasantry hold it unlucky to walk under\r\na rainbow, and they say that the rain which descends\r\nthrough the bow blights all it falls upon.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients good and ill luck were derived from\r\nthunder and lightning; if these occurred on the left, the omen\r\nwas favourable. The Persians and Greeks differed, however,\r\nfrom the Romans, the right being considered lucky. Lightning\r\nshot from the east, returning again after a circuit of the sky to\r\nthe same quarter, was favourable, and is reported to have proved\r\nso to the dictator Sylla. Thunder, in reports even in number,\r\nportended good luck; lightning, from north to west, evil,\r\nespecially if accompanied with hail, or if it struck men or\r\ntemples, or descended from a clear sky. On this last point,\r\nhowever, the Greeks differed from the Romans; when Jove\r\nthundered from the cloudless serene to Ulysses it rejoiced his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe moon exercises a great influence on good or ill luck;\r\nthus, to see a new moon the first time after change, on the right\r\nhand or directly before you, betokens the utmost good luck;\r\nas to have her on your left or behind you, so that in turning\r\nyour head back you happen to see her, foreshows the worst.\r\n\r\nMungo Park, speaking of the Africans, says: \"They think it\r\nvery unlucky to begin a journey, or any other work of consequence,\r\nin the last quarter of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England it is still supposed to be unlucky\r\nto look at the new moon for the first time through the window.\r\n\r\nA new moon seen over the right shoulder is lucky; over the\r\nleft shoulder is unlucky, and straight before you prognosticates\r\ngood luck to the end of the season.",
  "p5490.png": "\r\nThe inhabitants of most of our rural districts still retain the\r\nold dislike to a new moon on Friday. Some persons, however,\r\ncontend that Saturday is the unlucky day for the new, and\r\nSunday equally so for a full moon:\r\n\r\n\"Saturday's new, and Sunday's full,\r\nWas never fine, nor never wool.\"\r\n\r\nTHE following instances of good and ill luck relate to\r\nWeardale, co. Durham: If the good wife's keys persist\r\nin getting rusty, some friend is laying up money for her. A\r\nfortune is also foreboded by a hot cinder, called a purse,\r\njumping out of the fire; but if the cinder does not rattle, it\r\nindicates ill-luck. If meat shrink in the pot when boiling, it is\r\nunlucky; if it swells, it is a sign of prosperity. Should the good\r\nwife cut the first cake from the oven, all the rest will be heavy;\r\nthe first cake must be broken. Do not sweep the dust out of\r\nthe front door, or you sweep away your fortune; and be sure\r\nand spit on the first coin you get in the morning, or the first you\r\ntake in any business. If a leaf of soot hang on the fire-grate,\r\nor the cock crow on the threshold, you may expect a stranger;\r\nand if you forget to put down the lid of the teapot, a friend will\r\ndrop in to tea.\r\n\r\nTHE Venetian luck-lore has many definitions, some of them\r\nsimilar to those in our own and other countries. \"If\r\nyou wash your face and hands in the water another has washed\r\nin, you will come to blows. To sweep dust over the feet or\r\nlegs of a girl will prevent her getting a husband. It is unlucky\r\nto wear trousers made on a Friday, as they soon wear out.\r\nBabies' nails should not be cut before they are a year old, or\r\nthey will turn out thieves. It is unlucky to measure a baby, as\r\nit will not grow. Crying children are lucky, they will have fine\r\neyes and broad shoulders. To hear the ticking like a watch in\r\nthe house is a sign of a great misfortune. If a feathered\r\nanimal comes into the house it brings bad luck. When a dog\r\nscratches a hole in the ground there will be a funeral in the",
  "p5500.png": "family. If a cat gets under a sick man's bed, and will not come\r\nout, he will die. To give needles is unlucky, and brings a loss\r\nof friendship, unless each pricks the other. It is unlucky to\r\nmake a number of crumbs at meals, whoever does so will never\r\nhave money to spare.\" (This last saying may be safely recommended\r\nto the world at large.) \"Sweeping at night drives\r\ngood luck away. To drop anything shows that visitors are\r\ncoming; if it should be a comb, a woman will come; if a tooth-comb,\r\nit will be a man.\"\r\n\r\nIN the Times (May 28, 1851) it is stated, that a woman,\r\ncalled as a witness on a trial, refused to be sworn, with the\r\nremark it must be evident to the magistrate that she could not\r\ntake an oath. The usher of the court said the woman was in\r\nthe family way, and that low women who were in that condition\r\nentertained an absurd belief that it was unlucky to take an\r\noath.\r\n\r\nIt is unlucky for children to walk backwards while going on\r\nan errand; it is a sign they will be unfortunate in their object.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Scotland it is a popular notion among the\r\nlower classes, that when a child is for the first time taken into\r\nthe open air, the bearer of it should give something edible (such\r\nas bread and cheese) to the first person met; otherwise, the\r\nchild's fate will be unlucky. The gift is called \"the bairn's\r\npiece.\"\r\n\r\nIn the West of Scotland (says Mr. James Napier) it was considered\r\nunlucky to name a child by any name before the rite of\r\nbaptism was performed. When a child was taken from its\r\nmother, and carried outside the bedroom for the first time after\r\nits birth, it was lucky to take it upstairs, and unlucky to take it\r\ndownstairs. If there were no stairs in the house, the person\r\nwho carried it generally ascended three steps of a ladder, or\r\ntemporary erection; and this, it was supposed, would bring\r\nprosperity to the child. When the baby was being carried to\r\nchurch to be baptized, it was important that the woman\r\nappointed to this post should be known to be lucky. It was",
  "p5510.png": "not considered safe or proper to carry a baby into any neighbour's\r\nhouse until the mother took it herself; and this it was\r\nunlucky even for her to do, until she had been to church.\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS of good or ill luck by dreams are innumerable,\r\nand have found believers in past ages; and we may\r\nadd, in a milder form of credulity, even at the present time.

These come, to\r\nsay the least, near fulfilling the idea of perfect works of the kind; and the illustrations\r\nwith which the volume is embellished are equally excellent.... We\r\ncommend the book to parents and teachers as an admirable gift to their children\r\nand pupils.\" LITERARY WORLD.\r\n\r\nOne VOL crown 8vo, cloth extra, 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\nTaylor's (Tom) Historical Dramas:\r\n\r\n\"Clancarty,\" \"Jeanne Darc,\" \"Twixt Axe and Crown,\" \"The Fool's\r\nRevenge,\" \"Arkwright's Wife,\" \"Anne Boleyn,\" \"Plot and Passion.\"\r\n[** 3 x asterisms] The Plays may also be had separately, at 1s. each.\r\n\r\nCrown 8vo, cloth extra, with Coloured Frontispiece and numerous\r\nIllustrations, 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThackerayana:\r\n\r\nNotes and Anecdotes.

With Hundreds of Wood Engravings, facsimiled from\r\nMr. Thackeray's Original Drawings.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been a real loss to bibliographical literature had copyright\r\ndifficulties deprived the general public of this very amusing collection. One of\r\nThackeray's habits, from his schoolboy days, was to ornament the margins and\r\nblank pages of the books he had in use with caricature illustrations of their\r\ncontents. This gave special value to the sale of his library, and is almost cause\r\nfor regret that it could not have been preserved in its integrity. Thackeray's\r\nplace in literature is eminent enough to have made this an interest to future\r\ngenerations. The anonymous editor has done the best that he could to compensate\r\nfor the lack of this. It is an admirable addendum, not only to his collected\r\nworks, but also to any memoir of him that has been, or that is likely to be,\r\nwritten.\"--British Quarterly Review.\r\n\r\nCrown 8vo, cloth extra, with numerous Illustrations, 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThornbury's (Walter) Haunted London.\r\n\r\nA New Edition, edited by EDWARD WALFORD, M.A., with numerous\r\nIllustrations by F.

His memory\r\nand his note-books were stored with anecdote, and, as he had singular skill in the\r\nmatter of narration, it will be readily believed that when he took to writing a set\r\nbook about the places he knew and cared for, the said book would be charming.\r\nCharming the volume before us certainly is. It may be begun in the beginning, or\r\nmiddle, or end, it is all one: wherever one lights, there is some pleasant and\r\ncurious bit of gossip, some amusing fragment of allusion or quotation.\"--VANITY\r\nFAIR.",
