The southern campaign\r\nhad been undertaken at the wish and upon the\r\nplan of Cornwallis. He knew how pronounced division\r\nof opinion was in the South, and how certain a hold\r\ncould be got there upon the sympathy of scores of men\r\nwho could be of the utmost service to an army in the\r\nfield. He knew how important it was to close the southern\r\nports, and particularly the Chesapeake, in order\r\nto shut out the supplies that came steadily in from\r\nover sea. He believed that an effectual blow struck\r\nfrom the south at Virginia, after the reduction of the\r\nfar southern ports, would secure for the British an almost\r\ncommanding position on the continent. Had\r\nClinton helped him promptly, instead of grudging\r\nhim aid; had he been enabled to move rapidly and in\r\nforce as he had planned, he might have accomplished",
  "022.png": "his purpose effectually, even brilliantly. Even as it\r\nwas, there had been something very striking about the\r\nmanner in which he had fought his way from the far\r\nsouthern coasts to Yorktown: the boldness with which\r\nhe had dared to risk all his connections to deliver a\r\nblow; the success with which he had beat off the Americans\r\nwhenever he was himself personally in command;\r\nthe comparative freedom with which he had moved\r\nin Virginia, despite the gathering strength of the forces\r\nunder Lafayette. It was the express orders of Clinton,\r\nhis superior, that had caged him at Yorktown; and it\r\nwas but seven thousand men he yielded to his fourteen\r\nthousand besiegers and de Grasse's fleet in the Bay.\r\nIt was characteristic of Sir Henry Clinton that he did\r\nnot start from New York to bring the long-needed aid\r\nuntil the very day of his comrade's surrender. The\r\nusual thing had happened. An incompetent commander-in-chief\r\nhad dallied and blundered with Washington\r\nat hand to take advantage of every blunder like\r\na master. Sir Henry had gone to succor Cornwallis\r\nas he had gone to meet Burgoyne, when the campaign\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nLord North knew what the news meant when it came.\r\nHe received it \"as he would have taken a ball in his\r\nbreast, opening his arms and exclaiming wildly, 'O\r\nGod! it is all over!'\" But when that first moment of\r\npoignant chagrin was past, no doubt a very distinct\r\nsense of relief ensued, to offset the bitterness of the\r\nhumiliating blow. It was imperative for England\r\nthat the American war should end. She was beset.\r\nFrance and Spain had taken advantage of the revolt\r\nof the colonies once more to attack her,--not because\r\nthey loved America or sympathized with the ideals of",

  "024.png": "liberty for which she fought, but because they wished\r\nto make good against England the threatened disaster.\r\nUnited, they were as strong as she upon the seas. Louis\r\nXVI. had diligently courted peace with his neighbors\r\non the continent, and had spent the money of France\r\nfor ships and efficient sailors. Early in 1779 a French\r\nsquadron had seized the English possessions in Senegal\r\nand on the Gambia. That same year a combined French\r\nand Spanish fleet swept through the Channel, no English\r\nforce daring to oppose it. His work in the Chesapeake\r\nfinished, de Grasse had returned again, upon\r\nthe surrender of Cornwallis, to his attack upon the\r\nBritish West Indies, and before another spring came\r\nhe had reduced every English island of the Caribbean\r\nSea except Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Antigua. An\r\nEnglish fleet out of New York had attacked him at\r\nthe capes of the Chesapeake, trying to break the trap\r\ninto which Cornwallis had fallen, but had been beaten\r\noff. In May, 1781, a Spanish force had taken Pensacola\r\nand driven the English from Florida; and in\r\nFebruary, 1782, a Spanish fleet captured Minorca, and\r\na closer siege than ever was drawn about Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nFinding herself at war with half the world, England\r\nhad claimed the right to search neutral vessels on the\r\nhigh seas for goods belonging to her enemies, and to\r\nconfiscate them when found; had claimed also the\r\nright to seize vessels trading with such of her enemies'\r\nports as she had declared blockaded, whether she had\r\nactually blockaded them or not; and so had set the\r\nrest of the world against her. The northern states of\r\nEurope, headed by Russia, drew together in a league\r\nof \"Armed Neutrality,\" determined to assert in force\r\nthe doctrine that \"free ships make free goods,\"--a",

Wars with the native princes of\r\nIndia had been heaped upon her other burdens since\r\n1778, and France had sent a formidable armament\r\nthither, as she had sent an armament to America, at\r\nthe moment of most critical danger, demanding that\r\nEngland relinquish everything except Bengal. It was\r\nno time to reconquer America.\r\n\r\nOpinion as well as fortune had set against the further\r\nprosecution of the war against the colonies. At first\r\nopinion had seemed to sustain it. The nation, so far as\r\nany man could tell, believed it necessary and desirable\r\nthat the colonies should be brought to obedience. But\r\nwith the progress of the war opinion had veered. Uneasiness\r\nand disquiet had ensued, not merely because\r\nevery campaign had ended in failure, but also because\r\nof the very fact of the war,--a war against Englishmen,\r\nand upon questions which abode at home as well as in\r\nAmerica. It was noteworthy that the country seemed\r\nto grow more and more dissatisfied with Parliament and\r\nwith the subtile power of the King to rule in every turn\r\nof affairs. There began to be, for the first time in England,\r\nan articulate \"public opinion,\" which was not\r\nthe opinion of the Commons but an opinion uttered in\r\nmass meetings such as Mr. Wilkes's friends had found\r\nout how to assemble and make use of.

The treasury of the\r\nState was empty, but a hastily equipped force of militia\r\nunder General Lincoln, paid for by a temporary loan\r\nraised by a few patriotic citizens, dispersed the rebels\r\nand restored the authority of the government. It was\r\nan ominous thing, nevertheless, to see how the people\r\nof the State sympathized with the rebels. They would\r\nnot have Bowdoin for governor again, deeming him too\r\nharsh. Rhode Island passed resolutions of sympathy\r\nfor the rebels and Vermont offered them refuge. Leaders\r\nof the rebel force were captured and convicted, but\r\nno one dreamed of venturing to execute upon them the\r\npenalty denounced by the law against what they had\r\ndone. The rebellion had plainly been a symptom, not\r\nan isolated or singular thing.

It made them fear the worst, too, for\r\nthe honor and very life of the country to see how debt\r\ndemoralized the States: how they yielded upon every side\r\nto the temptation to repudiate their obligations by some\r\nnew evasion, and encouraged individuals to practise a\r\nlike dishonesty by passing stay laws against the collection\r\nof private debts and making legal tender of paper\r\nmoney issued without limit, whose value dropped with\r\nevery week it was in use.

They united, therefore, in appointing commissioners\r\nto meet at Alexandria in March, 1785, to\r\nconsult upon this matter not only, but also upon the\r\ngeneral commercial relations of the two commonwealths\r\nwhich this matter touched and which there was no general\r\ngovernment to regulate. Washington invited the\r\ncommissioners to adjourn to Mount Vernon, near by, as\r\nhis guests; and there, though not of their number, he\r\nwas freely admitted to their counsels. They did not\r\nreport to their legislatures all the hopes and questions to\r\nwhich their thoughts had broadened as they talked, but\r\nthey set forth matters significant enough for the present.\r\nThe Potomac, they pointed out, could not be connected\r\nwith the western waters without affecting Pennsylvania,\r\nas well as Maryland and Virginia; they recommended,\r\ntherefore, that she also be called into conference before\r\nthat business was carried further.

If\r\nPennsylvania was to be drawn into conference about\r\nthe Potomac, why should not Delaware also be consulted,\r\nwith a view to carrying a straight water-course,\r\nby canal, from Chesapeake Bay to the Delaware River?\r\nAnd if Pennsylvania and Delaware might be asked to\r\nconfer about these specific things, what was to prevent a\r\ngeneral conference of the States, in which all the uncomfortable\r\nquestions of their intercourse with one another\r\nmight be frankly discussed? Governor Bowdoin, of\r\nMassachusetts, had that very year urged his legislature\r\nto invite the States to such a general convention,\r\nin the interests of amicable trade, and it might be that\r\nit would meet with universal approbation.\r\n\r\nVirginia was willing. There were men in her legislature\r\nto whom such suggestions seemed full of hope\r\nand good counsel. Under their influence, therefore, the\r\nBurgesses (January, 1786) asked all the States of the\r\nConfederation to send delegates to a convention to be\r\nheld at Annapolis on the first Monday of September, to\r\nconsider the questions of trade and common intercourse\r\nwhich were disturbing the whole country. The response\r\nwas disappointing. Connecticut, South Carolina,\r\nand Georgia ignored the call altogether. Even\r\nMaryland fell suddenly indifferent and failed to act,\r\nthough the plan was her own. New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, and North Carolina appointed\r\ndelegates, but when the conference had assembled it was\r\nfound that they had not taken the trouble to attend.\r\nOnly Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey,\r\nand New York were represented; and their delegates",

Alexander\r\nHamilton had been born, and bred as a lad, in the West\r\nIndies. He had established himself while yet a very\r\nyoung man in New York; but he had taken no color\r\nfrom the place; had kept a mind detached from merely\r\nlocal interests and provincial prejudices; had served\r\nunder Washington in the field, as his aide and confidant;\r\nand had learned to see as clearly as any of his\r\nelders in affairs the needs and dangers of the country.\r\nHe lacked still several months of being thirty; but he\r\nhad been quickened to a singular maturity in that time\r\nof stress. He proposed an address to the States in which\r\nthey should be asked to come together at Philadelphia,\r\non the second Monday of the following May, not merely\r\nfor the consideration of questions of trade, but also for\r\nthe purpose of devising \"such further provisions as\r\nshould appear to them necessary to render the constitution\r\nof the federal government adequate to the exigencies\r\nof the Union,\" and of reporting to the Congress\r\n\"such an act as would effectually provide for the same\";\r\nand the conference, being in earnest, adopted the paper\r\nas he had drawn it.",

There\r\nwas no common power, no effectual combination, no\r\naggregate force to render it beyond peradventure firm\r\nand lasting. The object-lesson had come in good\r\nseason. The Congress of the Confederation had heretofore\r\nbeen opposed to a general conference; it now\r\nsanctioned and advised it. The States were at last\r\neffectually shaken from their indifference, and appointed\r\ndelegates to attend at Philadelphia in May,\r\nto take part in the new Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nIt proved a notable assembly,--more notable than\r\nthe Congress of 1774; for its business was not protest\r\nbut the reconstruction of a government, and it proved\r\nequal to the task.

The\r\nevent is in the hand of God.\" It was in that spirit that\r\nthe convention had acted. They had not taken measures\r\nto please, but measures to save the country. The\r\nconstitution which they proposed showed by its very\r\nsimplicity and directness the statesmanlike vigor, definiteness,\r\nand consistency of purpose with which it had\r\nbeen conceived and drafted. It conferred upon the\r\nfederal government powers which would make it at\r\nonce strong and independent: the power to tax, the exclusive\r\npower to coin money, the power to maintain an\r\narmy and a navy,--the powers, within its sphere, of a\r\nsupreme and sovereign government. Its laws were to\r\nbe, not advisory, but imperative, and were to operate,\r\nnot upon the States, but directly upon individuals, like\r\nthe laws of any sovereign. It was provided with the\r\nexecutive the Confederation had lacked: a president in\r\nwhose authority should be concentrated the whole administrative\r\nforce of its government. It was to have\r\nits own courts, and in those courts, not in the courts of\r\nthe States, were its powers to be finally determined,\r\nwhenever challenged. The very equality of the States,\r\nthat cardinal principle,--that cardinal defect,--of the\r\nConfederation, was in large part to be done away with.",
  "096.png": "The legislature of the new government, which was to be\r\nno confederation, but a veritable State built upon a federal\r\nprinciple, was to consist of two houses. In one, the\r\nSenate, the States were to be equally represented; but in\r\nthe other and larger house, the House of Representatives,\r\nthe people were to be represented directly, by number,--one\r\nrepresentative for every thirty thousand,--counting\r\nthem within their States, indeed, but not as if they\r\nconstituted separate commonwealths. The new government\r\nwas to regulate commerce, both with foreign\r\nnations and among the States. The States were to be\r\nforbidden to enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;\r\nto emit bills of credit; to pass any law impairing\r\nthe obligation of contracts; and to lay any imposts\r\nor duties on imports or exports, unless permitted to do\r\nso by the Congress of the United States. All foreign\r\naffairs, all questions between State and State, all common\r\ninterests were to be controlled by the federal government;\r\nand it was to act directly, of its own will and\r\ninitiative, through its own officers and its own tribunals.\r\n\r\nIn brief, every salient feature of the existing Confederation\r\nwas in this new instrument of government condemned\r\nand rejected:--the absolute equality of the\r\nStates, the dependence of the general government upon\r\nthem for the execution of the laws and for its very support,\r\nits lack of an executive and of executive powers,\r\nits futile function of mere advice. Even so, the changes\r\nproposed did not satisfy Mr. Hamilton.

He could\r\nwish, he said, that the state governments, as independent\r\npolitical bodies, might be extinguished, or\r\nat any rate entirely subordinated; that the general\r\ngovernment might be given \"complete sovereignty\";\r\nthat the new executive of the nation might hold for\r\nlife, and at least one house of the national legislature\r\nfor a like term, \"or at least during good behavior.\" His\r\nbreeding was not of the colonies, his thinking marked\r\nhim of the culture that belonged on the other side of the\r\nsea.

His plain,\r\nstraightforward, manly prose seemed with him an instrument\r\nof business. For all it had about it the flavor\r\nof his singular individuality and had an unmistakable\r\ntouch of the nice art of speech upon it, it used everywhere\r\nthe accents of the shop, the street, the lecture\r\nroom, or the council chamber, and had seldom about it\r\nthe free disengagement of letters. The homely saws\r\nand wise maxims of Poor Richard's Almanack had the\r\ntrue flavor of his career, and were as close to practical\r\nexperience as he himself kept all his life through.

Mr. Bland did not\r\nhesitate to speak of Virginia as a \"distinct and independent\r\nstate,\" bound, indeed, in allegiance to England's\r\nking, but not bound to her Parliament; a dominion\r\n\"settled by Englishmen at their own expense,\r\nunder particular stipulations with the crown,\" and entitled\r\nto deal with the crown alone. Mr. Townsend's\r\nActs of 1767 called forth a series of Letters from a\r\nFarmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British\r\nColonies, into which John Dickinson had put the\r\nvery heart of good sense and justice, to support the theory\r\nof liberty to which all America adhered, with an urbanity,\r\na simple grace, a fine, natural power of statement\r\nwhich gave him instant place, on both sides of\r\nthe sea, among famous Americans.\r\n\r\nIt seemed quite in the order of nature that James\r\nOtis and John Adams in Boston should enter the lists\r\nto make themselves champions of the people's side in\r\nsuch an argument; and they wrote as they spoke, with\r\na point and efficacy sure to win attention.

By an act of\r\nthe 24th of September, 1789, it definitively set up the\r\nSupreme Court for which the constitution had provided;\r\ngiving it a membership of six justices, of whom\r\none should be Chief Justice.

It was by common consent\r\nthe chief business of the session to set the finances\r\nof the country effectually to rights and to regulate\r\ncommerce: to give the new Union unquestionable standing\r\nin the markets and the banks of the world. Congress\r\nput itself in these matters under the guidance of\r\nHamilton. The advice given by the young Secretary\r\nwas characteristic alike of his capacity and of the purposes\r\nwhich he entertained with regard to the government.\r\nAnd he declared his views with characteristic\r\ncandor and directness. \"To justify and preserve the confidence\r\nof the most enlightened friends of good government;\r\nto promote the increasing respectability of the\r\nAmerican name; to answer the calls of justice; to restore\r\nlanded property to its due value; to furnish new\r\nresources both to agriculture and commerce; to cement\r\nmore closely the union of the States; to add to their\r\nsecurity against foreign attacks; to establish public\r\norder on the basis of an upright and liberal policy;",

Each of these proposals in turn\r\nCongress acted upon and adopted,--not, of course, at\r\nonce and without debate: only after severe and even\r\nbitter contests, indeed, which ran through two annual\r\nsessions, and by majorities which grew narrower and\r\nnarrower with each vote until they dwindled and were\r\nlost altogether, to be regained again only by an adroit\r\nparliamentary bargain;--but adopted, nevertheless, and\r\nmade the deliberate policy of the government.\r\n\r\nHere was more than conservative men could digest.\r\nEven Madison, who in most things led the houses,\r\nas he had led the constitutional convention, hesitated\r\nand drew back. Jefferson protested, with rising heat,\r\nin the cabinet and out of it. Parties began to gather\r\ndefinite creed and purpose, and divided upon lines\r\nwhich grew more and more fixed and clear. It was\r\nundoubtedly Hamilton's purpose to draw men of wealth\r\nand property to the support of the government by\r\nmeans of his financial measures: to give them definite\r\nreasons for wishing it to succeed, and for determining\r\nto stand by it until it did succeed, building for the government\r\na great backing of interest; and that of itself\r\ncondemned what he did in the eyes of some. It seemed\r\nto make what he proposed legislation for a class:\r\nfor a class which did not always prefer the interests\r\nof communities to its own.

The constitution nowhere\r\nexplicitly gave Congress the right to create a corporation,\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES FRIGATE, 1812\r\n\r\nlike the new Bank of the United States. Hamilton\r\nargued that that right was included under the\r\nclause which gave it power to make all laws which\r\nshould be \"necessary and proper for carrying into\r\nexecution\" the powers specifically granted; because\r\nhe held that the Bank was a necessary financial agent\r\nin the handling of the federal funds.

Many a sign of sharp\r\nreaction gave the Federalist leaders plain warning of\r\nwhat they might expect, should they persist.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson became the real leader of the new party\r\nof opposition, even before he left the cabinet: at first\r\ncovertly, at last openly; giving it the name Democratic\r\nRepublican, which savored of the Rights of Man\r\nand took men's thoughts over sea to the sharp struggle\r\nfor liberty then ablaze in France; giving it also organization\r\nand the spirit of party, like the master of\r\nmen he was,--philosopher and politician in equal compound.\r\nBut Washington accepted the leadership of\r\nHamilton, as Congress did, and for a time nothing\r\ncould withstand the purposes of those who meant to\r\nmake the new government strong, national, and permanent.\r\nWhen two years had gone by (1791) a new\r\nHouse was chosen, and in part a new Senate; but the\r\nFederalists still kept their ascendency in most of the\r\nconstituencies, and the first policy of the government\r\nwas not stayed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile North Carolina (November 21, 1789)",

The vote of the electors was unanimous\r\nin 1792, as it had been in 1789, in choosing him\r\nPresident, and the seventy-seven votes which they cast\r\nfor Mr. John Adams made him Vice President a second\r\ntime by a safe majority.

The war for independence\r\nhad been a democratic upheaval, and its processes had\r\nseriously discredited all government which was not\r\ndirectly of the people. It had made local committees of\r\ncorrespondence the real organs of opinion. Town meetings\r\nand the people's representatives in the provincial\r\nassemblies had originated policy, while it lasted,\r\nwith an almost sovereign freedom of choice and had\r\nkept their sovereignty when the war closed. Almost\r\neverywhere, except in Virginia, a majority of the leading\r\nfamilies and of the professional classes of the colonies\r\nhad thrown their influence against the separation\r\nand independence which the popular leaders demanded;\r\nagainst the trial of an out-and-out people's government\r\nwithout king or parliament or ruling class to moderate\r\nand offset the sway of democracy; and when the end of\r\nthe struggle came those whom the country had been\r\naccustomed to see lead in its commonwealths abandoned\r\nit in extraordinary numbers forever, preferring Canada\r\nand the Indies and the old country over sea, where government\r\nstill kept the form and dignity and aristocratic\r\nflavor to which they were attached.

Mr. Jefferson found men eager to put a\r\ncheck upon them and restrict the new government to a\r\nmore modest scale of power. The minority were only\r\ntemporarily in the saddle. They were permitted to rule\r\nonly because of their vigor and efficiency, and the need\r\nto employ them in order to give definite shape to the\r\ngovernment which they had originated.\r\n\r\nIt was a rural nation which had drawn together\r\ninto this novel union,--a nation without aristocratic\r\nexample now that its connection with England was\r\ncut off; with nothing but its own simple needs, na\u00efve\r\npreferences, and manifest convenience to consider, now\r\nthat it was no longer part of an extended and various\r\nempire. It had been obliged, because convinced by\r\nthe unanswerable arguments of tumult and of ugly\r\nreprisals of State upon State, to set up at its centre a\r\nreal government again, to take the place of the government\r\nover sea from which it had broken away: a\r\ngovernment with an authority of its own which was\r\nlikely to be even more efficacious in holding them together\r\nin a co-operative union than the authority of the\r\nKing and Parliament. But, though opinion had reluctantly\r\nconsented to that, it by no means followed\r\nthat it would consent to see the new government given\r\na scope and vigor such as Mr. Hamilton, with his notoriously\r\nhigh notions of prerogative, wished to confer\r\nupon it. The people could not, it is true, of a sudden\r\nshake off their life-long habit of following those who\r\nhad always seemed their natural leaders.

Under the laws of the colonies only a minority\r\nof the adult male residents in each community had\r\nbeen allowed to vote,--those who held some not inconsiderable\r\namount of property; and still fewer had\r\nbeen allowed to hold office,--the ownership of a still\r\nlarger amount of property being prescribed as a qualification\r\nfor candidates for political office. Most of\r\nthe one-time colonies had transformed themselves into\r\nStates upon their assumption of independence by an\r\nentire reformulation of their fundamental law; and\r\nsome had modified it still further before the new central\r\ngovernment over which General Washington was\r\nto preside had been set up; but the basis of their suffrage\r\nthey had in most cases left substantially unaltered.\r\nIt was still necessary that every voter should be\r\na freeholder, or the possessor of an estate of (say) fifty\r\npounds value, or at the least a tax-payer. Rhode Island\r\nand Connecticut had kept their colonial charters as\r\ntheir State constitutions and left their law substantially\r\nunchanged.

The essential\r\nsimplicity of its life made pretension ridiculous; the\r\nfree movement of enterprise throughout its borders\r\nmade the individual man, with or without property, if\r\nonly he possessed energy and initiative, the real and\r\nonly constant unit of power; and the new nation was\r\nnot long in showing that it wished its government conducted\r\nwith the economy, simplicity, and plainness of\r\nthe individual man. There had been a significant flurry\r\nof excited comment when the first Congress under\r\nthe constitution debated whether in official papers it\r\nshould speak of the President of the United States as\r\n\"His Highness\" or \"His Excellency,\" or confer upon\r\nhim some other title of even greater semblance of rank\r\nand dignity. \"Does the dignity of the nation then\r\nconsist,\" Mr. Tucker, of South Carolina, had cried, \"in\r\nthe exaltation of one man and the humiliation of all the\r\nrest?\" It raised a very storm of angry and even abusive\r\ncomment when the houses voted their first salaries Bill,\r\nwhich gave to the President twenty-five thousand dollars\r\na year, to the Vice President five thousand, to Senators\r\nand Representatives six dollars a day during the\r\nsessions of Congress, and to the Speaker of the House\r\ntwelve dollars. It was known that General Washington\r\nwould decline to draw his salary, and that while he\r\nremained President the salary voted to the chief magistrate\r\nwould be merely nominal; but the bill fixed the\r\nsalary for subsequent incumbents of the office, and it was\r\nvery generally condemned for its wilful extravagance.",

War with\r\nEngland had been avoided, but not war with France.\r\nFrance had hoped for and expected the success of the\r\nJeffersonian Democrats in the elections; the French\r\nminister to the United States had even so far forgotten\r\nhimself as to make a plea in the public prints for the\r\nprinciples and the party of Jefferson, the friend of\r\nFrance, and had uttered thinly veiled threats that the\r\nsuccess of the Federalists in the presidential election\r\nwould lead France to regard America as virtually an\r\nEnglish dependency, to be treated as if as much an enemy\r\nas England herself. The cockade of the French\r\nrepublic became for the nonce the emblem of the partisans\r\nof Mr. Jefferson. The struggle for the presidency\r\nlooked for a little like a game between French\r\nand English for political advantage.

Ever since 1793 she had\r\nbeen seizing American ships and cargoes on the high\r\nseas as she pleased, as freely and with as little regard\r\nfor right as England herself. Her depredations upon\r\nthe commerce of the country had been less serious than\r\nthose of England only because her cruisers were less\r\nnumerous than the English and did not move as freely\r\nupon the seas. Now she quickened her aggressive\r\naction, like a power at war. She even extended her\r\nseizures, searches, and confiscations to the very waters\r\nof the United States themselves. General Washington,\r\nduring the closing months of his term as President, had\r\nrecalled Mr. Monroe, then the minister of the United\r\nStates at Paris, deeming him too much infatuated with\r\nFrench principles, too sentimental a friend of the government\r\nto which he was accredited, to act with proper\r\nvigor. The Directory of the heady republic refused to\r\nreceive any other minister in his place until its grievances\r\nagainst the United States had been redressed.\r\nIts grievances were summed up in America's friendship\r\nfor England, and Mr. Jay's treaty as an earnest\r\nof that friendship.

A separate\r\nnavy Department was created (April 30, 1798);\r\nexisting treaties with France were declared abrogated\r\n(April 7, 1798); American vessels of war were expressly\r\nauthorized to attack French cruisers (July 9, 1798);\r\nand active reprisals were begun.

The President frequently\r\nfound it necessary to act without their knowledge or\r\nassent, in order to act with independence and without\r\nembarrassing interference from outside quarters. He\r\nhad sent the embassy which concluded peace with\r\nFrance without their knowledge or approbation, greatly\r\nto their chagrin and to the deep annoyance of Hamilton,\r\nwhom they deemed their party leader.

That was the\r\nfeeling of the county. It was unjust; it was false; but\r\nit was not without foundation. It was but a crude, undiscriminating\r\nway of interpreting the plain fact, which\r\nMr. Hamilton made hardly a pretence of concealing,\r\nthat the men who had hitherto led the Federalist party\r\nfeared democracy, distrusted it with an ineradicable\r\ndistrust, believed a strong government necessary, which\r\nshould be intrusted to men of the older traditions of\r\npower and of statesmanship received from over sea,\r\ndeemed the English government, if stripped of its abuses,\r\nthe safest model of free institutions, and thought England\r\nthe only European power worth keeping close\r\nfriendship with in international dealings.

On the 13th of February, 1801,\r\nless than three weeks before the day upon which Mr.\r\nJefferson was to become President, they put through\r\nCongress, by a strictly party vote, a Judiciary Act\r\nwhich very considerably enlarged the number of federal\r\ncourts and judges and added some fifty thousand dollars\r\nto the annual judicial budget, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the legal business of the country justified\r\nno such expansion of the federal judicial machinery;\r\nand Mr. Adams hastened to fill the new judgeships,\r\nas well as every other vacant place, great or small,\r\nwith staunch Federalists. On the 31st of January he\r\nhad appointed Mr. John Marshall, of Virginia, Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States, an\r\napproved lawyer, but a tried Federalist, and but just\r\nturned of forty-five. The government of the country\r\npassed into Mr. Jefferson's hands as stoutly fortified\r\nagainst change or misuse as a solidly Federalist\r\npersonnel in the courts could make it.\r\n\r\nThe whole face of affairs, the very aspect of the government\r\nitself, seemed to change when Mr. Jefferson\r\nbecame President. For one thing, the seat of government\r\nwas transferred from Philadelphia, the busy city\r\nand mart of trade, with its seventy thousand inhabitants,",
  "202.png": "to the rural spaces of the new federal District of Columbia.\r\nThe removal had been effected in the summer of\r\n1800, during the closing months of Mr. Adams's administration,\r\nand had suitably marked the exeunt of the\r\nFederalists, the party whose rule had been planned to\r\ndraw about the federal government the support of the\r\nmerchants, the bankers, the property owners, the chief\r\nmen of means and influence in society and affairs, the\r\nmen of the centres of trade, whose interests were larger\r\nthan those of any single State or neighborhood. An\r\nextensive city, to be called \"Washington,\" had been\r\nplotted in the fields and woodlands which lay upon the\r\nnortheastern bank of the Potomac, on the portion of\r\nland which Maryland had ceded for a federal district.\r\nThe building of an official residence for the President\r\nhad been begun in 1792, and the corner-stone of a capital\r\nbuilding had been laid by General Washington in\r\nSeptember, 1793. Some quarters for the executive departments\r\nhad been erected; a few houses had been\r\nbuilt here and there at long intervals upon the projected\r\nstreets of the new city; and speculators had bought\r\nland there in expectation of high prices to come. But\r\nonly one wing of the Capitol was completed when the\r\ngovernment was at last actually transferred. The\r\nCongress had to be temporarily housed. The President's\r\nresidence was the only dwelling of any pretensions\r\nready for occupancy. The streets of the quiet\r\nplace ran through bits of forest, like avenues in a wild\r\nand wooded park, or were lost in open fields, where there\r\nwas neither fence nor dwelling. There were not houses\r\nenough in all the spreading plot of projected avenues\r\nand squares to furnish members lodging during the\r\nsessions of the Congress. Some had to make their",

The stately proportions\r\nof the White House and of the rising Capitol looked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELI WHITNEY\r\n\r\nstrangely enough in such a place.

Here was a\r\nplace for real democracy to be brought in, without show\r\nor circumstance. Mr. Adams set out upon his long ride\r\nhomeward early on the morning of the 4th of March,\r\nhaving no stomach to wait and see Mr. Jefferson take\r\nthe Presidency. The new President, accompanied by a\r\nfew friends, and escorted by a company of Virginian\r\nartillery, as guard of honor, walked quietly from his\r\nboarding house to the Capitol; there took the oath of\r\noffice and read his address to the people; and a new\r\nr\u00e9gime was inaugurated. John Marshall, the new\r\nChief Justice, twelve years his junior, administered the\r\noath; and the two men, as they stood thus face to face,\r\nVirginians both, bred to the same principles of life and\r\ncourtesy, but opposite in every principle of politics,\r\nmust have seemed to give each his silent challenge to\r\nthe future in the act.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy and momentous thing stood revealed\r\nin the simple ceremony. The democratic forces which\r\nhad set the Revolution ablaze, and which had operated\r\nthrough seven years of war and reconstruction to work\r\na radical change in the temper and practice of the whole\r\ncountry in public affairs, now once again reasserted\r\nthemselves and took possession of the seats of government.\r\nThey had been temporarily discredited during\r\nthe troubled years when the Confederation was the\r\nmakeshift government of the country,--discredited by\r\nthe jealousies, the riotous disorders, the gross turbulence\r\nand distempers of the time. The new Union had",

The Federalists' twelve years' labor\r\nof organization had been undertaken and carried forward\r\nwhile the reaction lasted: to make strong the forces\r\nof conservatism, school the people in order and self-restraint,\r\nand make solid once more the foundations of\r\nauthority.

Our peculiar security\r\nis in the possession of a written constitution. Let\r\nus not make it a blank paper by construction.\" But\r\nin the same breath with which he urged his scruple he\r\ndeclared his readiness to abandon it. \"If our friends\r\nthink differently,\" he said, \"certainly I shall acquiesce\r\nwith satisfaction, confiding that the good sense of our",

Nowhere\r\nexcept in New England was there sharp and acrid dissent.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson had given the country its first taste\r\nof his real quality in action.

He wanted as\r\nlittle governing from the federal capital as might be;\r\nbut as much progress as might be, too, and as much\r\naccess of power and of opportunity to the people as\r\na body of free men, unshackled by any too meddling\r\ngovernment.

By a series of Orders in Council\r\n(May, 1806 - April[** ?], 1809) she virtually declared every\r\nport of Europe and the Indies closed against neutral\r\ntrade.

They were simply unprecedented acts\r\nof war in a struggle which had at last transcended\r\nevery rule and standard. But America's trade was\r\nlikely to be cut away at the roots as effectually as if\r\nall Europe had declared war against her. Moreover,\r\nshe was helpless. Mr. Jefferson had brought a party\r\nto power which had dismantled the navy which the\r\nFederalists had begun. The few ships that remained\r\nwere tied up at the docks out of repair, out of commission,\r\nor lacking crews and equipment. English\r\ncruisers overhauled American merchantmen when and\r\nwhere they pleased, looked into their manifests and\r\nbills of lading, forbade them their voyage if they chose,\r\nand took their seamen off to serve in their own crews.\r\n\r\nIt was indisputable English law that a British subject's\r\nallegiance was indefeasible and could not be renounced.\r\nMany a man upon American ships was in\r\nfact a deserter from the British navy, where the pay\r\nwas poor enough and the discipline brutal enough to\r\nmake any man wish for respite and escape. English\r\ncaptains were simply reclaiming runaway Englishmen,\r\ntheir government said.

The bitter and intolerable\r\nthing was, that British officers made no pretence\r\nof investigation; took what men they chose, American\r\nor English, not declining negroes even; and insulted\r\nthe flag of the United States by every method they\r\nemployed. Insult reached its climax when the English\r\ncruiser Leopard followed the American frigate Chesapeake\r\nout of Hampton Roads, fired upon her, and took\r\nfour men from her as deserters,--the Chesapeake having\r\nbut a single gun ready for use (1807).\r\n\r\nNEW YORK ABOUT 1800.[**, ?] FROM THE NORTH\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson saw the face of war in all this, but would\r\nnot propose any means of redress.

The six frigates then kept in commission proved\r\nunsuitable for the service, and he was forced to consent\r\nto the construction of a few vessels more suitable,\r\nwhich promptly brought Tripoli to terms. But he did\r\nnot allow even the Tripolitan war (1802-1805) to bring\r\na real navy into existence.\r\n\r\nHe tried negotiation with England, through Mr.\r\nMonroe and Mr. William Pinkney, for many weary\r\nmonths, and through many changes of ministry over\r\nsea, but could get nothing better than Jay's treaty\r\n(then about to expire by limitation), and would accept\r\nnothing less than a renunciation of the right of search\r\nand of impressment, which England would not relinquish.\r\nWhen the Leopard fired on the Chesapeake\r\nhe ordered all British men-of-war out of American\r\nwaters and forbade them her ports; but there was no\r\nremedy in that. At last, driven to retaliation but unalterably\r\nopposed to war, he recommended an embargo,\r\nwhich should at least make English merchants smart\r\nby cutting off their lucrative trade with the United\r\nStates.",

In January,\r\n1809, in accordance with the recommendations of a\r\nreport from Mr. Gallatin, Congress passed an Enforcing\r\nAct which authorized the President, through the\r\ncollectors of customs, to seize any goods of American\r\ngrowth or manufacture that might be found in any\r\nkind of boat or in any vehicle going towards the sea,\r\nand to hold them until heavy bonds were given that\r\nthey would not be taken out of the United States. At\r\nthat the temper of New England broke down, as the\r\ntemper of Kentucky and Virginia had broken down\r\nunder the Alien and Sedition laws.

The signing of the new measure was almost\r\nthe last official act of Mr. Jefferson's administration.\r\nOn the 4th of March, with no slight sense of relief,\r\nhe handed over to Mr. Madison the responsibilities of\r\nhis great office,--a burden which increased, as he had\r\nfound, from year to year.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison had been chosen without difficulty to",

But it turned out that the young minister\r\nhad acted without authority. He was recalled,\r\nthe Act was again put into force against England\r\n(August 9.[**replace with ,] 1809), and affairs looked uglier than ever.\r\n\r\nThen Napoleon practised anew upon the credulity\r\nof the Administration. On May 1, 1810, Congress formally\r\nrepealed the Non-Intercourse Act, which would\r\nhave expired by limitation at the close of the session\r\nwithout repeal, and authorized the President, in case\r\neither Great Britain or France should \"cease to violate\r\nthe neutral commerce of the United States,\" to revive\r\nand enforce non-intercourse with the other, should she\r\nfail to do the same. Napoleon promised that his decrees\r\nagainst American shipping should be revoked\r\non the 1st of the following November, provided England\r\nwould before that date withdraw her Orders in\r\nCouncil. England replied that she would rescind the\r\nOrders when informed that the Emperor had revoked his\r\ndecrees. The Emperor sent word to Mr. Madison that\r\nhis decrees were in fact revoked, and should cease to\r\nhave effect after the 1st of November, if in the mean\r\ntime the United States should \"cause their rights to\r\nbe respected by England.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt what that meant: non-intercourse\r\nwith England as the price and condition of release",

It had pledged itself to believe\r\nthat France had in good faith yielded to its demands.\r\nEngland made no pretence of having yielded or of intending\r\nto yield. Evidence multiplied that France was\r\nplaying a double and lying part. Mr. Madison's mortification\r\nwas complete and very bitter; but no one\r\ndeemed it possible that the United States should fight\r\nboth France and England at once. Men's minds were\r\nslowly made up to stomach France's deceptions and\r\nfight England. At least it was so with the President,\r\nwho saw no way of retreat not too humiliating to be\r\nborne; and it was so with Congress, which had passed\r\nunder the control of new leaders.\r\n\r\nAn air of radical action began to stir the moment\r\nCongress assembled (November 4, 1811). It was the\r\nfirst session of the Twelfth Congress. In the House\r\nseventy members, out of a total of one hundred and\r\nforty-one, were new men, and for the most part young\r\nmen: their leaders young men like themselves. Most\r\nconspicuous among them was Henry Clay, a man not\r\nyet turned thirty-five, whose tall and striking figure,\r\neasy way of comradeship among men, free and ringing\r\neloquence in speech, and ready mastery in the battle of\r\ndebate gave him an engaging pre-eminence, which no\r\nman without an equal charm and power could dispute\r\nwith him. There was something in the whole make-up",

And yet there was an art, a winning\r\npersuasiveness, a reverence for old ideals, a flavor of\r\nold principles in all that he did and said which seemed\r\na reminiscence of his birth in Virginia, where tradition",

Calhoun, the new member from\r\nSouth Carolina, a young man not yet thirty, who showed\r\nin every piece of business he handled a maturity like\r\nthat of the young statesmen of the constitutional convention.\r\nThere was the air of the scholar and student\r\nabout him. His luminous sentences, uttered in\r\ndebate, shone upon every matter they touched with\r\nsingular steadiness and with a light at once vivid and\r\ndiffused, disclosing the distant view no less than the\r\nthing at hand. A strain of passion and of quiet energy\r\nshowed in him which caught the imagination and\r\ntouched the purpose of those about him. It was inevitable\r\nthat these men should lead,--these and the other\r\nmen of the new age who stood with them and were of\r\nlike principle and purpose: in the House, Langdon\r\nCheves and William Lowndes, of South Carolina; Richard\r\nM. Johnson, of Kentucky; Peter Buel Porter, of\r\nNew York; and in the Senate, William H. Crawford,\r\nof Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay was chosen Speaker and organizer of the\r\nHouse, and it proceeded to the business which led to\r\nwar. These men had made up their minds that the country\r\nshould fight. The President could not but take\r\ntheir purpose, having no alternative to suggest. The\r\ntangle of French diplomacy could not be straightened\r\nout, the stubbornness of England could not be budged:\r\nthe country, as if by hereditary choice, chose to fight\r\nEngland and let France go her way for the present.\r\nThe grounds of the war were singularly uncertain.\r\nFrance was doing much more to injure neutral trade\r\nthan England was.

Every American sailor went about\r\nwith a certificate of citizenship which described his\r\n\"eyes and nose and mouth and chin, the color of his\r\nhair and complexion, and the marks and scars about\r\nhis person,--like the advertisement of a runaway\r\nslave,\"--and yet was not safe. Actual outrages often\r\naccompanied the ceaseless impressments, and only\r\nthe embargo, which kept ships in port, had thrown\r\nthe matter for a little into the background. But it\r\nhad been thrown into the background. Mr. Jefferson\r\nhad let it go almost without protest since his commissioners\r\nhad failed to induce England to abandon it. It\r\nwas now clearly an afterthought as a ground for war.\r\nThere was no excitement in the country; only a vague\r\nirritation and fretfulness. But the drift had set in,\r\nand the majority went with it, dragging the country.\r\nIn April, 1812, an embargo was enacted, preparatory\r\nto war; and on the 18th of June war was declared. The\r\nvery day before (June 17th) the English Parliament\r\nhad repealed the Orders in Council. The change of\r\nmind and of policy long looked for in England had\r\ncome at last, and the cause of the war was taken away\r\non the very eve of its outbreak.\r\n\r\nIt was a foolhardy and reckless risk the Congress\r\nwas taking. The country had been \"embargoed and\r\nnon-intercoursed almost into a consumption,\" as Mr.\r\nRandolph said, very passionately. It was certainly\r\nno time for battle. The party in power had relied on\r\nembargoes and non-intercourse and had disbanded\r\nthe army. The revenues of the government were",

Napoleon was\r\nthe enemy of the civilized world, had been America's\r\nown enemy in disguise, and had thrown off the disguise.\r\nEngland was fighting him almost alone, all\r\nEurope thrown into his scale and hers almost kicking\r\nthe beam; and now America had joined the forces of\r\nNapoleon, in fact if not in intention, as he had subtilely\r\nplanned. It was natural that the raw and rural",

England's policy had cut America to\r\nthe quick and had become intolerable, and it did not\r\nlessen America's exasperation that that policy had\r\nbeen a measure of war against the Corsican, not against\r\nher. It was a tragical but natural accident that the\r\nwar should be against England, not against France.\r\n\r\nTHE PORT OF BUFFALO, 1815\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the New England Federalists saw the\r\nwar; but they deemed the accident inexcusable and\r\npressed their opposition almost to the verge of treason.\r\nThe trade of the shipping ports had of course suffered\r\nimmensely at the hands of both England and Napoleon.\r\nBut the profits of the neutral carrier were enormous,\r\nnevertheless, in that troubled time. Such ships\r\nas escaped seizure and made good their voyage recouped\r\ntheir owners for many lost.

Once again, when the embargo came, the\r\nopposition of New England became factious and desperate.\r\nIt spread to New York, which passed from the\r\ncontrol of a Republican to the control of a Federalist\r\nmajority. It threatened hopelessly to embarrass the\r\ngovernment, if not to jeopard its very existence.\r\n\r\nThe course of the war did little to improve matters.\r\nThe government had neither the means nor the organization\r\nto conduct it. The President was authorized\r\nto increase the regular army from six to twenty-five\r\nthousand men, to call for fifty thousand volunteers,\r\nand to employ one hundred thousand men from the\r\nmilitia of the States. But volunteers were not to be\r\nhad for the asking; and officers were even harder to\r\nfind than men. The governors of Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nand New Hampshire, though they would not\r\nforbid recruiting, refused to permit the use of their organized\r\nmilitia outside the limits of their States, thinking\r\nthemselves legally justified by the terms of the constitution,\r\nwhich authorized Congress to provide for\r\ncalling forth the militia only \"to execute the laws of\r\nthe Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions,\"\r\nand said nothing of a war like this.

Finding no opposing force to attack, their\r\ncrews made frequent descents upon defenceless settlements,\r\nwhich they burned and plundered.

  "270.png": "\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCRITICAL CHANGES\r\n\r\nA CRITICAL presidential election had marked the\r\nvery outset of the war. Mr. Madison had, no doubt,\r\nbeen Mr. Jefferson's lieutenant and chosen successor,\r\nand had meant to walk in his footsteps, preserving\r\npeace at the price of embargoes and domestic agitation,\r\nand keeping the federal government in the background,\r\neven though it should cost it its strength and prestige.\r\nBut there had been men of his own party from the first\r\nwho earnestly objected to the succession, wishing a\r\nleader of a different temperament and fibre. \"We ask\r\nfor energy,\" they said, \"and we are told of his moderation;\r\nwe ask for talent, and the reply is, his unassuming\r\nmerit.\" The very war itself had come because Mr.\r\nMadison and his cabinet, like Mr. Jefferson and those\r\nwho counselled him, had nothing to suggest, whatever\r\nwrong was wrought upon them,--except to withdraw\r\nfrom the seas, close the ports, build gunboats to\r\ndefend the harbors, and wait until the inevitable should\r\nbe at hand. While they waited every condition of national\r\npolitics shifted and was altered, and watchful\r\nmen who wished for action had grown deeply uneasy.\r\n\r\nSixteen years of Jeffersonian supremacy had culminated\r\nin a war which was against all Jeffersonian\r\nprinciples, and there had come about, while no one",
  "271.png": "planned, an unlooked for disorder of parties, a bewildering\r\nreversal of parts in every matter of policy. In June,\r\n1813, Mr. Josiah Quincy, no Jeffersonian, but a Federalist,\r\nprofessing to be of the school of Washington and\r\nHamilton, had moved, in the legislature of Massachusetts,\r\nthat \"in a war like the present, waged without\r\njustifiable cause and prosecuted in a manner which in-*\r\n\r\nJOSIAH QUINCY",
  "272.png": "*dicates that conquest and ambition are its real motives,\r\nit is not becoming a moral and religious people to express\r\nany approbation of military or naval exploits which\r\nare not immediately connected with the defence of our\r\nsea-coasts and soil,\"--words which rang true to the earlier\r\ntones of Jeffersonian profession. The young leaders\r\nof the new Republican Congress, on the other hand,\r\nJeffersonian Republicans though they professed to be,\r\nhad pressed the war forward in the spirit, if not with\r\nthe method, which had been Washington's and Hamilton's.\r\nMr. Madison was not their real party head.\r\nOnly eighty-three of the one hundred and thirty-three\r\nRepublican senators and representatives attended the\r\ncongressional caucus which gave him his nomination\r\nfor a second term (May, 1812); and he won the election\r\nonly by the vote of Pennsylvania. Mr. De Witt Clinton,\r\nof New York, Republican though he was, had\r\nput himself forward as an independent candidate, had\r\ncarried New York with him into opposition, had received\r\nthe support of the Federalists, desperate for success,\r\nand had been voted for by the electors of every northern\r\nState except Pennsylvania and Vermont. Mr. Madison\r\nhad received the solid support of the South and the\r\nvotes of Vermont and Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's\r\ntwenty-five electoral votes had decided the election\r\n(128-89). Parties were breaking up, and Mr. Madison's\r\npersonality was not strong enough to hold his own\r\nparty together. It had been a hazardous test of party\r\nallegiance with which to begin a war.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the war was over and Mr. Madison's\r\neventful second term at an end, there had been another\r\nchoice of President which seemed to go by rule of thumb\r\nrather than by the real preference of those who guided",

Mr. Monroe received the succession,--not because\r\nof his personal force or because of any gift of\r\nleadership discoverable in him, but because, by long\r\npublic service and by intimate association with the\r\nleaders of his party, he had made his way into the inner",

Virginia, one of the most populous and\r\ninfluential States of the Union, was the Republican\r\nparty's centre of gravity. Her public men, with twenty-five\r\nelectoral votes behind them, dominated Republican\r\nparty counsels; and Mr. Monroe was their choice\r\nfor fourth Virginian President. His nomination was\r\ncarried in caucus, it is true, only by the narrow margin\r\nof eleven votes over Mr. Crawford, of Georgia; but, that\r\ninitial victory won, the presidency followed as of course.\r\nMr. Madison had shown himself a statesman rather\r\nin the framing of institutions and the formulation of\r\nlaw than in the government of events. Mr. Monroe,\r\nwithout his studious comprehension of principles, stood\r\nfor at least a like experience in affairs. The country, it\r\nseemed, was not yet ready for younger men, and there\r\nwas no party set against him that could defeat him.\r\nThe Federalists knew themselves discredited. What with\r\ntheir factious support of Mr. Clinton, who had never\r\navowed any principle which they could pretend was\r\ntheir own, and the ugly threat of the Hartford convention,--their\r\nloss of principle in following the men\r\nthey did follow and the openly avowed disunionist principles\r\nof the one-time leaders whom they did not follow,--the\r\ncountry at large had turned from them in contempt\r\nand deep distaste. Their electoral vote fell off\r\nto thirty-four again: the votes of Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nand Delaware.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was a fortunate choice which preferred\r\nMr. Monroe at such a time.

  "275.png": "*ties were finding themselves and making ready for a\r\nnew age. That the new President was no master of\r\nmen had become evident enough while he was a member\r\nof Mr. Madison's cabinet. He had accepted the Secretaryship\r\nof State in April, 1811, with the avowed intention\r\nof extricating the country from the entanglements\r\ninto which Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison had\r\nsuffered it to be drawn; but the dark tide of perplexed\r\ndiplomacy which swirled about the Napoleonic wars,\r\nand which had overwhelmed Mr. Madison, had caught\r\nhim also in its fatal drift, and he had become Mr.\r\nMadison's comrade merely, not his guide. He lacked\r\noriginative strength, but not sound character; he fell\r\nshort of the equipment of a statesman, but not of the\r\nequipment of an upright and serviceable public officer.\r\nHe was able, his colleagues found, \"to keep important\r\nmatters steadily under his attention until he had mastered\r\nthem and could form his judgment accurately\r\nconcerning them\"; and looked into his duties with \"a\r\nmind of capital integrity and ingenuous honesty.\"\r\nWithout the social gift to preside with grace, he brought\r\ndignity and good temper to his task, and the safe traditions\r\nof an elder school in politics.\r\n\r\nWhile he steadily held the government to its accepted\r\nand established mode of action and of growth, many\r\nthings disclosed themselves in the life of the country,\r\nand politics moved forward to a new order. Hitherto\r\nthe country had known the leadership only of New\r\nEngland and the South, regions peopled straight out\r\nof the Old World: the one ruled by a professional aristocracy\r\nof ministers and lawyers, the other by a social\r\nand proprietary aristocracy of land owners; both governed,\r\nalike in thought and action, by old traditions",
  "276.png": "and both smacking, whatever their professions of democratic\r\nprinciple upon occasion, of an old-world taste for\r\nprivilege and for the authority of a trained, experienced,\r\ndisciplined minority. But since the new century opened\r\nand Mr. Adams gave place to Mr. Jefferson new\r\nStates had come crowding faster and faster into the\r\nUnion, and came crowding still: Ohio (1802), Louisiana\r\n(1812), Indiana (1816), Mississippi (1817), Illinois (1818),\r\nAlabama (1819); most of them springing up in the\r\nfar valley of the Mississippi, where new communities\r\nbred a new air and the sap of a new nation was rising.\r\nTransplantation thither seemed to create a new race,--not\r\nthe mere offspring of New England or the South,\r\nnot mixed or compounded of the two in such ways as\r\nto reproduce the East, not moulded from the Old World,\r\nnot homogeneous even, but full of racy elements united\r\nin a new and free combination, more like New York\r\nand Pennsylvania than like Virginia or Massachusetts,\r\nand yet different also from these, with a flavor and\r\nspirit distinctively its own.\r\n\r\nThe country was at last in a position to feel at their\r\nfull these forces from within, and to respond to them\r\nquickly and naturally. By the mastery of Wellington\r\nand Bl\u00fccher at Waterloo (June 18, 1815) Europe had found\r\npeace again. For the first time since the Revolution\r\nin France, since the setting up of the federal government\r\nin America, the seas were cleared of hostile armaments.\r\nQuestions of impressment and of the rights of neutral\r\ncarriers at sea fell quietly out of sight amidst a general\r\npeace. Every strain was eased, and the young state\r\nin the West, which the great storm of war over sea,\r\nspreading blackly from continent to ocean till it seemed\r\nto fill the world, had at last touched and tested, could",

TOMPKINS\r\n\r\nPeace changed the very face of trade. American skippers\r\nno longer had the lucrative advantage of commanding\r\nthe only vessels free to pass from port to port\r\namidst a world at war. There was, indeed, still plenty\r\nof carrying to be done at sea. Crops fell short in Europe",
  "278.png": "after the scourge of war, and America filled all the ships\r\nshe could get with grain for the markets over sea. English\r\nmerchants poured their goods once again into the\r\nAmerican ports, so long shut against them by embargoes\r\nand war. But seamen of every nation could compete\r\nfor the trade, and the Yankee skipper had no longer\r\nany advantage except such as his wit and sea-bred fitness\r\ngave him.\r\n\r\nThe very freedom with which trade moved, besides,\r\naltered the attitude of the country towards it. Manufactures\r\nhad sprung up while the ports were closed.\r\nThe very ship owners of the trading ports had in many\r\ninstances sold their craft and put their capital into the\r\nmanufacture of such things as were most immediately\r\nneeded for the home market. By the year 1815 close\r\nupon fifty million dollars had been invested in the manufacture\r\nof textile fabrics alone. In 1808, when feeling\r\nran so hot in the East over the embargo, there were\r\nbut eight thousand spindles employed in the manufacture\r\nof cotton, and only some fifteen hundred bales\r\nof cotton per year were needed to supply them; but in\r\n1815 there were five hundred thousand, and ninety thousand\r\nbales of cotton were used within the year to keep\r\nthem busy. In 1814 Mr. Francis Lowell, of Boston,\r\nhad set up at Waltham the first factory ever established\r\nin which every process in the manufacture of cotton,\r\nfrom the cleansing and carding of the raw material to\r\nthe weaving of the cloth, was carried through under\r\na single roof, each step intelligently and economically\r\nco\u00f6rdinated and fitted to the next. The secret of the\r\npower loom successfully put into operation in England\r\nin 1806 had been very jealously and carefully\r\nguarded by its inventors, but Mr. Lowell, with the",

The manufacture of wool\r\nand flax and hemp and even silk was added. The\r\nmachinery which could not be bought in England was\r\n\r\nCUMBERLAND GAP, NEAR WHEELING, VIRGINIA\r\n\r\nmade in America. Iron manufactures, long ago set\r\nup but tentative and feeble hitherto, increased from\r\nhundreds of thousands to millions in value under the\r\nstimulation of foreign trade cut off. Hides and skins\r\nwere extensively prepared; liquors were distilled and\r\nfermented from the abounding grain and fruits of the\r\ncountry-sides; glass, earthenware, furniture, almost\r\neverything that was in general use in the country,",
  "282.png": "was sooner or later added to the growing list. Industries\r\nlong ago begun upon a small scale took heart to\r\ngrow, and those which Americans had hitherto not\r\ndreamed of attempting were hardily embarked upon.\r\nDistinct manufacturing regions began sensibly to develop\r\nin the middle States and in the East, with interests\r\nand characteristics which statesmen could not\r\nafford to overlook.\r\n\r\nIt was manifestly a menace to every young industry\r\nthat a flood of English imports should continue to pour\r\ninto the country at the open ports. The remedy was a\r\nprotective tariff, such as Mr. Hamilton had wished to\r\nsee at the first; and the young Republican leaders of\r\nCongress did not hesitate to advocate and establish\r\nit (April, 22, 1816). Mr. Madison himself favored and\r\neven urged it, as he had favored and urged also the\r\nre-establishment of the national bank. Western members\r\nof Congress supported it because they wanted and\r\ncould get duties on flax and hemp. Every State in\r\nthe Union except Delaware and North Carolina was\r\nrepresented by at least one member in the vote which\r\nestablished it. Men of the most diverse views and\r\ninterests united in wishing to give the country not only\r\npolitical but also economic independence. Mr. Clay\r\nurged that it ought to be put into a position to develop\r\nevery resource that could serve it or make it powerful\r\nin time of war. The duties imposed were not high:\r\ntwenty-five per cent. upon cotton and woollen goods,\r\nand upon other manufactured goods in proportion.\r\nBut the duties on cottons and woollens were made very\r\nformidable, as it turned out, by a provision that in no\r\ncase should they amount to less than six and a quarter\r\ncents a yard. At the very outset that represented",
  "283.png": "a tax of more than twenty-five per cent. on the coarse\r\ngoods which the southern planters bought for the use\r\nof their slaves; and as the processes of manufacture\r\ncheapened this fixed minimum represented, of course,\r\na larger and larger fraction of the price. It was pretty\r\nsure in the end to become an effectual barrier against\r\nall foreign competition.\r\n\r\nThe men who planned these things saw also the danger\r\nof mere development, the risk in growth itself, unless\r\nthe country, with its long coast and scattered settlements,\r\nspreading more and more upon the unlimited\r\nspaces of the great continent, were in some way bound\r\ntogether by easy means of intercourse and union. It\r\nhad been found next to impossible to handle armies\r\nin the northern forests during the war, or in the long\r\nwilderness which lay upon the lower Mississippi between\r\nthe Atlantic settlements and the Gulf: difficult\r\nto handle them anywhere at the heart of the country,\r\neven amidst the oldest settlements,--for lack of roads\r\nor any open way of transport except where rivers or\r\nthe lakes themselves lay like highways. The troops\r\nhad been time and again likely to starve, not because\r\nthere was not food enough to be had upon the order of\r\nthe government, but because it could not be got to them.\r\nThe commissary had infinitely more difficult duties\r\nthan the general in command. Great highways were\r\nneeded, alike for war time and for times of peace, and a\r\nsystem of canals cut from watercourse to watercourse.\r\nMr. Gallatin had outlined what ought to be done so\r\nlong ago as April, 1808, in a forcible report to Congress,\r\nplanning a whole scheme of intercommunication\r\nwith all his wide-eyed, statesmanlike sagacity in such\r\nmatters; but Mr. Jefferson, though he felt nothing",
  "284.png": "less than enthusiasm for the Secretary's plan, had\r\ndemanded first a constitutional amendment to make it\r\nlegal. Mr. Gallatin's broad purpose of \"internal improvements\"\r\nupon a national scale and at the nation's\r\nexpense slumbered, therefore, until the Congress came\r\nwhich the young Republicans led who made war on\r\nEngland. Then (December, 1816) Mr. Calhoun, of\r\nSouth Carolina, proposed that the million and a half\r\ndollars which the new national bank had paid the\r\ngovernment for its privileges should be set aside as a\r\nfund \"for constructing roads and canals and improving\r\nthe navigation of watercourses.\" But, though the\r\nbill passed, Mr. Madison vetoed it, entertaining Mr.\r\nJefferson's scruples in the matter; and for a little while\r\nlonger the plan was put aside.

But\r\nfor anything more than this the time was not yet quite\r\nripe.\r\n\r\nThe new national principles of the Republican leaders\r\nfound fuller scope and a wider application in affairs\r\nwhen Mr. Monroe became President,--not so much\r\nbecause of any change from the old order of thinking\r\nin Mr. Monroe himself, as because events overruled\r\nparty creeds and made their own terms with abstract\r\nprinciples. Subtly, insensibly, by an alchemy whose\r\nprocesses no man knew or guided, the transformations\r\nof growth were becoming also transformations\r\nof character in the young body politic of the Union.\r\nYoung men, and men not hitherto looked to for leadership,\r\nwere pushing themselves to the front. Mr. Madison\r\nhad already called Mr. Crawford, of Georgia, one of\r\nthe new group of congressional leaders, into his cabinet,\r\nand Mr. Monroe retained him as Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nHe called Mr. Calhoun, of South Carolina, to\r\nthe Secretaryship of War.

It was found when\r\nthe census of 1820 came to be taken that the total population\r\nof the country had increased from 7,215,791 to\r\n9,638,191 within the decade. Twenty thousand immigrants\r\nhad come in at the ports the year Mr. Monroe\r\nbecame President (1817).

It startled him, Mr. Jefferson said,\r\n\"like a fire-bell in the night.\" It arose out of the application\r\nof the Territory of Missouri to be admitted\r\nto the Union (March 6, 1818). Missouri had been settled\r\nout of the South; slave owners had followed the\r\nhardy first settlers thither; and now they asked leave\r\nto come into the Union as a State with the institution\r\nof slavery secured to them in their constitution. Here\r\nwas a question which aroused passion and challenged\r\nprinciple upon the instant,--an issue between the North,\r\nwhich had rejected slavery, and the South, whose industries\r\nand whose very social order were founded\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nSouthern statesmen had dominated the counsels of\r\nthe ruling party of the nation these sixteen years and\r\nmore.

The broad stretches of the great\r\nState of New York, themselves but half peopled and\r\nfull of fair regions inviting to settlement, lay between\r\nNew England and the far-away valleys where new\r\nStates were to be built; the unoccupied forests of Maine\r\nwere near at hand and easy of access at the north;\r\nmany a tract within the borders of New England's own\r\nlittle commonwealths still awaited occupation and development.\r\nBy special effort an \"Ohio Company,\" organized\r\nin Massachusetts by veterans of the Revolution,\r\nhad sent bands of settlers out of New England to lands\r\nwhich it had purchased and reserved upon the northern\r\nbank of the great river the French had coveted, and\r\nlittle hamlets of their making had sprung up there\r\nand flourished.

Kentuckians had constituted the chief\r\npart of the rough-and-ready muster which beat the\r\nEnglish and Tecumseh's braves, their allies, at the\r\nThames by Lake St. Clair, to make safe the northwestern\r\nborder in the war of 1812.

It\r\nwas they who crowded first across the great streams\r\nat their front into Indiana, of which they had been prompt\r\nto make a State in 1816; into Illinois, presently to be\r\nadmitted (December, 1818); and into Missouri, which\r\nthey now insistently asked leave to bring in.

That Ordinance was still the law\r\nof the land. It forbade slavery forever. The pioneers\r\nwho had pressed across the Ohio from the south, to\r\nmake the new commonwealths now established there,\r\nhad been promptly followed by men out of the older\r\nsettlements behind them, out of Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, and out of the long-settled neighborhoods of\r\nKentucky and Tennessee themselves.

Nine out of the fifteen States which took part in\r\nthe second election of General Washington chose their\r\nelectors through their legislatures; only six gave the\r\npeople any direct part in the choice. In the election\r\njust decided by the vote of the House, on the contrary,\r\nthe electors had been chosen by the direct vote of\r\nthe people in eighteen out of the twenty-four States of\r\nthe Union.

But Mr. Clay lacked the unhesitating boldness\r\nand audacity loved on the frontier; had the address\r\nof the careful politician; brought his free and telling\r\neloquence to the service of old ideals, merely quickened\r\nby new affairs; was not wholly of the West.

No one knew or asked General Jackson's\r\nopinions. His friends put him forward, not as a thinker\r\nor even as an organizer of parties, but simply as a man,\r\nwhom the nation could trust: a man with rugged strength\r\nenough to break the old order in politics, now grown\r\nartificial, and inaugurate a new, under which the people,\r\nwhose child and type he was, should come to their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThat was the significance of the ninety-nine electoral\r\nvotes cast for General Jackson in 1825. It was a bitter\r\nthing to bear, his supporters found, to see Mr. Adams\r\npreferred before him, and Mr. Clay's support given, out of\r\nthe West itself, to the candidate of an eastern minority,--so\r\nbitter that they protested in their anger against\r\nthe constitution itself, which made the thing possible:\r\nagainst any law, though it were the fundamental law\r\nof the land, which could thus restrain and defeat \"the\r\nwill of the people.\" Their bitterness turned to malice\r\nwhen Mr. Adams asked Mr. Clay to become Secretary\r\nof State under the new administration and Mr. Clay\r\nconsented. There was here, they said, palpable evidence\r\nof a bargain, an office given for an office received,\r\na self-seeking combination to keep the people's candidate\r\nout,--\"a coalition,\" exclaimed John Randolph,\r\nwith bitter jest, \"unheard of until now, of the Puritan\r\nand the blackleg.\" The charge was shown to be absolutely\r\ngroundless.

Knowing his own convictions\r\nto be honest and formed without selfishness,\r\nhe took their wisdom and their reasonableness for\r\ngranted, and believed every one who held opinions opposed\r\nto them to be moved by some sort of public or\r\nprivate malice. He had declined at first to let his name\r\nbe used in connection with the presidency, deeming\r\nhimself old at fifty-four (1821), feeling ill from the effects\r\nof the hardships he had undergone in Florida, and believing\r\nhimself unfit for the office. But, candidacy once\r\nundertaken, his passion played along every line of emotion\r\nand conviction opened by the novel business, as if\r\nhe were again in the field with troops, and his friends\r\nwere themselves at a loss how to govern him.\r\n\r\nIt had needed such a striking personality as this to\r\nbring parties to a head.

In 1815 Mr. Monroe, then Secretary\r\nof State, had succeeded in obtaining from England\r\nthe right of trade with the British West Indies, in\r\nwhich, the ports once open, American merchants and\r\nskippers easily gained a virtual monopoly; but in 1825,\r\nwhen that agreement lapsed, England changed her\r\npolicy, opened the West Indian ports to all the world\r\non terms which put the United States at a disadvantage,\r\nand, because the United States did not, within a year\r\nset, accept the new arrangement, flatly refused so much\r\nas to open the matter again for negotiation (1826).\r\nCongress, not Mr. Adams, had been at fault; but the\r\ncountry, indifferent to him at best, made no inquiry\r\ninto details: remembered only that he had failed to\r\nsecure the invaluable West Indian trade.\r\n\r\nThe party contests of those barren years of divided\r\ncounsel turned chiefly upon the tariff and upon the\r\nquestion of internal improvements.

To again enter the field of argument, and attempt\r\nmore fully or forcibly to expose the unconstitutionality\r\nof those obnoxious laws, would, it is apprehended, be as\r\nunnecessary as unavailing.

Whether the like decency\r\nand temper have been observed in the answers of most of\r\nthose States who have denied or attempted to obviate the\r\ngreat truths contained in those resolutions, we have now\r\nonly to submit to a candid world.
