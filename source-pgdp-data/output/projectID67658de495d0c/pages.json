In\r\nthis endeavour, and in their own sphere, they\r\nare but followers of the highest example in the\r\nland.

  "007.png": "\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI. The Origin of the Book\r\n\r\nTHE Hsiao Ching, or Book of Filial Duty, is\r\ngenerally held to be the work of an unknown\r\npupil of Ts\u00eang Ts'an, the disciple of\r\nConfucius, to whom is attributed the famous\r\nConfucian classic known as The Greater Learning.\r\nCertainly it can be traced back as far as 400 B.C.,\r\nwithin a century from the death of Confucius.\r\nThe preservation of the text in its present form\r\nis due to the Emperor Ming Huang (A.D. 685-762),\r\none of the most fascinating characters in\r\nChinese history, who had it engraved, together\r\nwith eleven other of the Confucian writings, on\r\ntablets of stone and set up in his capital of\r\nChang-an. He afterwards added a commentary\r\nof his own, which is still extant, and has proved\r\ninvaluable to all commentators of a later period.\r\nThe Book of Filial Duty is often found in China\r\nbound up with another treatise called the Hsiao\r\nHs\u00fceh, or Teaching for the Young, of which the",
  "008.png": "following is a specimen: \"The way to become\r\na student is with meekness and humility, receiving\r\nwith confidence every word spoken by\r\nthe master. The pupil, when he sees men of\r\nvirtue, should try to follow in their steps; when\r\nhe hears wise sayings, he should try to conform\r\nto them. He must not harbour evil designs,\r\nbut always act honourably. Whether at home\r\nor abroad, he must have a fixed abode, and resort\r\nwith those who are well disposed, regulating his\r\ndemeanour with care, and curbing the passions.\"\r\n\r\nFew books have enjoyed greater popularity\r\namongst all classes in China than The Book of\r\nFilial Duty. It may be called The Book of Emperors,\r\nfrom the fact that so many Emperors,\r\nboth before and after Ming Huang, have commentated\r\nupon it. Equally it is The Book of\r\nYouth, being the first treatise of importance\r\nplaced in the hands of children, after the horn\r\nbooks of elementary instruction. The reason\r\nfor its survival after so many centuries is not\r\nhard to seek. Family life has always been, from\r\ntime immemorial, the foundation-stone of the\r\nChinese Empire, and filial piety is the foundation-stone\r\nof family life. Nor does this duty of son\r\nto father merely extend to the living.  The\r\nliving head of the family pays due reverence to\r\nthe countless ancestors who have preceded him.\r\nA witty Chinese writer once remarked that in\r\nthe West family life only began after death--*",
  "009.png": "*in the family vault. Here, at any rate, after\r\nyears of separation and divided interests, the\r\nmembers met to enjoy a common oblivion. I\r\ncannot but think that there is some exaggeration\r\nin this; yet not even the greatest apologist of\r\nWestern methods will venture to deny that the\r\nChinese and indeed most Oriental ideals of family\r\nlife are superior to his own. Whilst living, only\r\nthe calls of Empire, or the demands of their\r\nprofession, may keep relations apart; but the\r\ninterests of the family are always greater than\r\nthe interests of the individual, and no exile is\r\nwithout hope of return to the home of his fathers.\r\nThe dead will not be forgotten, for it will be the\r\nduty of their sons to offer sacrifice to their shades.\r\nThe death-days of two generations of parents\r\nare kept sacred with solemn festival, and the\r\nnameless and unnumbered dead have their\r\nspecial days of ceremony and remembrance in\r\nthe spring and autumn. Every house has its\r\nfamily shrine, every village its hall of ancestors.\r\nThus the filial piety of the survivors honours\r\nthose who have gone.\r\n\r\nAs regards the living, respect is the great\r\nessential of daily intercourse. The subject respects\r\nhis emperor, the son his father, the\r\nwife her husband, and the younger brother his\r\nelder brother. But respect is not only for those\r\nolder than ourselves, or of superior station. The\r\nwisdom of Confucius is nowhere more clearly",
  "010.png": "shown than in his utterance concerning the\r\nrespect to be paid to youth: \"A youth is to be\r\nregarded with respect. How do we know that\r\nhis future will not be equal to our present? If\r\nhe reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not\r\nmade himself heard of, then he will indeed not\r\nbe worthy of respect.\"\r\n\r\nMaxima debetur pueris reverentia!\r\n\r\nThe Chinese national spirit is a spirit of continuity;\r\nthe spirit of the Confucian philosophy\r\nis a spirit of harmony with the environment of\r\ndaily life. \"Confucius,\" says Tz[)u]-ss[)u],\"possessed,\r\nas if by hereditary transmission, the virtues\r\nof Yao and Shun [Emperors of the Golden Age],\r\nand modelled himself on W\u00ean and Wu [first King\r\nof the Chou dynasty, 1133 B.C.] as his exemplars.\r\nAbove all, he kept in unison with the seasons of\r\nthe sky; below, he conformed to the water and\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n\"We may liken him unto the sky and earth in\r\nrespect of the universality with which they\r\nuphold and sustain things, the universality with\r\nwhich they overspread and enfold things. We\r\nmay liken him unto the four seasons in respect\r\nof their varied march; unto the sun and moon\r\nin respect of their alternate shining.\r\n\r\n\"All things are kept in train together without\r\ntheir injuring one another; their ways go on\r\ntogether without interfering one with another:\r\nthe smaller forces in river streams, the greater",
  "011.png": "forces in ample transformations. It is this that\r\nmakes the sky and earth so great.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe first environment of the human soul is\r\nthat of the family. Before we can become good\r\nsubjects, before we can aspire to study nature\r\nand mould ourselves upon the laws of heaven\r\nand earth, we must first of all learn to become\r\ngood sons, to complete the unity of family life.\r\nAll things will be added in their due course. To\r\nthe Chinese mind the successful policy in life is\r\na policy of adjustment. This policy runs from\r\nhighest to lowest, and back again from lowest\r\nto highest. The Emperor adjusts himself to the\r\nrequirements of his great Ministers, they in\r\ntheir turn to the provincial governors, they in\r\ntheir turn to the local magistrates, and so on\r\ndown the scale of social order. So this policy of\r\nadjustment works equally upwards from the\r\nyoungest son of the meanest family to the Emperor\r\nhimself, who adjusts his methods to those\r\nemployed by his August Father. As The Book\r\nof Odes says:\r\n\r\nThat great and noble Prince displayed\r\nThe sense of right in all he wrought;\r\nAdjusting justly, grade by grade,\r\nThe spirit of his wisdom swayed\r\nPeasant and peer; the crowd, the court.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that The Book of Filial\r\n\r\n1 Translated by John Carey Hall in Chinese Civilisation,\r\nby Pierre Laffitte.",
  "012.png": "Duty commences with a chapter on \"Filial Piety\r\nin the Son of Heaven.\" The Emperor is, the\r\nEmperor always has been, the father of the\r\ngreatest family on earth--the Chinese nation.\r\n\r\nII. The Twenty-four Examples of Filial Duty\r\n\r\nInstead of the Hsiao Hs\u00fceh, or Teaching for the\r\nYoung, which is usually grouped with The Book\r\nof Filial Duty, I have chosen The Twenty-four\r\nExamples of Filial Duty by way of illustration\r\nto the Hsiao Ching. They are na\u00efve and terse,\r\nand yet not without their simple charm. Even\r\nwhere they lend themselves to exaggeration, as\r\nin the story of the old gentleman who dressed\r\nhimself in gay garments and frisked in front of\r\nhis very venerable parents, they are not meaningless\r\nnor devoid of humanity. The lesson to\r\nbe drawn is that our duty towards our parents\r\nis the first obligation in life, and that we should\r\ngo, if necessary, to all lengths to fulfil it. Nothing\r\nis known of the authorship of these stories, or\r\nthe time in which they are written. Each story\r\nis accompanied by its commentary, and probably\r\nthe stories themselves originated during the Ming\r\ndynasty (A.D. 1368-1644), the commentaries belonging\r\nmostly to the latter years of that dynasty.\r\nThe period dealt with in these tales is a very\r\nwide one, and ranges from the time of the great\r\nEmperor Shun (circa 2300 B.C.) down to the Sung",
  "013.png": "dynasty (A.D. 900-1200). There have been many\r\neditions of The Twenty-four Examples in Chinese,\r\nmostly embellished with quaint and original\r\nwoodcuts, of which the figure on the cover of\r\nthe present volume, kindly supplied by Mrs.\r\nLionel Giles, is an example.\r\n\r\nIII. Filial Duty and Parental Love\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I hope none of my readers will\r\nimagine, from these examples and the treatise\r\nthat precedes them, that Chinese family life is\r\ncold and repellent, and devoid of mutual love.\r\nThe moment a tiny life enters the circle it is\r\nguarded by the triple walls of kinship. In the\r\nchildren our parents return to us; in the children\r\nwe survive. All through Chinese history the\r\nexile longs for return to wife and children. All\r\nthrough Chinese literature you will find allusion\r\nto the love of little ones which has been the\r\nheritage of the Chinese from time unknown.\r\nThe Book of Odes, quoted in Mr. Ku Hung-ming's\r\neloquent translation of the Chung Yung, or\r\nConduct of Life, for this Series, says:\r\n\r\nWhen wives and children and their sires are one,\r\n'Tis like the harp and lute in unison.\r\nWhen brothers live in concord and in peace,\r\nThe strains of harmony shall never cease.\r\nThe lamp of happy union lights the home,\r\nAnd bright days follow when the children come.",
  "014.png": "\r\nWith the Chinese the natural joys of life have\r\nalways been the most sought after. Home,\r\nfamily, friendship, landscape, and flowers--these\r\nare the pleasures which they delight in. The\r\nreligion of Confucius is the religion of daily life.\r\nOn the side of the parent there is responsibility;\r\non the side of the child, obedience, but not a\r\nblind one. Of the responsibility of parents there\r\nis no question. Confucius himself laid down the\r\nlaw when he sentenced a father, who had brought\r\nan accusation against his son, to be imprisoned\r\nwith him. On being remonstrated with, he made\r\nthis memorable reply: \"Am I to punish for a\r\nbreach of filial piety one who has never been\r\ntaught to be filially minded? Is not he who\r\nneglects to teach his son his duties equally guilty\r\nwith the son who fails in them? Crime is not\r\ninherent in human nature, and therefore the father\r\nin the family and the government in the State\r\nare responsible for the crimes committed against\r\nfilial piety and the public laws.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the obedient son must be\r\nable to discriminate and not follow blindly, when\r\nthe father is at fault. In the Li Chi, or Book of\r\nRites, it is written: \"When his parents are in\r\nerror, the son must remonstrate with them with\r\nrespect and gently. If they do not receive his reproof,\r\nhe must strive more and more to be dutiful\r\nand respectful towards them till they are pleased,\r\nand then he must again point out their fault.\"",
  "015.png": "\r\nThe Chinese give respect to the living, and also\r\nreverence the dead. It is from the past that\r\nthey have tried to learn, and the past is a pathway\r\nwhich the feet of spirits have trodden and made\r\nluminous. And, moreover, no man can escape\r\nfrom his ancestors, even if he go to the uttermost\r\nparts of the earth and dwell among strangers.\r\nOver the heads of the family the politician, ancient\r\nand modern, looks to the State. But China, from\r\nthe shelter and security of her myriad bulwarks,\r\nhas watched the sun of many empires rise and\r\nset.\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nIn preparing this little book for the press, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Lionel Giles and Mr. L. Cranmer-Byng\r\nfor their kind assistance. Mr. Giles has\r\nrevised the English spelling of Chinese names\r\naccording to the system almost universally\r\nadopted by sinologues to-day; while Mr. Cranmer-Byng\r\nhas made himself responsible for the Introduction.\r\nAs regards The Twenty-four Examples\r\nof Filial Duty, due acknowledgment must\r\nbe made to Vol. VI. of The Chinese Repository,\r\nwhich contains the only complete translation of\r\nthese stories, and has been extensively drawn\r\nupon for the present work.",
  "016.png": "\r\nTHE DOCTRINE OF FILIAL DUTY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF FILIAL DUTY\r\n\r\nONCE upon a time Confucius was sitting in\r\nhis study, having his disciple Ts\u00eang Ts'an to\r\nattend upon him. He asked Ts\u00eang Ts'an: \"Do\r\nyou know by what virtue and power the good Emperors\r\nof old made the world peaceful, the people\r\nto live in harmony with one another, and the\r\ninferior contented under the control of their\r\nsuperiors?\" To this Ts\u00eang Ts'an, rising from\r\nhis seat, replied: \"I do not know this, for I am\r\nnot clever.\" Then said Confucius: \"The duty\r\nof children to their parents is the fountain whence\r\nall other virtues spring, and also the starting-point\r\nfrom which we ought to begin our education.\r\nNow take your seat, and I will explain this. Our\r\nbody and hair and skin are all derived from our\r\nparents, and therefore we have no right to injure\r\nany of them in the least. This is the first duty\r\nof a child.",
  "017.png": "\r\n\"To live an upright life and to spread the\r\ngreat doctrines of humanity must win good\r\nreputation after death, and reflect great honour\r\nupon our parents. This is the last duty of a son.\r\n\r\n\"Hence the first duty of a son is to pay a\r\ncareful attention to every want of his parents.\r\nThe next is to serve his government loyally;\r\nand the last to establish a good name for himself.\r\n\r\n\"So it is written in the Ta Ya[1]: 'You must\r\nthink of your ancestors and continue to cultivate\r\nthe virtue which you inherit from them.'\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FILIAL DUTY OF AN EMPEROR\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the people from treating their\r\nparents with cruelty, the Emperor first sets an\r\nexample to them by showing a dear love to his\r\nmother; and in order to teach them not to treat\r\ntheir parents with rudeness, he first treats his\r\nparents with respect. Having loved and respected\r\nhis own parents, his good conduct will influence\r\nthe minds of his people, and his good example\r\nwill be followed by them.\r\n\r\nSo it is written in the Fu Hsing[2]: \"When\r\nthe Emperor has done a good act, millions\r\nwill be benefited.\"\r\n\r\n1 A section of the Canon of Poetry.\r\n\r\n2 The 27th of the books of Chou in the Canon of History.",
  "018.png": "\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FILIAL DUTY OF FEUDAL PRINCES\r\n\r\nAny man will be secure in his position, however\r\nhigh it may be, if he does not behave himself in\r\na haughty manner; and will be ever able to keep\r\nhis wealth if he is frugal and careful in his expenses.\r\n\r\nWhen he is able to secure himself in his high\r\nposition, he can, of course, remain unimpaired\r\nin his dignity; and where he can keep his wealth,\r\nhe will always remain rich. Having placed\r\nhimself in a position of honour, and secured the\r\npossession of his wealth, he will be able to protect\r\nhis country and further the welfare of his people.\r\nThis is the filial duty of a feudal Prince.\r\n\r\nIn the Shih Ching it is thus written: \"Be\r\ncareful as though you were standing upon the\r\nbrink of a high precipice or treading on thin ice.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FILIAL DUTY OF HIGH OFFICERS\r\n\r\nIf we do not put on such dress as our good\r\nEmperors of old would forbid, if we do not speak\r\nsuch words as they would forbid, and if we do\r\nnot behave ourselves in such a way as they\r\nwould forbid, then we shall be always right in\r\nwhat we say and what we do.

The\r\nlove toward them is the same. From the manner\r\nin which we should treat our father we also\r\nlearn how to serve our August Master. The\r\nrespect shown to them is the same. To our\r\nmother we show love, to our August Master\r\nrespect, while to our father, both love and respect.\r\nIf we can serve our August Master with such\r\nfeelings as we have toward our father, then\r\nloyalty is shown; and if we treat venerable\r\npersons with respect, then harmony will reign in\r\nthe circle of our life. Not failing to treat the\r\nAugust Master with loyalty and the venerable\r\nwith respect, we shall be able to make ourselves\r\nsecure in our high position and to offer sacrifices\r\nto our ancestors for ever.",

On this account our\r\neducation is wide-spread, though it is not compulsory,\r\nand our government is sound, though\r\nit is not rigorous. The effect of education upon\r\nthe minds of the people was well known to the\r\ngood Emperors of old. They made every person\r\nlove his parents by loving their own parents first.\r\nThey induced every person to cultivate his virtue\r\nby expounding the advantages of virtue to him.\r\nThey behaved themselves respectfully and humbly,\r\nso that the people might not quarrel with one\r\nanother. They trained the people with ceremonial\r\nobservances, and educated them with\r\nmusic so that they might live in harmony. They\r\ntold the people what things they liked or disliked\r\nto see done, so that they might understand what\r\nthey were forbidden to do.\r\n\r\nIn the Shih Ching it is thus written: \"The\r\ndignified statesman is always the subject of the\r\nattention of the people.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFILIAL DUTY IN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe good Emperors of old ruled the Empire by\r\nmeans of filial duty, and dared not neglect the\r\nministers of their vassal states. How much less",
  "022.png": "the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons!\r\nThey thereby gained the goodwill of all their vassal\r\nstates, which sent their deputies to represent\r\nthem in any sacrifice offered to the ancestors of\r\ntheir Supreme Master. This is what we mean\r\nby saying that the good Emperors of old governed\r\nthe world by filial duty.\r\n\r\nAs to the vassal states, their rulers dared not\r\ntreat widowers and widows with insolence; how\r\nthen could they dare act so towards the literary\r\nclass and the people? Hence they gained the\r\ngood-will of their subjects, and the latter would\r\njoin them in offering sacrifices to their ancestors.\r\n\r\nNow we may say a word about a family. If\r\nthe head of a family do not act haughtily towards\r\nhis servant, he cannot act so to his wife and\r\nchildren. Hence he will gain the goodwill of all\r\nhis people, and they will help him in the fulfilment\r\nof his filial duty. In such a family the parents\r\nmust feel happy when they are living, and their\r\nspirits must come to enjoy the sacrifice when\r\nthey are dead. By the principle of filial duty\r\nthe whole world can be made happy and all\r\ncalamities and dangers can be averted. Such\r\nwas the government of the Empire by the enlightened\r\nrulers of old, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of filial duty.\r\n\r\nIn the Shih Ching it is thus written: \"If you\r\nadorn yourself with the highest virtue, the whole\r\nworld will follow you.\"",
  "023.png": "\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT BY THE SAGE\r\n\r\nTs\u00eang Tz[)u] asked: \"Is filial piety the highest of\r\nall the virtues possessed by a great sage?\" To\r\nthis Confucius replied: \"There is nothing so great\r\nin the world as man, and there is nothing so great\r\nin a man as filial piety. The first duty of a son\r\nis to venerate his parent, and in order to show\r\nreverence for his dead father he has to offer him\r\nsacrifice when he offers sacrifices to Heaven. A\r\nman who had done this was the Duke of Chou.\r\nWhen he offered sacrifices to Heaven in a suburban\r\ndistrict, he also offered a sacrifice to his deceased\r\nancestor Hou Chi, and when he offered sacrifice\r\nto Heaven at the temple named Ming Tang, he\r\nalso made one to his deceased father W\u00ean Wang.\r\nHis good action produced such an effect that all\r\nthe feudal barons at that time came to assist him\r\nin performing the ceremony of offering sacrifice\r\nto Heaven. It is therefore evident that there is\r\nnothing so great in human nature as filial piety.\r\nThe feeling of affection is fostered during the\r\ntime of infancy, and from that affection springs\r\nreverence. Since every man has a natural\r\nreverence, the great sages of the time teach him\r\nhow and when to show it; and since he has a\r\nnatural feeling of affection, they teach him when\r\nand how to cultivate it. As the teachings of\r\nthese sages are based on the principle of filial",
  "024.png": "piety, their doctrine is propagated without effort,\r\nand their government is effectual without resorting\r\nto force. The affection between a father and a\r\nson is natural, and also a source from which\r\nsprings the reverence which a minister ought to\r\nshow to his sovereign. When parents have a son\r\nborn to them, the regular line of descent in the\r\nfamily is thereby secured. This is the greatest\r\nduty in family life. We must treat our parents\r\nwith the same reverence as is shown to our\r\nsovereign, because we receive boundless kindness\r\nfrom them and are under a natural obligation to\r\ndo so. If any one does not love his parents, but\r\nothers, he is a rebel against virtue; and if any one\r\ndoes not respect his parents, but others, he is also\r\na rebel against the standard of rites. Any action\r\nwhich is against the law of nature will certainly\r\nnot be an example for the public; and any one\r\nwho gets a high position, such as that of a ruler,\r\nby undue influence instead of by good actions,\r\nwill be despised by good men. As to the latter,\r\nthey say what they ought to say, and do what\r\nthey think is good for the public. Their virtue\r\nand justice are estimable, their actions are worthy\r\nof being followed, their behaviour is creditable,\r\nand their manner is correct in every way. If\r\nsuch persons are rulers of a state, they will afford\r\nto the people a good example to follow and will\r\nalso inspire them with reverence and affection.\r\nThis is principally the cause of their being suc-*",

(2) He must try to make\r\nthem happy in every possible way, especially\r\nwhen the meal is served. (3) He must take extra\r\ncare of them when they are sick.

Of them, disobedience to\r\none's parents is considered the most heinous\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nTo threaten the sovereign with force is an\r\nact which shows that the wrongdoer does not\r\nknow the duty of an inferior to a superior; to say\r\nanything against the government founded by\r\nthe wise men of many generations gone by is an\r\nact which shows that the speaker does not know\r\nwhat law is; and to say that a son need not be\r\nfilial to his parents is also an act which shows\r\nthat the speaker does not know what is the natural\r\nrelation and duty between a son and parents.\r\nSuch acts will no doubt lead the man to a wrong\r\ncourse of life.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAMPLIFICATION OF THE \"IMPORTANT DOCTRINE\"\r\n\r\nConfucius said: \"The best way to teach the\r\npeople to love their sovereign is for the sovereign",

It is simply due respect\r\nto one's elders. If I respect the parents, the son\r\nwill be pleased; if I respect the elder brothers,\r\nthe younger ones will be pleased; and if I respect\r\nthe sovereign, all the ministers will be pleased.\r\nI respect only one person, but I please thousands\r\nupon thousands. Those to whom the respect is\r\npaid are few, and those whom I please are many.\r\nThis is what is called an 'important doctrine.'\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nAMPLIFICATION OF \"THE HIGHEST VIRTUE\"\r\n\r\nConfucius said: \"When a ruler wishes to teach\r\nhis people to love their parents, he does not go\r\nto their family every day to teach them. He\r\nteaches them by his showing reverence to all old\r\npeople. In the same manner he teaches his\r\npeople to show respect to their elders by doing\r\nso first; and to be loyal to their ruler by his\r\ndoing duty to his superiors first.\r\n\r\n\"The Shih Ching says, 'The behaviour of the\r\nruler is so good that he is loved by the people as",

He always shows\r\nreverence to his elder brothers, and in order to\r\nfulfil his duty to them to the fullest extent, he\r\ndoes the same towards every one who is older\r\nthan he.\r\n\r\n\"As he can maintain order in his family affairs,\r\nso he can do the same in the government. He\r\nbases the principle of the government of a State\r\nupon that of a ruling family, and the consequent\r\nsuccess will make his name to be remembered\r\nthroughout generations to come.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF REMONSTRANCE IN CONNECTION\r\nWITH FILIAL DUTY\r\n\r\nTs\u00eang Tz[)u]; said: \"I have heard all that you\r\nsaid about parental love, filial love, reverence to\r\nelders, how to treat parents every day, and how",
  "029.png": "to please them by making oneself known for good\r\nconduct; and now I will venture to ask you\r\nwhether it is filial that a son should obey every\r\ncommand of his father, whether right or wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?--what do you say?\"\r\nreplied Confucius. \"Once upon a time there\r\nwas a certain Emperor who would have lost his\r\nempire through his wickedness, but that he had\r\nseven good ministers who often checked his illegal\r\nactions by strong protests; there was also a\r\nfeudal baron who would have lost his feudal\r\nestate through wantonness, but for the fact that\r\nhe had five good men who often made strong\r\nremonstrances to him; and there was also a\r\nstatesman who would have brought frightful\r\ncalamity upon his family, but for the fact that\r\nhe had three good servants who often strongly\r\nadvised him not to do what he ought not.\r\n\r\n\"If a man has a good friend to resist him in\r\ndoing bad actions, he will have his reputation\r\npreserved; so if a father has a son to resist his\r\nwrong commands, he will be saved from committing\r\nserious faults.\r\n\r\n\"When the command is wrong, a son should\r\nresist his father, and a minister should resist his\r\nAugust Master.\r\n\r\n\"The maxim is, 'Resist when wrongly commanded.'\r\nHence how can he be called filial\r\nwho obeys his father when he is commanded to\r\ndo wrong?\"",
  "030.png": "\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE AND FRUIT OF FILIAL PIETY\r\n\r\nThe good Emperors of old were not only filial to\r\ntheir parents, but also to the Supreme Father and\r\nMother--that is, Heaven and the Earth. When\r\nan Emperor can live in harmony with his elders,\r\nthere will be harmony throughout his dominion\r\nbetween superiors and inferiors; and when he is\r\nfilial to the Supreme Father and Mother, he will\r\nbe blessed by them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Emperor is the highest of all ranks,\r\nyet he still has some one to respect. He has his\r\nfather and elder brothers.\r\n\r\nWhy do we offer sacrifices to our ancestors in\r\nour family shrine? Because we ought not to\r\nforget them. Why must we cultivate our minds\r\nand be circumspect in our actions? Because we\r\ndo not wish to bring disgrace upon the name of\r\nour ancestors. If we can show respect to them\r\nwhen we offer them sacrifices in our family shrine,\r\nwe shall be blessed by the Supreme Father and\r\nMother. Filiality to parents and reverence to\r\nelders will be known to the Supreme Being, and\r\nwill be followed by the people in every part of\r\nthe world; no place can remain unaffected by\r\ntheir influence.

He will carry out any praiseworthy\r\nschemes projected by his master, and will correct\r\nany fault which he may commit. In this way\r\na great affection will be fostered between them.\r\n\r\n\"Thus in the Shih Ching it is written: 'Although\r\nthe minister may be far away from his\r\nmaster, yet his affection will not be affected by\r\nthe distance. He is so attached to him that he\r\nthinks of him every day.'\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMOURNING FOR ONE'S PARENTS\r\n\r\nConfucius said: \"When a filial son loses his\r\nparent, he, of course, cannot help crying piteously.\r\nHe cannot feel happy when he hears music. He\r\nwill have no appetite for food, however tempting\r\na savoury. He will greet no visitor, have no\r\nregard for elegance of speech, and will put on a\r\nmourning-dress instead of a beautiful one. All\r\nthese tell us the extent of his sorrow for his lost",

This is the doctrine laid down\r\nby good men of old. That mourning only extends\r\nto the period of three years shows that\r\nthere is a limit for our sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"For the corpse we make a coffin and some\r\nclothes. We set forth the sacrificial vessels, and\r\nat the sight of them grief breaks forth afresh.\r\nThe women beat their breasts, the men stamp\r\ntheir feet, and with weeping and wailing escort\r\nthe coffin to its resting-place.

His actions are related\r\nin the Shang Shu, in the Chung Yung, and in the\r\nworks of Mencius. Those who speak of him say\r\nthat Shun cultivated the hills of Li (in the province\r\nof Shansi), where he had elephants to plough his\r\nfields and birds to weed the grain. So widespread\r\nwas the renown of his virtue that the\r\nEmperor Yao heard of him, and sent his nine\r\nsons to serve him, and gave to him two of his\r\ndaughters in marriage, and afterwards resigned\r\nto him the imperial dignity.\r\n\r\nOf all those whose virtue and filial duty deserve\r\nto be illustrated, Shun is pre-eminent;\r\nand his example, in obeying his parents, is worthy\r\nof being handed down to posterity, through\r\nmyriads of ages.

He laboriously\r\nperformed all these duties, but his parents were\r\nnot affected, while his brother Hsiang became\r\nmore insolent and overbearing. His parents\r\nalleged crimes against him, but Shun could not\r\nfind that he had done wrong; he loved and\r\nrevered them, though they did not requite him\r\nwith affection. His feelings were grieved at\r\nthese manifold troubles, and with strong crying\r\nand tears he invoked Heaven.\r\n\r\nHis perfect sincerity was effectual to renovate\r\nhis family; his parents became pleasant, and his\r\nbrother more conciliatory and virtuous. Heaven\r\nalso considered his excellency to be great, and\r\nregarded him as truly good, thus establishing\r\nhis reputation so firmly that it was perpetuated\r\nto, and influenced, succeeding ages. Even Confucius\r\nis regarded as elevated but a little above\r\nShun, and I would praise and extol them both\r\nto coming generations.\r\n\r\nNo. II\r\n\r\nAffection shown in tasting Soups and Medicines\r\n\r\nThe Emperor W\u00ean of the Han dynasty, the\r\nthird son of his father, Kao Tsu, was appointed",

She was ill for three\r\nyears, during which time his eyelids did not close,\r\nnor was the girdle of his dress unloosed; and\r\nshe took none of the soups and medicines prepared\r\nfor her till he had tasted them. This\r\nbenevolence and filial affection was heard of\r\nthroughout the empire.\r\n\r\nW\u00ean received direction to go and arrange the\r\nimperial sacrifices, and requested his mother to\r\naccompany him to the royal domains. Morning\r\nand evening he visited her in her own apartments,\r\nand handed her the fragrant dishes. If the\r\nprovisions had lost their flavour, he was vexed;\r\nand when tasting the medicines he commanded\r\nperfect silence. The live-long night his girdle was\r\nnot loosed, nor for three years were his eyelids\r\nclosed. By as much as his animal spirits were exhausted,\r\nby so much the more did his heart become\r\nfixed on the subject of its affection; and for a long\r\ntime his thoughts were not distracted. Such\r\nfilial love and virtue so moved upon Heaven's\r\nkind regard, that it wrought upon his father to\r\nconfer the throne upon him as his patrimony.\r\n\r\nNo. III\r\n\r\nGnawing her Finger pained his Heart\r\n\r\nDuring the Chou dynasty there lived a lad named\r\nTs\u00eang Ts'an, a disciple of Confucius, who served",

She, while expecting\r\nher son, who delayed his return, began\r\nto gnaw her fingers. Ts\u00eang suddenly felt a pain\r\nin his heart, and took up his bundle of faggots\r\nin order to return home; and when he saw his\r\nmother, he kneeled and begged to know what\r\nwas the cause of her anxiety.

  "046.png": "She was also fond of carp, and when it was\r\nobtained, deeming herself unable to consume\r\nalone what her children with great toil and trouble\r\ncontinually prepared for her, usually invited some\r\nof the neighbours to feast with her. By the side\r\nof the cottage there suddenly gushed a fountain,\r\nthe taste of whose waters was like that of the\r\nriver, and it also produced two living fishes daily.\r\nThese were taken out and prepared by Chiang\r\nShih for his mother.\r\n\r\nThe fish from the river were fresh and delicious,\r\nand the water was sweet; the mother of Chiang\r\nShih wished to taste of both daily. Her son went\r\nto purchase the fish and her daughter-in-law to\r\nbring the water; as constantly as the revolution\r\nof morning and evening did they exert themselves\r\nin this arduous labour. Having obtained the fish\r\nand water, her countenance brightened, and,\r\nlaughing, she invited in one of the neighbours to\r\nrejoice and partake of them with her. Sitting\r\nopposite at the table, together they ate them, she\r\nfoolishly not even regarding, but totally forgetting,\r\nher son and daughter, who with so much\r\ntrouble had prepared them for her. Heaven\r\ntook pity on these two filial children, and employed\r\nits divine power to assist them, sending a\r\nspirit to strike the earth with an axe which\r\ncaused a perennial spring to bubble forth. The\r\ntaste of the water from the fountain was like that\r\nfrom the river, and two fish continually sported",

To procure the fish now\r\nno money was needed, to obtain the water no\r\nlong and weary walk was to be taken. It was as\r\nif the productions of this river and of the water\r\nwere transferred into the midst of the cottage;\r\nand Chiang Shih could support his family with\r\nease for many years.\r\n\r\nNo. XII\r\n\r\nHe carved Wood and served his Parents\r\n\r\nDuring the Han dynasty lived Ting Lan, whose\r\nparents both died when he was young, before he\r\ncould obey and support them; and he reflected\r\nthat for all the trouble and anxiety he had caused\r\nthem, no recompense had yet been given. He\r\nthen carved wooden images of his parents, and\r\nserved them as if they had been alive. For a\r\nlong time his wife would not reverence them;\r\nand one day, taking a bodkin, she pricked their\r\nfingers in derision. Blood flowed immediately\r\nfrom the wound; and seeing Ting coming, the\r\nimages wept. He inquired into the circumstances,\r\nand forthwith divorced his wife.\r\n\r\nHe remembers his parents, but cannot see\r\nthem; so he carves wood to represent their\r\npersons. He believes that their spirits are now\r\nthe same as when they were alive, and his quietless",
  "048.png": "heart trusts that their spirits have entered the\r\ncarved images. He cannot rest until he has made\r\ntheir statues, so strong is his desire to nourish and\r\nreverence them. He now reveres them, although\r\ndead, as if they were alive; and hopes they will\r\ncondescend to dwell in his ancestral hall.\r\n\r\nNo. XIII\r\n\r\nFor his Mother's Sake he would bury his Child\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Han dynasty lived Kuo Ch\u00fc,\r\nwho was very poor. He had one child three\r\nyears old; and such was his poverty that his\r\nmother usually divided her portion of food with\r\nthis little one. Kuo says to his wife: \"We are so\r\npoor that our mother cannot be supported, for\r\nthe child divides with her the portion of food that\r\nbelongs to her. Why not bury this child?\r\nAnother child may be born to us, but a mother,\r\nonce gone, will never return.\" His wife did not\r\nventure to object to the proposal, and Kuo\r\nimmediately digs a hole about three cubits deep,\r\nwhen suddenly he lights upon a pot of gold, and\r\non the metal reads the following inscription:\r\n\"Heaven bestows this treasure upon Kuo Ch\u00fc,\r\nthe dutiful son; the magistrate may not seize\r\nit, nor shall the neighbours take it from him.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a foolish action, that the sage Kuo should\r\nbe willing to bury his own child! Fearing lest\r\nhis mother should not have enough to eat, he is",
  "049.png": "willing to resign his child to death; but when it\r\nis dead, what relief will there be for the grief of its\r\naffectionate grandmother? When a number of\r\ncares come at some future time, who then will be\r\nable to disperse them if the child is dead? But\r\nat this time the reflection that his mother would\r\nbe in want filled his breast with grief, and he had\r\nno time to think of the future when he would be\r\nchildless. Heaven having given him a dutiful\r\nmind, caused him to take a light hoe for digging\r\nthe earth. Together Kuo and his wife went,\r\nsorrowing and distressed, by the way, until they\r\ncame to a very hilly place, where they stopped.\r\nHaving dug into the ground, suddenly a gleam\r\nof light shot forth, and the pot of yellow gold\r\nwhich Heaven had deposited there was seen.\r\nTaking it up, they clasped their child with ecstasy\r\nin their arms and returned home; for now they\r\nhad sufficient to support their whole family in\r\nplenty.\r\n\r\nNo. XIV\r\n\r\nHe seized the Tiger and saved his Father\r\n\r\nIn the Han dynasty lived Yang Hsiang, a lad\r\nof fourteen, who was in the habit of following his\r\nfather to the fields to cut grain. Once a tiger\r\nseized his father, and was slowly carrying him off,\r\nwhen Yang, anxious for his father and forgetting",
  "050.png": "himself, although he had no iron weapon in his\r\nhand, rushed forward and seized the tiger by the\r\nneck. The beast let the prey fall from his teeth,\r\nand fled, and Yang's father was thus saved from\r\ninjury and death.\r\n\r\nA tiger suddenly appears in the borders of the\r\nfield, and seizes the man as lightly as he catches\r\na sheep, and drags him off. Yang Hsiang, seeing\r\nthe sudden peril of his father, was vexed that he\r\nhad no weapon with an iron head; but being\r\nstrongly excited and his feelings roused, he ran\r\nforward in the path, crying with a loud voice,\r\nand grasped the tiger by the neck. The frightened\r\nanimal fled, nor stopped in its rapid course until\r\nit reached the high hills. Yang then, in a gentle\r\nmanner, raised his father up and led him home,\r\nendeavouring to soothe his mind and dispel his\r\nfears, and also presented him the golden wine-*cup.\r\nAmong the great number of sages whose\r\nreputations are famous, how few of them have\r\nbeen devoted and filial at the hazard of their\r\nlives! But this lad, quite young and fair, as soon\r\nas he saw his father's danger, risked his own life;\r\nsurely his fame will spread throughout the\r\ncountry. We have heard of the lady T'i Ying,\r\nwho saved her father from banishment, and of\r\nyoung Chu O, who lost her life in trying to rescue\r\nher father from drowning; and I think that Yang\r\nHsiang will form a trio with them, and the three\r\nbe celebrated in the same ode.",

It happened\r\nthat, during the troubles of the time, when Wang\r\nMang was plotting to usurp the throne, there were\r\nyears of scarcity, in which he could not procure\r\nfood, and Ts'ai was compelled to gather mulberries,\r\nwhich he assorted, putting them into two\r\nvessels. The red-eyebrowed robber[*] saw him,\r\nand inquired why he did thus. Ts'ai replied:\r\n\"The black and ripe berries I give to my mother,\r\nthe yellow and unripe ones I eat myself.\" The\r\nbandit admired his filial affection, and rewarded\r\nhim with three measures of white rice and the\r\nleg of an ox.\r\n\r\nAnxious and fearful, he seeks for food; untiring\r\nin his toil, he takes up his baskets and penetrates\r\nthe thickets of the distant forests, where he\r\nfinds many mulberry-trees. His hunger now\r\nhas something to satisfy its cravings; he also\r\nremembers his mother, and that he must carry\r\nsome to her. The ripe and unripe berries he\r\ndoes not put together, but divides them, so that\r\nmother and son can each have their proper\r\nportion.

Two of them the lad put in his\r\nbosom, and when turning to thank the giver, they\r\nfell out on the ground. When the general saw\r\nthis, he said: \"Why does my young friend, who\r\nis now a guest, put the fruit away in his bosom?\"\r\nThe youth, bowing, replied: \"My mother is very\r\nfond of oranges, and I wished, when I returned\r\nhome, to present them to her.\" At this answer\r\nY\u00fcan was much astonished.\r\n\r\nOn account of his love for his parent, he would\r\nnot at first taste the present of fruit, but put into\r\nhis sleeve to carry home the fragrant and luscious\r\ngift. I think that when he saw his mother, her\r\npleasant countenance must have brightened, for\r\nthe fruit filled his bosom and delighted all who\r\ncame near him.

After her death her grave\r\nwas dug in the hilly forest; and whenever it blew\r\nand rained furiously, and Wang heard the sound\r\nof the chariot of the Thunder-goddess rolling\r\nalong, he hastened immediately to the grave, and,\r\nreverently kneeling, besought her with tears,\r\nsaying: \"I am here, dear mother; do not be\r\nalarmed.\" And afterwards, whenever he read\r\nin The Book of Odes this sentence, \"Children\r\nshould have deep and ardent affection for their\r\nparents, who have endured so much anxiety in\r\nnourishing them,\" the tears flowed abundantly at\r\nthe recollection of his mother.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the black clouds arise from the\r\nwilderness, whirled by the wind; he hears the\r\ndistant mutter of thunder from the southern hills.\r\nHeedless of the rain, hastily he speeds over the\r\nrugged path leading to the tomb, and as he goes\r\nround the grave his tones of grief and entreaty\r\nare heard. The roaring of the dreadful thunder\r\naffrights the ears of men, one clap following\r\nanother in quick succession. If his kind mother,",

If P'ou\r\nwas with his mother, he knew she would be comforted;\r\nand he thinks that if in the green hills she\r\nhas a companion, she will not be terrified. Afterwards,\r\nbeing successful, he refused to take the\r\nduties of an officer under the Emperor Ss[)u]-ma,\r\nbecause he wished to go frequently to visit the\r\ngrave of his parent. And when he was going and\r\nreturning from it, he would weep at the recollection\r\nof his mother, and ask himself: \"If I have\r\nnot yet recompensed the care and trouble my\r\nmother endured for me, what more can I do?\"\r\nAnd to this day, whenever scholars read the pages\r\nof the Liu O, they remember how tears bedewed\r\nthe cheeks of Wang P'ou.\r\n\r\nNo. XVIII\r\n\r\nHe wept to the Bamboos, and Shoots sprang up\r\n\r\nM\u00eang Tsung, who lived in the Chin dynasty,\r\nlost his father when young.

At last he went into the bamboo\r\ngrove, and, clasping the bamboos with his hands,\r\nwept bitterly. His filial love moved Nature, and\r\nthe ground slowly opened, sending forth several\r\nshoots, which he gathered and carried home. He",
  "055.png": "made a soup of them, which his mother tasted,\r\nand immediately recovered from her malady.\r\n\r\nIn winter, when the forests are unsightly and\r\nbare, and the bamboos sombre and gloomy, for\r\nplants to send forth their branches is surprising\r\nand unexpected. But it is impossible to root out\r\nthe true filial nature from men who have it,\r\nalthough senseless and ignorant people, not understanding\r\nits power, ridicule them, calling them\r\nmad. The young M\u00eang Tsung dutifully served\r\nhis mother, and morning and evening waited on\r\nher to receive her commands. His mother was\r\nill, and desired the delicacy of a soup made from\r\nbamboo shoots; but in dreary winter, Nature\r\nstill concealed her fruits awaited. With anxious\r\nhaste he goes to the cheerless forest, which he\r\nenters, seeking for them; but not finding the\r\nshoots, he entreats the bamboos with tears. One\r\npetition from his inmost heart ascended to the\r\nthreshold of heaven, and the deities were delighted,\r\nlaughing with pleasure.
