  "p0010.png": "\r\nCHILE AND THE NITRATE FIELDS, &c.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nWHY AND HOW I WENT THERE.\r\n\r\nOn 13th February, 1889, my wife and I embarked at\r\nLisbon on board the Royal Pacific Steam Navigation\r\nCompany's steamer Galicia, Captain Adey, for Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nBut a few days previously, intending to spend a couple\r\nof months in Egypt, I ordered an outfit at Silver's,\r\nengaged apartments at Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, and\r\nretained places to Ismailia in the Peninsular and Oriental\r\nMirzapore for 7th February. We were leaving England\r\nthat we might escape the remaining severities of a winter\r\nwhich had tried us both, and that I might visit friends\r\nI much valued, in a land which has always had for\r\nme great attractions. An accidental meeting and a few\r\nminutes' conversation with Colonel North at a luncheon\r\nparty on 28th January, changed our destination from Cairo\r\nto Chile.\r\n\r\nCrippled by the results of a crush under my horse in my\r\nlast campaign, in the Transvaal, unable to ride, obliged to\r\nwalk with a stick, I have in my old age a lingering love\r\nof travel, a desire like that which animated Lord Lovel\r\n\"strange countries for to see.\" I had never been farther\r\nsouth on the western coast of the American continent than",
  "p0020.png": "Panama. The Straits of Magellan exercised a strange influence\r\nover my imagination, or what was left of it. And\r\nso my compass began to turn from east to west, and the\r\ndirection which at first I regarded as impossible, presently\r\nbecame obviously easy and desirable.\r\n\r\nI was invited to go out that I might see and report what\r\nhad been done and what was being done, and to examine\r\nthe works which had transformed the desert of Tarapac\u00e1--wastes\r\nwithout a sign of life or vegetation--into a centre\r\nof commercial enterprise, and which had covered it with animated\r\nindustry and prosperous life. It had been asserted in\r\ncertain journals that commercial enterprises in that region\r\nwere shams--\"swindles,\" indeed, would be the word to use\r\nif they were what those organs described them to be--and\r\nthat a railway, in which the public had invested largely,\r\nwas \"a tramway ending in a marsh.\" Although I cannot\r\nsay I was a very Gallio in respect to these things, I\r\ncertainly knew nothing of them. I told my friends that\r\nI was perfectly and altogether ignorant \"in that connection.\"\r\n\"So much the better!\" All I would have to\r\ndo was to judge for myself and relate what I saw. There\r\nwas no mystery to penetrate, no theory to demolish or sustain,\r\nno complex problems to study.\r\n\r\nThere was only one objection--the voyage--there was\r\nthe rub! By the exercise of dialectic skill, when we were\r\nsettling the details of our Egyptian expedition, I had overcome\r\nmy wife's preference for Venice or Brindisi, as points\r\nof departure, to Tilbury. I had persuaded her that where\r\ntime was of no consequence, it was much better to take ship\r\nin the Thames and to proceed direct to the Suez Canal,\r\nimproving her mind by the inspection of Gibraltar and\r\nNaples, or Malta, rejoicing on the way in the genial airs\r\nand bounding over the azure waters of the Mediterranean,",
  "p0030.png": "than to endure the long and tedious railway journey to\r\nan Italian port. (I must admit the Mirzapore had by no\r\nmeans a cheerful experience of the Bay of Biscay, and\r\nhad we been on board I should perhaps have been\r\nexposed to some just reproaches on the ground of misrepresentation.)\r\nBut when I told my wife, in speaking\r\nof the proposal so suddenly laid before me, that the main\r\nimpediment I saw to the acceptance of it was the fear of her\r\nsuffering from the attacks of an enemy, much dreaded and\r\nhitherto always invincible, she at once declared that she\r\nwas ready to encounter the miseries of the mal de mer, in\r\nthe hope that she would not suffer more than the young\r\nladies who were to be her companions. I had my doubts,\r\nfor I knew what she endured when crossing over to Ireland\r\nor France.\r\n\r\nBut I hit upon an expedient which satisfied my conscience,\r\nand which had a comforting effect on both of us. It\r\nwas not possible to join the party which was to sail from\r\nLiverpool on 6th of February. I had to make arrangements\r\nfor an absence of six months instead of one of as many\r\nweeks--to provide for contingencies which might arise when\r\nI was thousands of miles away. I could come back from\r\nEgypt in six or seven days. I could not reach London\r\nfrom Santiago in less than six or seven weeks.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged, therefore, that I should complete my\r\npreparations and take the \"train de luxe\" from Victoria to\r\nLisbon, where we were to embark on board the Galicia,\r\nwhich was to arrive in the Tagus on the 13th. Thus the\r\ndreaded Bay of Biscay and the tumultuous rollers off the\r\nSpanish coast would be evaded. If--judging from our five\r\nor six days' experience of it between the Tagus and St.\r\nVincent--there was no prospect of my wife becoming\r\naccustomed to the sea, I resolved to abandon the pro-*",
  "p0040.png": "*secution of our voyage, to land on the island and take the\r\nfirst ship back to England. It so chanced that had it been\r\nexpedient to act on that idea we should have had the\r\nquarantine to face and to suffer at St. Vincent. But it was\r\nnot necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four days of malaise in her berth, my wife,\r\nfortified by \"Pope Roach's Specific,\" defeated the enemy,\r\ngot what sailors call her \"sea-legs,\" and appeared upon\r\ndeck triumphant. Although she sought retirement and disappeared\r\nwhen \"the fiddles\" were on the table, she eventually\r\nbecame a very fair, if fair-weather, sailor, quite ready for a\r\nvoyage round the world. There was indeed seldom occasion\r\nfor the application of these same fiddles--the stormy\r\npetrels of the festive board at sea--at our banquets.",

M.\r\nPower, C.E., Mr. Melton Prior, the artist of the Illustrated\r\nLondon News, and Captain Brough, a mariner of long experience\r\nin the merchant service in the Pacific and Atlantic\r\nseas, coasts and in all parts of the world, and our two\r\nselves. Mr. and Miss Gilling, who came on board the\r\nGalicia at Lisbon, were added to the members of the expedition,\r\nwhich was further augmented by Mr. Cook and Mr.\r\nBlain, two young gentlemen who were travelling for pleasure\r\nand improvement to the American continent. Mr. E. Spencer,\r\nM.P., and Mrs. Spencer, who made Colonel North's acquaintance\r\nat Liverpool, and who were going to Valparaiso\r\nand New York, in the same vessel, accompanied the party.\r\nSo we were a goodly company of fifteen, to which, later\r\non, was added \"a private secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Galicia, an easy, comfortable old ship, built by the\r\nNapiers, with engines by the same firm working as well as",
  "p0060.png": "the day they were born--eleven years back--had little\r\nadverse sea or winds to test her seagoing qualities, and ran\r\nwestward day after day, with an average run of over 300\r\nmiles, from the time we left the Tagus till we sighted the\r\nhighlands of Brazil on Tuesday, 26th of February.\r\n\r\nResources which lie dormant on shore are developed\r\non board ship; many remember the experiences of long\r\nvoyages and revive them for the benefit of their fellow passengers.\r\nThe ample flush-deck of the Galicia was a capital\r\nplayground for the usual sports of the younger passengers,\r\nand if such things as Ethiopian minstrelsy, poker, marine\r\nroulette, &c., were interpolated, it was rather as ornamental\r\nand occasional diversions than as settled pursuits. We\r\nhad many foreigners and several hundred emigrants on\r\nboard, and they were amused and astonished at the energy\r\nwith which, as soon as the lotteries on the day's run and\r\nthe pool auction were over, the English men and women,\r\nled by the Colonel, applied themselves to races, deck-tennis,\r\ncricket, running and jumping, and other amusements,\r\nwhich, culminating in dance and song in the even-*tide[** P3: one word],\r\nlasted till it was time to put the lights out.\r\n\r\nThere were not many external attractions. There were\r\nof course flying-fish and porpoises which never come amiss,\r\nand there was one little excitement as we approached St.\r\nVincent. A suspicious case of illness between decks was\r\nreported, and if the Galicia had come to anchor and if the\r\nhealth officers had come down upon that \"case,\" we should\r\nnot have been allowed to start with a clean bill of health\r\nfor Rio, and our one passenger, an English employ\u00e9 at the\r\ntelegraph station, who was to land at St. Vincent, would\r\nhave been clapped into quarantine. So Captain Adey kept\r\nthe screw gently moving and the Galicia slowly turning, in\r\nthe harbour of St. Vincent under very easy steam, with all",
  "p0070.png": "kinds of officials holding on to us alongside, until at last our\r\npassenger was got rid of and restored to his wife and family,\r\nand we continued on our way over sunny seas.\r\n\r\nEach day passed exceedingly like the other. Sometimes\r\nthere was \"una calma furiosa,\" and presently we were \"in\r\n\r\nNative Divers. St. Vincent.\r\n\r\nthe doldrums.\" Then, after a while, came puffs of muggy\r\nwind, and we were in the tropics; anon we had crossed\r\nthe line, and \"no one ever felt it\"--and the Pole-star\r\ndropped astern. Every day there were lotteries, auctions,\r\ngames, and capers. Signor Bottoni blew his cornet, and\r\nother performers produced guitars and banjos to vary our\r\nentertainments. But it was an effort, and a sea change",
  "p0080.png": "was needed. After a week or so even the sea-gulls got\r\ntired of us and at last dropped behind the ship; and there\r\nwas no outside sensation worth mentioning till, on the 26th\r\nof February, we were off Cape Frio.\r\n\r\n\"It was there,\" said one of the passengers, pointing\r\nto a rocky bay, \"that Her Majesty's ship Thetis tried\r\nto batter the Cape down but went down herself with\r\nall her treasure on board.\" While we were looking at\r\nthe fine bold coast rapidly rising to view on our star-*board\r\nbow, as the ship was screwing her course through a\r\nmirror-like sea, there appeared above the surface, within\r\neasy shot, the back-fin of an enormous shark, which gave\r\nat once an impetus to the owner of every rifle in the ship.\r\nAttracted probably by fish upon which island-like clouds of\r\n\"molly-hawks,\" boobies and noddies, blackening the ocean,\r\nwere feasting near at hand, shark-fins enough to satiate a\r\ncolony of Chinamen rose above the glassy surface of the\r\neasy-rolling sea, and became speedily the objects of indiscriminate\r\npractice, and when Captain Adey made a very\r\npalpable hit, and the owner of a floating bull's-eye churned\r\nthe water in an angry circle, there was widespread and\r\nloudly-expressed satisfaction at the feat. But the sea did\r\nnot give up its dead. The shark did not float as we\r\nexpected and hoped it would, and presently, as if the news\r\nof danger had been made known down below, the sharks'\r\nfins disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the custom which prevails in the\r\nships of the great English companies at sea, there was\r\ndivine service on board the Galicia every Sunday. The\r\nforeigners regarded the religious ceremony in the saloon\r\nthrough the gratings, or when service was on deck, looked\r\non with something like amusement in their faces. One\r\nof my fellow-passengers observed that \"he did not think",

  "p0090.png": "Englishmen were a bit better for all their Sunday praying\r\nand singing! They came out to make money, and they\r\ndrank and swore, gambled and quarrelled, and cheated\r\njust like other people!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th February the Galicia, saluting the Imperial\r\nStandard as she passed the fortress of Santa Cruz, anchored\r\nin the harbour of Rio de Janeiro. The day was intensely\r\nhot. The glorious landscape of this most beautiful bay was\r\nseen through a quivering wall of air waves which, if it imparted\r\na grace to the town which close inspection completely\r\ndissipated, concealed the details of the scenery.\r\nThere were, however, plainly visible the well-named Organ\r\nMountains (Org\u00e3os[** \u00d3rg\u00e3os ?]) with pipes and barrels towering aloft\r\nas the background to the sharp outlines of the lower ranges,\r\nthe peaks of La Gabia, and of the Sugar Loaf, and the\r\ngigantic outline of a face variously called Lord Hood's,\r\nBonaparte's, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Health Officers came off at their leisure an hour\r\nor so after we anchored, but they made a close investigation\r\ninto our sanitary condition, \"jalousing,\" as a\r\ngillie would say, the arrival of a fresh supply of Yellow\r\nFever, of which there was already more than enough\r\non shore. \"What on earth,\" exclaimed one of our British\r\nbrethren, \"are those absurd coffee-coloured chaps doing\r\nnow?

Notwithstanding\r\nthe enlightened opinion of experts, the confirmed\r\nprejudices of mariners and the incredulity of English\r\nauthorities regarding the value of seclusion, I must\r\nexpress my own strong conviction that it is almost possible\r\nto entirely shut out cholera and Yellow Jack by quarantine\r\nregulation. If there be any truth in the doctrine of the\r\npropagation of disease by microbes and bacilli, it surely\r\nstands to reason that, although those germs cannot be quite\r\nexcluded from the air, the diffusion of them from personal\r\ncentres can be nearly stopped if all the latter be shut up\r\nin isolated places.\r\n\r\nThe news brought by the consular officers and the\r\nCompany's agents when they were allowed on board was\r\nnot cheering. \"Twenty funerals a day,\" some said--\"Twice\r\nas many,\" according to others-mostly of victims to vomito.\r\nBut that was nothing to speak of compared with the usual\r\nmortality of a bad epidemy at Rio. The ravages of Yellow\r\nJack in the city were unusually widespread, and we were\r\nby no means encouraged to spend a night in one of the\r\nhotels in the town. But the coaling of the ship, inevitable\r\nand imminent, ports closed, doors shut, heat, dust, and\r\nsmother, were evils to be shunned, even at considerable\r\nrisk, so it was with much content we heard that we could\r\nmake an expedition to the hill of Tijuca--I am not certain",

The\r\nbright colouring of the buildings gave to Rio a bright\r\nand cheerful aspect from outside, but it was \"distance\"\r\nthat \"lent enchantment to the view.\" The crowd that\r\nlooked so picturesque through the glass was resolved\r\ninto unseemly elements, men and women of every shade\r\nand colour from the deepest black (a great many of them)\r\nto the milkiest, sickliest white, in garments of many\r\ncolours, their heads covered with eccentric structures of\r\nstraw and coloured stuff, many ragged, some, if, indeed,\r\nit were not excessive jollity and merriment which made\r\nthem caper and shout as they reeled along holding each\r\nother's hands, not quite sober. Close to the landing place\r\nthere was a market, and the quay near it was ankle deep\r\nin abominable vegetable refuse, rotten cocoanuts, pumpkins,\r\ngourds, oranges, covered with swarms of flies. The smells\r\nwere very offensive. I could not help thinking that the\r\nsanitary officers might begin their labours on shore before\r\nthey went off to sea to visit the shipping.\r\n\r\nWhilst our baggage was being landed, we strolled\r\nabout the streets.

We\r\nheard many things in relation to cleanliness and morality\r\nin Rio which, if true, leave much to be done by the\r\nsanitary science man and the Christian missionary. But\r\nreflecting on the likelihood that a foreigner would, if he\r\nwere not an emancipated negro, see many things to shock\r\nhim in the east end of cities nearer home, I thought it\r\nwould be well, perhaps, not to be too severe on Rio, where\r\nthe book-shop windows were placarded with terrible prints\r\nillustrative of the life and times of \"Jack the Ripper,\"\r\nsent, probably, from Lisbon, where coloured representations\r\nof the deeds of that monster were to be seen on\r\nevery wall.

The\r\npeople would not be less wretched were there no tramcars\r\nor railways.

Nor could we start till order was\r\nevoked from chaos in the telephone room, where there was\r\na confused jangling of Portuguese, English, and French,\r\nbetween the operators in the hotel aloft and our amateur\r\ninterpreters in the coach office, who were bent on ascertaining\r\nwhat accommodation and what provision for their\r\ncreature comforts they had to expect when they reached\r\ntheir goal.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark when the journey began, but the\r\nnight concealed the dangers we were tempting on our way,\r\nand it also enabled us to enjoy the brilliant spectacle of the\r\nlights in the city and in the ships clustered in the bay.\r\nIt was as though we were looking down on constellations\r\nfrom some prodigious height to which we had soared in an\r\nimpossible balloon. Though the road was excellent and\r\nwas admirably engineered up the sides of the hill, the\r\ncurves were sharp and the boundary at the edge of the precipice\r\nlow and slim, and, as the mules were whipped full\r\ntilt round the corners, the char-\u00e0-banc swaying under the\r\ntop weight came at times within a scarcely measurable\r\ndistance of the margin.

The\r\nheight and beauty of the palms and of the other trees around\r\nus, especially of the ipa, were phenomenal, the blaze of\r\ncolour of the flowers and buds dazzling--an infinite variety\r\nof vegetation, climbing plants, creepers, tree ferns, in\r\nriotous excess, revelling in strength in a land where man,\r\nsunned down so much that he loses fibre and energy, is\r\noften dwarfed. Brilliantly-coloured butterflies, \"as large\r\nas thrushes,\" some of my friends said, \"bigger than crows,\"\r\nsaid others, fluttered along the alleys in the garden. Humming-birds\r\nhung like brighter flowers from the petals of\r\nthe plants, where they were seeking their insect food, or\r\nflashed like jewels from shrub to shrub along the borders\r\nof the paths.

We left\r\nWhyte's Hotel with regret. The road downwards to the\r\nsea level is bordered by villas--many of considerable size--in\r\ndetached gardens full of orange-trees, palms, bamboo\r\nclumps and plantains, with elaborately-worked, gaily-painted\r\nor richly gilt, iron gateways.\r\n\r\nWe were whirled at a breakneck pace down towards the\r\ntown and were fully able to appreciate in the garish light\r\nof day the dangers we had escaped in our ascent at night.\r\n\r\nIt was only after we had got on board we ascertained why\r\nso many of the villas we had been admiring on our way\r\nwere closed, and with blinds down.

Visitors who had to make necessary\r\npurchases of clothing were loud in lamentation over the\r\nprices. In these I shared, for my wife had to pay \u00a312 for a\r\ncommon cotton morning gown.\r\n\r\nIt was only by the exercise of patience, the services of a\r\nfriend in the Consulate, and the use of many words in three\r\nlanguages, I came to obtain change for a circular note at\r\nthe Bank. The bankers admitted that they were the\r\ncorrespondents of Coutts, Messrs. Coutts were good for the\r\nmoney, but they wanted some proof that I was the man who\r\nhad signed \"W. H.

Our gold clerk has\r\ngone out with the key and won't be back till 4 o'clock.\"\r\nThe Galicia was off at 6 o'clock, probably before the \"gold\r\nclerk\" returned.\r\n\r\nAt noon next day (March 1st) we were two hundred\r\nand thirty-four miles from Rio, and were gradually drawing\r\naway from the coast of Brazil, the bold ranges of which\r\noffered picturesque views for many miles after we had\r\npassed out of the Bay, by the southern channel, to sea.\r\n\r\nA \"pampero,\" a wind off the pampas, sprung up on 3rd",

In\r\nthe evening heavy squalls and torrents of rain came off\r\nshore, and soon the awnings were flecked with dragon-flies,\r\nmoths, and various insects sheltering from the storm on the\r\nunder surface of the canvas. A humming-bird fluttered\r\ninto the rigging--a Mother-Carey's chicken, dazed and\r\nstorm-battered, flopped over the stern railing and was\r\ncaught by one of the sailors, who handed it about for inspection.\r\nWhen it was liberated by a popular vote it came\r\non board, and could not be induced to take to its seafaring\r\nlife again. Whilst we were still four hundred miles from\r\nthe mouth of the La Plata, the colour of the sea showed the\r\ninfluence of the great river.\r\n\r\nAt eight P.M. on March 4th we anchored off the quarantine\r\nstation at Flores Island, in the sea-like expanse\r\nof the muddy La Plata. It was too late for the health\r\nofficers to visit us of course. Those officials do not stir out\r\nafter dark, and the passengers who had to land there next\r\nmorning contemplated with rueful countenances the white-*washed\r\nbarrack, built on a rocky ledge of the desolate\r\nisland, which was to be their residence for an uncertain\r\nnumber of days. As many of our friends were bound for\r\nBuenos Ayres and for the Argentine cities, there was a\r\nfarewell party or rather there were many such parties on\r\nboard the Galicia that night.\r\n\r\nNext morning the port and sanitary officers came off\r\nfrom Flores Island. The Galicia, having touched at Rio,\r\nwhich was an infected port, had exposed her passengers\r\nto the pains and penalties of quarantine. The Uruguayans\r\nare not, it is said, at all over-courteous to their Brazilian\r\nneighbours. Quarantine, if there be any pretext for it, is",

One small vestige of green on the island\r\nwas examined with wonder and satisfaction--a little field\r\nof half-an-acre in which goats, sheep, and cows were\r\nlaboriously feeding on the scanty herbage.\r\n\r\nThe medical examination was not, I am bound to say, very\r\nstrict. The emigrants for the Argentine Republic, of whom\r\nthere were some three hundred men, Italians, Spaniards,\r\n&c., women, and children, many pale, city bred, and half\r\nstarved, were mustered and passed after a brief inspection\r\non deck. I believe the cost of their maintenance is borne by\r\nGovernment, but the charge for board and lodging in quarantine\r\nat Flores Island, for ordinary passengers, is about one\r\npound a day.

Our acquaintance\r\nwith the capital was made through telescopes and opera\r\nglasses, and we only saw straight streets running up from\r\nthe river intersected by parallel lines of other streets,\r\nslaughter-houses and provision-curing establishments down\r\nby the water's edge, ships of many nations, British pre-*dominating,\r\nalong the shore, and inland the conical hill\r\noverlooking the town, from which it takes its name, \"The\r\nMountain of the Vine.\" The port authorities were kind\r\nenough to let us send letters for Europe on shore, but the\r\ncorrespondence was subjected to a preliminary drenching of\r\nsome fluid out of watering pots and big bottles to disinfect\r\nthem, which must have had a damaging effect on some of\r\nthe addresses. To make amends for the disappointment\r\nabout landing, there was a ball on board, inaugurated by\r\nColonel North, which was declared by the passengers to\r\nbe a great success, and which was given in an installation\r\ncreditable to the taste and ingenuity of the officers of the\r\nship, who converted the deck, by walls and ceilings of the\r\nflags of all nations, into a capital dancing saloon, with a\r\nbuffet, drawing-room, and boudoir, complete.\r\n\r\nWe left Monte Video early on the morning of March\r\n6th, passed Flores Island at 7.30 a.m. to the sound of M.\r\nBottoni's cornet and the farewell cheers of our quondam",

According to him there are large\r\ndistricts in the island suitable for sheep-farming, and the\r\nland taken in is increasing every year. The natives are\r\ntroublesome; so are their dogs. I suspect they are both\r\ndealt with in the same way. Seeing the \"joggle\" of the\r\nsea and the ricketty pier, I declined an invitation to land,\r\nfor which I had every reason to be grateful to myself when\r\nour party returned, full of wrath, having had their legs\r\nwet in a leaky boat, and having tumbled about in the\r\nlampless \"streets\" without seeing as much as they would\r\nhave had brought to their feet, had they remained on board.\r\n\r\nThe mails for Punta Arenas were duly landed from the\r\nGalicia and deposited in the Post Office, but the master\r\nthereof, being an official of routine and of staid habits of\r\nbusiness, declared it was too late to open the bags; whereupon\r\na mass meeting of twenty or thirty citizens resolved\r\nto storm the Post Office, and were about to do so when\r\nthe Postmaster capitulated. The traditions of the town\r\nfavour overt acts, and voies de fait. I met an old Chilian\r\nofficer who was in garrison here, in 1877, when the detenus\r\nin the then convict establishment, who were joined by\r\nsome, if not all, of the troops, rose, and committed horrible\r\noutrages; an outbreak which caused the Chilian\r\nGovernment to abandon the place as the site of their\r\npenal settlement.\r\n\r\nThere is a very obliging British Consular Officer, who\r\nis Lloyds' Agent as well, and as all steamers through the\r\nStraits touch at Punta Arenas, he might be very useful to",

Punta Arenasians,\r\nhowever, believe that with certain gold, mutton, and\r\nbread, probable water, wood, and coal, the town has a\r\npromising future.\r\n\r\nNext morning early the ship forged ahead from her\r\nmoorings and showed her stern to the Sandy Pointers who\r\nwere up. To the contentment of those who had been told\r\nthat there was little likelihood of its being clear enough\r\nto enable them to see the magnificent scenery of the Straits,\r\nthe sun shone brightly in a blue sky. Men may pass twenty\r\ntimes through the Straits of Magellan and not have one\r\nfine day. Fogs, mist, rain, prevail the greater part of the\r\nyear. We were most fortunate indeed on this 11th March.\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that it would be quite\r\nworth while to undertake the journey from Europe, in\r\norder to behold the glorious panorama of forest, mountain,\r\nand glacier which we saw unrolled in the full blaze of day\r\nwith rapture--not always silent--on either side of us, till\r\nas night fell we passed Cape Pillar on our left and breasted\r\nthe roll of the miscalled Pacific. It was our good luck to\r\nsee the beautiful combination of mighty alp; of glaciers,\r\nfringed by moraines, moving with slow \"resistless mass\"\r\nas they have done for countless ages, fed by icy mountain-breasts\r\nthousands of feet above, melting in the waters\r\nof innumerable creeks; of prim\u00e6val forest clothing the\r\nsides of lake-like inlets, up to the verge of the eternal\r\nsnow-fields--which has no rival in the world. We\r\ncould look into the blue crevasses up awful valleys lost in\r\nrecesses of rock and ice, and watch the cataracts that fell",
  "p0270.png": "into unknown gulfs hidden in clouds of mist, mile after\r\nmile, from early morn till night fell.\r\n\r\nAs the straits narrowed and the eye rested on the wooded\r\nshores of the Tierra del Fuego on one side and of Patagonia\r\non the other, it seemed at times as if the ship were embayed\r\nor hemmed in by the coasts of a fjord from which\r\n\r\nStraits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nthere was no exit. The shore of the mainland is formed by\r\na bank of shingle or a line of rocks covered with drift\r\ntimber, and at the base of the rising ground begins thick\r\nvegetation, brushwood, berberries, myrtles, calceolaria, &c.,\r\nup to the edge of the forest. The sea was calm, but squalls\r\nfrom the high land blew at times with startling suddenness.\r\nThere was a strong current from the west, and the presence\r\nof shoals of fish was indicated by the flocks of gulls, dusky\r\npetrels and the many kinds of divers, busy around us. Once",
  "p0280.png": "a great whale heaved its black bulk, spouted up a column\r\nof steam-like spray, and dived deep in front of our bows.\r\nSeals, nearer shore, popped their bullet heads above the\r\nwater or splashed off the rocks to join their busy fellows.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide opening west of Cape Froward, which\r\nis the most southern point of the American continent,\r\nwhere we were warned to look out for the Fuegian\r\nsavages. And we were not disappointed. As the ship\r\nturned a point and gave a clear view of the straits in\r\nfront, three canoes, pulling hard to cross our course, were\r\nvisible. It was rather rough in the reach, and though the\r\nsun was bright the air was sharp, and as the Galicia slowed\r\nfor the first canoe to come alongside there was an exclamation\r\nof pity and wonder from the passengers as they looked\r\ndown on its occupants.\r\n\r\nA woman with straight black hair, white teeth, and\r\ndancing black eyes, quite naked to the loins, sat in the\r\nstern of the frail craft of plank and bark, with a child in\r\nher lap, handling a clumsy, ill-shaped paddle; at her feet\r\nthere crouched a child of some three years old, naked and\r\napparently quite contented, close to the faggots and burning\r\nembers placed on the stones which served as ballast.\r\nAnother woman sat on a thwart, and plied her oar with\r\none hand, while she held out the other toward the ship,\r\nholding up a couple of otter skins, and asking for largesse,\r\nand her appeals were enforced by shrill screams for\r\n\"Bacca! bacca!\" from her companions. A man in a\r\nwhite hat, ragged blue frock coat and trousers, supplied\r\nthe falsetto to the chorus of the women. But I could not\r\nrecognise the \"Yamaschoona! yamaschoona!\" which Darwin\r\nspeaks of as Fuegian for \"Give me! give me!\"\r\nThe man was of a sickly yellow, the skin of his face\r\npuckered and withered like that of a monkey, his arms",
  "p0290.png": "were thin and muscleless, his eyes dull and unintelligent;\r\nthe women were darker hued and far more pleasant to\r\nlook upon. Their arms and limbs were round and well\r\nshaped, their shoulders were plump and full. One of our\r\nparty, an old Straits traveller, was shocked at their degenerate\r\nassumption of clothing, scant as it was. \"In\r\nmy time they had not a stitch on them!\" Certainly they\r\nhad but little now! In a cutting wind, which made us glad\r\nof our warm coats, they sat with their naked children,\r\nalmost naked themselves, smiling and happy--at least they\r\nlooked so when the ship opened a fire of biscuits, bread,\r\nfruit, old clothes, and some small missiles of tobacco, on\r\nthem. The little ones set to work at once on bananas, and\r\nthe mother clapped a fancy smoking-cap, which was flung\r\nto her, on the head of the elder. The old garments which\r\nwere thrown over to them were carefully put away, and\r\nwere not used, for the moment at all events.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other, neither they nor the Fuegians\r\nin the other canoes, three in number, which were waylaying\r\nthe Galicia and dropped alongside, would come on board,\r\nthough the port-ladder was lowered. The savages in the\r\ncanoes were all much alike, with little variety save in age,\r\nall the women with dazzling teeth, straight hair, and black\r\neyes, rather prominent cheekbones and square jaws; the\r\nyounger lusty enough, and better and stronger looking\r\nthan the men. They seemed to be aware of the fact that\r\nthey showed to more advantage than the males, for they\r\nput on far less covering of skin than their husbands or\r\nbrothers. As long as there were hopes of offers for the\r\npoor seal and otter skins and bunches of red berries they\r\nheld up, or of any gifts of bread or other edibles, they\r\nhung to the ship, never ceasing to scream \"bacca,\" \"I\r\nsay! bacca,\" and \"galieta\" or \"biscuito.\"",
  "p0300.png": "\r\nWhen the screw began to churn up the foam and\r\nthe ship gathered way the Fuegians cast off with their\r\nspoils--pumpkins, bananas, a cask of biscuit, probably\r\nnot the best, hats, coats, and the like. Those which\r\nleft us made off towards the land as fast as they could\r\npaddle, the men standing upright with outstretched arms,\r\nthe women pulling, and all no doubt yelling \"Bacca!\r\n\r\nFuegians alongside.\r\n\r\nbacca!\" in the distance. In Crooked Reach, other canoes\r\nwere seen pulling out from the shores--too late. In one\r\nthere were four women and one man, in another two\r\nwomen and two men and a boy, in another five men\r\nand women, two children, and two dogs. \"They are not\r\nChristians,\" said one of the Chilian passengers, \"nor are\r\nthey likely to become civilised, less so than ever now since\r\nthe sheep-farmers shoot them. The latter say they must",
  "p0310.png": "shoot Fuegians to prevent them stealing their sheep.\" The\r\nFuegians may--or might--say, \"We did not ask you to\r\ncome to our country with your sheep, and we can't help\r\nstealing sheep when we are hungry.\" No estimate has\r\never been made of the number of these wretched creatures,\r\nand they will probably die out rapidly now that sheep\r\nfarming has come into vogue, just as the Australians and\r\ntheir dingoes did. They have more to fear from civilisation\r\n\r\nStraits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nas it is presented to them than from their cruel natural\r\nfoes, cold and starvation. Altogether, our acquaintance\r\nwith these specimens of our fellow-man, such as it was, did\r\nnot last over half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nThe scenery from Cape Froward to Cape Pillar at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the Channel, which we passed well\r\nto our left, as I have said, just at dusk, never loses its\r\ninterest till the shores recede from sight. As we passed\r\nthe southern extremity of Smythe's Channel, those who",
  "p0320.png": "had heard of the beauty and grandeur of the scenery along\r\nits shores inside the Strait, regretted that Captain Adey\r\ndid not take this inland canal, which would have brought\r\nthe ship out into the Atlantic several hundred miles north\r\nof the Straits of Magellan, but the sagacious, careful and\r\nurbane captain explained that he would then have had to\r\nanchor every night, as it would not be safe to proceed\r\nthrough the Channel in the dark. The steamers of the\r\nKosmos line take Smythe's Channel, and passengers who\r\ndesire to see the beauties of this wonderful canal should\r\ntake the coasting German steamers, which are in no hurry\r\nand draw comparatively little water.\r\n\r\nThe Galicia, giving a wide berth to Evangelistas or\r\nDirection Island, stood out well to westward. There are\r\ncurrents off the Chilian archipelago but little known, much\r\nas the channels have been explored, which play strange\r\ntricks with sailors' reckonings.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship was out of the Straits the long roll from\r\nthe south-west created an unfavourable impression of the\r\nPacific, which was enforced by its behaviour in a gale next\r\nday. The Atlantic in \"the roaring forties\" could not have\r\nbeen worse with the same force of wind.\r\n\r\n\"The rolling of the Pacific and the waves thereof are\r\nlike those of any other sea, only more so,\" as a philosophic\r\nvoyager remarked while we were holding on by the weather\r\nrailing.\r\n\r\n\"The passage yet was good--the wind, 'tis true,\r\nWas somewhat high, but that was nothing new.\"\r\n\r\nNo land in sight, and frequent fogs, to perplex the\r\nmariner, who was, however, tolerably secure against the\r\ndangers of collision.",

Presently\r\nthe mist mounted upwards from the coast and gathered in a\r\nbank on the hillside. By the time the Galicia was moored,\r\nthe sun shone out brightly, and there, about a mile off,\r\nwas Coronel and its chimneys, showing a fair array of ships\r\nat anchor, with a pier or jetty, a Custom House, a clock\r\ntower, &c., to the best advantage, to the inquiring\r\neyes of the strangers.\r\n\r\nThe town lies in a pretty bay well sheltered from the\r\nsouth winds, which in this part of the world are accom-*",
  "p0340.png": "*panied by bad weather, and are cold and rainy. The\r\nchimneys which meet the eye on shore belong to coal mines,\r\nbrick kilns, and foundries, of which our excellent vice-consul,\r\nMr. Schw\u00e4ger, owns two. He certainly could not\r\nvery well exercise his hospitable disposition without adjuncts\r\nto the modest consular pay he receives from the\r\nForeign Office, even though it be augmented by his fee of\r\nfifteen shillings for signing the papers of the British ships\r\nwhich visit the port.\r\n\r\nThere was a great crowd of friends, many of whom had\r\ncome from Valparaiso, awaiting the arrival of the steamer\r\nto welcome Colonel North and his party, and a fleet of\r\nshore boats put off to the Galicia with strangers, among\r\nwhom I subsequently made acquaintances whose kindness I\r\nshall ever remember. But it is always a little disconcerting\r\nto find oneself in a company of old intimates and associates,\r\nof which you form no part. However, the courtesy and\r\ncordiality of those who later on became our friends soon\r\nmade us forget that we had never seen them before.\r\n\r\nLanding at the Custom House quay when the little\r\nlev\u00e9e on board ship was over, we walked along the promenade\r\nby a neatly kept Plaza with gravel walks, in the\r\ncentre of which was a pretty clock tower, decorated with a\r\nbust of Arturo Prat, to the spacious Station of the Arauco\r\nRailway, where we were to have quarters, displacing, I fear,\r\nMr. Hicks, Mr. Manby, and others during our stay. The\r\noffices of the Staff and waiting-rooms, &c., are large, airy,\r\nand well-appointed, and the residence of the officials is\r\nexceedingly comfortable.\r\n\r\nI was not prepared for the tokens of prosperity which\r\nthe little town afforded us. Factory chimneys smoked,\r\nhorsemen in ponchoes and broad sombreroes, carts laden\r\nwith sacks drawn by oxen or mules, toiled along the",
  "p0350.png": "street, enveloped in clouds of dust, and the names over\r\nthe shops--German, Italian, Spanish, and English--indicated\r\na cosmopolitan population. Altogether, Coronel\r\nwas a place beyond my expectations. When I looked\r\naround me and saw the life, the good regulations of\r\nthe port, the comparative comfort of the people, I\r\ncould not help thinking of squalid towns on the coast\r\nof an island nearer to England. There were, to be sure,\r\ndrinking-shops, pawnbroker establishments, caf\u00e9s, and possibly\r\nthe town had its other defects, but they did not rise\r\nto the eye.\r\n\r\nThe town of Coronel, called after a missionary who\r\nwas killed here in 1592 by the Indians in one of their\r\nmany desperate struggles to drive out the Spanish conquerors,\r\nis seldom named in early books of travel, and is\r\nnot to be found on most maps. It has a population of\r\nabout seven thousand people. It was not till 1851 that\r\nCoronel was elevated to the dignity of a port, and now it\r\nhas its civil governor, and its maritime sub-delegate, a\r\nhospital and a lazarette, consular representatives of the\r\ngreat Powers, telegraphic communication, not merely with\r\nChile and Peru, but with Europe and the world; and many\r\nother amenities, such as a charming climate and cheap and\r\nabundant supplies of most of the necessities of life. It was\r\npleasant to find oneself within touch of Europe again. I\r\ncould send a message to Buenos Ayres or Rio for the outer\r\nbound steamer with the latest news or a message direct\r\nto London, but the luxury was rather expensive. The\r\nmarkets are well supported with fresh fish, vegetables and\r\nmeat. Every fifteen days a Pacific mail steamer from\r\nEurope drops into the bay, and another looks in for letters\r\nand passengers home; the coasting steamers of the same\r\ncompany arrive and depart twice a week, and the Chilian",
  "p0360.png": "or South American Company's steamers communicate between\r\nCoronel and Valparaiso, and the ports on the coast\r\ntwice a week also.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Coronel, between the points of Puchoco and\r\nPlaya Negra, is a mile and a half wide. There is excellent\r\nanchorage, and with the daily increasing importance of the\r\ncommerce, and the facilities for traffic afforded by the railway,\r\nthere should be a future for the little town. There\r\nis coal, which is pursued down below the sea, at Boca de\r\nMaule and Rojas, notwithstanding some heavy blows and\r\ngreat discouragements, involving loss of life, by the incursion\r\nof the waters. There is also abundance of excellent\r\nearth for brick-making, and Coronel brick is sought\r\nfor as a building material all over a country where stone\r\nabounds. Unfortunately, rushes, reeds, plaster and mud\r\nare more easy to use than brick or stone; they are\r\nalso cheaper, and although they are surrounded with patches\r\nof cultivated land and by fruit-bearing trees, the dwellings\r\nin the outskirts of the town in which the poorer sort of\r\npeople take shelter, are of squalid and wretched appearance.\r\n\r\nThe sea swarms with fish. Some time ago the bay was\r\nvisited by shoals of smelts, or herrings, driven in fright by\r\nenemies or tired of a sea life and desirous of change, in such\r\nprodigious quantities that they formed a continuous bank\r\non the beach. With the object of converting this extraordinary\r\nsupply into oil, some enterprising gentleman\r\nerected boilers and furnaces, and prepared sheds for the\r\ncasks which were to contain the expected produce. They\r\nwaited for the fish when all was ready, but up to this time\r\nthey have waited in vain; the fish have never since\r\nappeared, or if they have done so have kept well out at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nMessrs.

But Lota is a\r\nlong way from Paris, and the stewards and the gardeners\r\nhave certainly the greater part of the enjoyment which\r\nthe property can yield out of it. The lady is perhaps\r\njustified in preferring Paris to Lota, and at all events it\r\nis very kind of her to keep up the park as well as her\r\nsplendid palazza at Santiago for the delectation of others,\r\nbut then Madame Cousi\u00f1o, who is reputed to have an income\r\nof more than a quarter of a million pounds sterling\r\nper annum, can afford a little expenditure on places outside\r\nthe sphere of her actual existence.

These discourses, and the",
  "p0430.png": "anxiety aroused by them, of course, were made known to\r\nColonel North on his arrival by his agents, and by the\r\ngentlemen in charge of the enterprises with which he was\r\nconnected on the coast. It was desirable to understand\r\nwhat was really meant by speeches which were not,\r\nperhaps, quite accurately reported, as soon as possible.\r\nOf course, Coronel was but a landing-place--the first stage\r\nin our journey.\r\n\r\nAnd so Colonel North, having visited the bridge at San\r\nPedro, inspected the Arauco Railway and examined the coal-*fields,\r\nleft Coronel with his party the third day after our arrival,\r\nby special train for San Pedro, where they took boat\r\nand were ferried across the Bio Bio to Concep\u00e7ion. They\r\nstarted late in the day. It was dark when they reached\r\nthe banks of the river, and they had a very long, cold,\r\nand unpleasant passage across, sticking on sandbanks and\r\nlosing their way in the mazes of the stream. Finally they\r\nwere carried on men's backs to shore, and arriving very\r\nmuch tired at Concep\u00e7ion, had to make a start by the\r\nearly morning train for a dusty and hot journey to\r\nSantiago. When I heard of the perip\u00e9ties of the journey,\r\nand that they would be leaving Santiago almost immediately\r\nfor Valparaiso, where the President was expected\r\npresently, I was consoled for the loss of the company I\r\nwould so soon rejoin, and I was very glad we had not\r\nundergone an ordeal which I, at any rate, could not very\r\nwell have borne. For I was unfortunate in my early\r\nacquaintance with Chile. Whilst the Galicia was off\r\nCoronel I managed to catch a cold which took possession of\r\nbody, bones, and brains, and kept me a prisoner in Mr.\r\nHicks's pleasant quarters, enveloped in porous plaster, full\r\nof coughs, pains, and indignation, \"cribb'd, cabined, and\r\nconfined.\" I was reminded of a remonstrance addressed",
  "p0440.png": "to me by my dear friend Richard Quain, M.D., for a sight\r\nof whose face I would have given many monkeys--if I\r\nhad them--when once I said \"It's only a cold,\" \"Don't\r\nsay only, as if it was of no consequence! A cold may\r\nmean a fever, and a fever may mean death; a cold is a\r\ndoor through which many enemies may enter.\" It was\r\nfortunate, indeed, that I was able to get to the famous\r\nbridge of San Pedro, the day after our arrival. This is a\r\ndetail--an unpleasant one for me.\r\n\r\nI had to content myself with what I could see of the\r\nNew World out of the windows of my room, which opened\r\non the balcony, and it was thus I formed my first impressions\r\nof Chile, physically as a country \"to look at,\"\r\nat Coronel. I am obliged to confess that they were not\r\nfavourable. There was no \"atmosphere,\" no limpid light\r\non the mountain front, no play of shade and colour on the\r\nplain. The ocean rolled solidly in heavy folds on the\r\nbeach, sent up invading columns of surf and spray against\r\nrock and bluff, and absorbed them back in foam. On the\r\nrocks and beach a uniform reddish-brown spread like a coat\r\nof paint; beyond, the strip of land extending to the base\r\nof the Andes, appeared, now, at all events, little gifted\r\nwith green. On the face of the wall-like barrier of the\r\nCordilleras rising inland to the height, apparently, of a\r\ncouple of thousand feet, there floated a mist I was destined\r\nto see for many a long day, \"the Camanchaca,\"\r\nwhich, varying in density and in depth, but never absent\r\naltogether, persistently shrouded the mountains.\r\n\r\nI watched one morning the operations of a curious branch\r\nof industry which has been found out by the Chilian boat-*men.\r\nThe men in some half-dozen boats, which at first I\r\nthought were engaged in fishing, were hauling up dredges\r\nas longshore men do nearer home. No one could have",

It appears that the colliers are loaded\r\nin the roadstead, where there is generally a considerable\r\nswell, from barges. The consequence is that coal is dropped\r\nin considerable quantities overboard, and it is suspected\r\nthat the process is facilitated by the lightermen, who, when\r\na collier has cleared out, know pretty well where to find a\r\ngood haul of coal near her moorings.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, thanks to good nursing, I was well\r\nenough to think of continuing my journey, and Mr. Milne,\r\nof Callao, who had kindly remained behind to look after\r\nus, recommended that we should proceed northwards by\r\nsea instead of going by rail to Santiago, and thence by the\r\ncontinuation of the same line to Valparaiso, on the coast.\r\nA good steamer was expected soon, and I gladly availed\r\nmyself of the chance of seeing the coast afforded by her.",

A similar disaster occurred\r\nat the colliery of Playa Negra, and these disasters intimidated\r\nthe people and effectually arrested for the time\r\nthe submarine coal-mining operations, but I believe that\r\nit is in contemplation to re-work the Coronel seams by an\r\ningenious attack upon the sea-water in the pits, which\r\nis to be cut off, section after section, from the rift which\r\nlets in the enemy, and is then to be pumped out--the\r\nseams being worked laterally so as to turn his flank also.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether miners and machinery will\r\nprevail in the combat with a terrible and persistent foe.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian Government granted a concession for a\r\nrailway to carry the coal of the various companies and\r\nindividuals who were at work, to a gentleman (Mr. Lenz),\r\nwho sold it to the Arauco (or the Concep\u00e7ion, Lota and\r\nArauco) Railway Company, which was established by\r\nMr. Edward Edmondson, Colonel, then Mr.,[**P2:, a typo?] North and\r\nothers, about four years ago, and Messrs.

Thus it was I never visited Concep\u00e7ion or\r\nsaw the railway between it and Santiago.\r\n\r\nThere are two lines of coast steamers, one belonging to\r\nthe P. S. N., the other to the Chilian Company, which, as\r\nwell as the German Kosmos steamers, ply between the most\r\nsoutherly ports of Chile and along the coast up to Panama\r\nin rather needless competition. The ships are built and\r\nengined in England, commanded and officered by Englishmen,\r\nthough they sail under different flags, and as the\r\nrailways run inland from the coast, the boats have generally\r\nfair cargoes and full cabins. Communication between the\r\ntowns on the seaboard, which are the seats of commerce\r\nand industry, is mainly carried on by the steamers, which\r\nhave a large local passenger traffic, and which are chiefly\r\nused in the transport of produce, and of the purveyors of\r\nsupplies, to the inhabitants of the rainless and barren region\r\nnorth of Coquimbo.[*] The scene presented by the main\r\ndeck of a coast steamer filled with sheep, goats, pigs,\r\npoultry, hay, straw, beans, cabbages, potatoes, locusts,\r\n\r\n* See note, Appendix.",

The steamers are the market\r\nplaces of the pacotilleros or itinerant traders, who pay their\r\nfares as passengers and a high toll as well on the produce,\r\nanimal and vegetable, with which they fill the waist of the\r\nship. The purchaser of course has the amount added to the\r\nprice of what he buys; but withal the gains are uncertain,\r\nand to judge from the aspect of the \"merchants,\" this\r\ncoast business cannot be very lucrative. In bad weather\r\nthe live stock perishes--in very bad it is thrown overboard,\r\nand is, poultry especially, sacrificed wholesale.\r\nAt the best the cattle have miserable times of it. They\r\nare slung by the horns, and are lifted and lowered on\r\nboard by cranes, in pitiable fright and pain. Indeed,\r\nthe stranger is not long in the land before he has reason\r\nto feel shocked at the usage of animals. The only\r\nmode of carrying poultry is by the legs. Half-a-dozen\r\ncocks and hens are tied together and taken through the\r\nstreets, head downwards. The oxen are driven by men\r\narmed with long poles, furnished with sharp goads which\r\nare used relentlessly, and the bits of the bridles are terribly\r\nsevere, but the formidable looking spurs of the riders are\r\nnot more punishing perhaps than an ordinary hunting\r\npersuader.\r\n\r\nThe expectations I had formed of the coast scenery were\r\ngrievously  disappointed. On the run from Coronel to",
  "p0610.png": "Valparaiso the Andes were generally hidden from view by\r\nclouds, and the coastline of rocks and bluffs, on which the\r\nnever-ceasing swell broke in foam, had little variety of\r\nform or colour. The nights were clear, the stars shining\r\nbrightly; but with the morning, fogs rolled down from the\r\nmountains and settled on land and sea. Steamers when\r\napproaching a port are often obliged to lie to.\r\n\r\nThe Chiloe was thus detained some time off Tom\u00e9, the\r\nfirst port she made the morning after we left Coronel.\r\nWhen the fog lifted off the sea, revealing the lower slopes\r\nof the mountains, and the town itself prettily situated at\r\nthe base of a series of rounded hills, covered with brushwood,\r\nrising in gradual terraces from the beach, the\r\nsummits of the range behind them were still invisible. A\r\nfew small craft riding uneasily to their anchors, a white\r\nmargin of surf, the Chilian flag, blue and white with a\r\nwhite star (colours which have been taken by Colonel\r\nNorth as his own on the turf), flying over a little Custom-House,\r\na mole, some low houses, apparently of wood, along\r\nthe beach, rounded hills covered with brush gradually swelling\r\nup into the bare ridges of the Andes--that was Tom\u00e9.\r\n\r\nPeople who go down to the sea in ships along this coast\r\nmust be thankful for small mercies in the gift of safe anchorage.\r\nTom\u00e9 is considered the best port in the great bay\r\nof Concep\u00e7ion, the points of Lobelia and Morro del Tom\u00e9\r\naffording ships some protection from the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was a fishing village till the establishment of large\r\nflour-mills in 1842 gave such an impetus to the place,\r\nthat it has now attained the dignity of being classed as a\r\nPuerto Mayor, although it has less than five thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the steamer was the signal for a rush\r\nof the people to the jetty. The port authorities, followed",
  "p0620.png": "by a flotilla, put out, and, as soon as they were allowed\r\nto board us, men and women clambered up the ladders and\r\nmade for the open market between decks, whilst the more\r\nluxurious inquired after their consignments of oysters,\r\nwhich come, I believe, from the island of Chiloe, and\r\nwhich, if somewhat inferior in contour, plumpness, and\r\nflavour to an orthodox \"native\" or Ostender, are by no\r\nmeans to be despised. They have, however, a disqualification\r\nin the eyes of very sensitive people, in that they\r\nsquirm dreadfully at the contact of lemon juice or vinegar,\r\nbut the daintiest ladies are not deterred by these outward\r\nand visible signs of suffering from eating them with gusto.\r\n\r\nThere is a good rough wine produced in the district\r\nwhich was sold for 20 centavos, the fifth part of a dollar,\r\nnow worth about 2s. 3d.; a hundred eggs cost 5s., fowls\r\n1s. 3d. a piece, and of these we laid in store. Per contra,\r\nour vegetables were in great demand as well as the oysters.\r\n\r\nA couple of hours sufficed for the business transactions\r\nbetween the port and the ship, and off we steamed to the\r\nadjacent roadstead of Talacuhano, which is the port of Concep\u00e7ion,\r\nthe imposing and picturesque-looking city we had\r\nseen from the left bank of the Bio Bio when we visited\r\nthe railway bridge. There was but little in the appearance\r\nof the Talacuhano to justify its Indian name, which\r\nmeans, I was told by one of my fellow passengers, \"a ray\r\nfrom heaven.\" The same obliging gentleman was surprised\r\nwhen I confessed that I had never heard of the\r\ncelebrated siege of the town by the Patriot army under\r\nO'Higgins, which lasted six months, nor of the deeds of\r\nthe Argentine sailor, Blanco Encalada, when in command\r\nof a Chilian flotilla hastily fitted out at Valparaiso, he\r\nboarded and captured the Spanish frigate, Maria Isabel,\r\nand two consorts in the bay, or of the gallantry of the",
  "p0630.png": "Royalist Colonel, Jos\u00e9 Ordonez, who commanded the garrison\r\nwith great ability. Every Chilian gentleman is\r\nacquainted with the details of the War of Independence,\r\nand my friend was naturally rather disappointed at my\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nThe Chiloe anchored close to the Huascar, the ironclad\r\nram which played such a conspicuous part in the war\r\nbetween Chile and Peru, but my interest in the little ship\r\narose from her encounter with the Shah and the Amethyst.\r\nThe Huascar is brig-rigged, her funnel was lowered, yards\r\nsquared, rigging taut, marines paced up and down the\r\nquarter deck and bridge, and as she lay close to us and\r\nwas low in the water, we had a good look at her and saw\r\neverything was ship shape and in strict man-of-war\r\nfashion. A formidable ram projects from her bow, and if\r\nshe struck a wooden ship she must send it to the bottom.\r\nThe result of that engagement unquestionably diminished\r\nBritish prestige along the coast. Pierola when summoned\r\nto surrender declared he would fight if he were attacked.\r\nAdmiral de Horsey did attack, and although it could not\r\nbe said he was beaten off by the Huascar, he failed to\r\ntake her, and her escape is counted by Peruvians, and,\r\nI fear, by Chilians too, as a victory. I cannot think\r\nAdmiral de Horsey exercised a sound discretion in demanding\r\nthe surrender of the Huascar without considering the\r\nmeans he had of enforcing his order if Pierola refused to\r\nobey. The Huascar was an iron-plated vessel, small\r\nindeed, but quick and handy. She was armed with\r\n300-pounders, one shot of which would have disposed of\r\nthe Shah or of her consort, the Amethyst, which was a light,\r\nslightly-armed, wooden corvette. The boilers of the former\r\nwere in a bad condition. The skipper of the Huascar was\r\nfainthearted or unskilful, and the futile attempts he made",

Much as the British residents felt the fiasco they\r\nwere very thankful indeed that the Huascar was not taken,\r\nand they are firmly convinced to-day, as I heard from\r\nmany of them, that had the Huascar been captured by the\r\nShah there would have been a massacre of the English in\r\nCallao and Lima and all the towns along the coast. Pierola,\r\nwho is now living quietly in Lima, biding his time, it is\r\nsaid, to head another revolution, became, by his resistance\r\nto the British ships, an object of popular admiration, and\r\nthe anniversary of the action is kept as a national festivity\r\nin Peru.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, anticipating a little the order of\r\nmy notes, that the mercantile community on the Pacific\r\ncoast of South America complain bitterly of the want\r\nof \"protection,\" and contrast their treatment with that of\r\nGermans, French, or Italians. They do not blame naval\r\nofficers or consular authorities so much as the Government\r\nat home, which allows grievances to remain without redress.\r\nThey say that when they make representations\r\nthat wrong has been done to their interests, the Foreign\r\nOffice sends an intimation that inquiry will be made.\r\nPresently a ship of war comes in; the officer in command\r\nlands and sees the consular officer and the sufferers. Then\r\nthe ship of war goes away and no more is heard of the\r\nmatter! Let an Italian or a German be injured and on\r\nrepresentation made to the Government reparation is made\r\nat once, although there is no German or Italian ship\r\nwithin measurable distance. Probably British merchants\r\non the coast expect too much protection. According to\r\ntheir own account they get very little indeed. During the\r\nlate war, houses, ships, warehouses, goods, property of all",

The ruins of the cities were still\r\nto be seen on the beach and on the shore near the town.\r\n\r\nWhen I beheld the evidences of the force of those irresistible\r\nconvulsions spread out before me I could not but\r\nreflect on the consequences of a similar commotion to the\r\nmagnificent bridge which by the end of this year is to span\r\nthe Bio Bio.",

This mountain range, over which\r\npeers the frosted head of the giant Aconcaqua, 23,000 feet\r\nhigh, is furrowed by deep cuts, which were doubtless the\r\nbeds of torrents when the drainage of the upland continent\r\nwas in progress, and which are still watercourses in the\r\nrainy season; between the ravines, and on the shoulders of\r\ntheir moraine-like banks, houses are built, tier above tier,\r\nthrown up, as it were, in clusters, from the long main\r\nstreet, which extends for miles along the shore, which is\r\nbordered by quays and factories. The roadstead is open\r\nto the north, and as the water is very deep the anchorage\r\nis insecure in winter when the north winds prevail, but\r\n\r\n* See note, Appendix.",

There\r\nis a battery near the south entrance, redoubts at various\r\npoints, and a fort on the hill near the Naval School, but\r\nat the beginning of the war the town was open to attack,\r\nand it is strange that the Peruvians, when they had\r\nsupremacy on the sea, did not take tithe of Valparaiso.\r\nUntil the traveller lands he has no idea of the extent of the\r\ncity which is bravely struggling--and successfully too--to\r\nwin vantage ground from the ocean. Valparaiso is ceasing\r\nto be like a mathematical line--length without breadth;\r\nthe city authorities have already retrieved many hundreds\r\nof acres from the sea, and are busily engaged in acquiring\r\nmore. Workmen are engaged in bedding out the earth\r\ninto the ocean and casting in stones of which the mountains\r\nfurnish near and inexhaustible supplies, and thus establishing\r\nfoundations for houses already rising or built on quays\r\nsimilarly constructed, so that there are now short cross\r\nstreets from the main thoroughfare, which has also small\r\noffshoots nearly parallel to its course at the Plaza and the\r\nRailway Station.\r\n\r\nThe landing is not as facile as it might be. There is, to\r\nbe sure, a fine pier projecting from the Custom House,\r\nwith boat-steps at both sides, but the steps are not all\r\neasy or in good order. There is reckless shoving and\r\nramming among the boatmen eager to land or take in their\r\npeople, accompanied by \"expostulation\" in many tongues,\r\nfor the port is the resort of ships of all nations, the\r\nmajority, however, flying the British flag. The railway\r\nruns by one side of the square[*] close at hand, and a tramway\r\nleads up to the main street and serves the whole of\r\nthe city, stopping at the lifts or accenseurs by which access\r\nis gained to the towering suburbs.\r\n\r\n* Plaza de la Intendencia, ornamented by a statue of Lord Cochrane.",

Our goods were\r\ntaken to the Custom House and were passed very promptly\r\nby one of the officers, and here I feel bound to say that my\r\nsmall experience of Chilian officials inclines me to consider\r\nthem as very polite and obliging.\r\n\r\nOur hostelry, the Hotel de France, is half way up the\r\nmain street. It is kept by a Frenchman, a great deal\r\nof a petit maitre, and, except in the matter of the bill,\r\nvery little of a landlord; his wife, who was good enough\r\nto take her meals in the salle-\u00e0-manger, where she could\r\ncriticise, if she would not attend to, her guests, was a\r\nsuitable helpmate. The internal arrangements were discreditable\r\nand abominable in every way, and a fair table\r\nand the merits of a good chef did not reconcile us to the\r\nwant of decency, not to speak of comfort, in the domestic\r\neconomy of the hotel.\r\n\r\nHow dangerous it is to prophesy, unless you are sure!\r\nMiers, who wrote an elaborate book in 1826, declared that,\r\nwhen the internal affairs of Chile were regulated, when\r\nproperty was secure and confidence was established, Concep\u00e7ion\r\nmust become the chief port of Chile, instead of\r\nValparaiso. It was a better port--supplies were cheaper,\r\nand Valparaiso can never contain more than 6,000 people.\r\n(The population now numbers probably about 120,000.)\r\nSixty years ago Valparaiso consisted of one street built only\r\non one side, and contained two shops; there was no society,\r\nno amusements, no theatre, no parade, no promenade, no\r\nroad to walk or ride upon, no exit from the town except\r\nover reefs of rocks, or barren hills, or up steep quebradas",
  "p0700.png": "(ravines), and Miers, who abuses it con spirito, declares that\r\nin spite of its matchless climate there was not \"a more\r\nuncomfortable and cheerless place of residence for a being\r\nof sense and feeling than Valparaiso.\" That was after\r\nthree centuries of Spanish rule and government!\r\n\r\nWhen the man whom the Spaniards term the \"English\r\ncorsair,\" Francis Drake, took Valparaiso, 5th December,\r\n1578, the place did not contain more than twelve or\r\nthirteen houses, a little church, and two shops; when\r\nRichard Hawkins landed, and sacked the town, in May,\r\n1594, he found some magazines and warehouses, in which\r\nwere stored silk, linen, wine, and provisions, and in one of\r\nthe four ships in the Roads which he plundered he found a\r\ngood quantity of gold.\r\n\r\nTo-day there is a great commercial port with wet docks,\r\npiers, quays, warehouses, magazines--a bustling active\r\npopulation--colleges, schools, well-stored shops of every\r\nkind, hotels, theatres, clubs, tramways, railways, public carriages,\r\nelectric lighting, gas, the telephone. But little more\r\nthan a hundred years before Miers' time Valparaiso consisted\r\nof about one hundred poor houses without any\r\norder, sheltering one hundred and fifty families, scarce\r\nthirty of whom were whites. The most Chilian of\r\nChilians must admit that but for the enterprise and capital\r\nof the European and American, German, English, Yankee\r\nmerchants, engineers, traders, &c., Valparaiso would have\r\nhad to wait for many a weary year ere it would have\r\nattained to the degree of civilised activity which it presents\r\nto-day. The most patriotic Spaniard cannot deny that his\r\nancestors were miserable administrators of the regions they\r\nwon by so much expenditure of energy and courage.\r\n\r\nValparaiso, the supremacy of which was challenged at\r\none time by Callao, is now, without doubt, the principal",
  "p0710.png": "port on the west coast of South America. The roadstead\r\nis capable of containing more than one hundred vessels,\r\nwith good holding ground, and they are generally pretty\r\nsafe; but the water is very deep, the bay is exposed\r\nto a heavy run of the sea when the wind is from the\r\ncuarto cuadrante, \"and vessels at anchor must ride to\r\neighty fathoms of cable at least, with the same distance\r\nbetween each.\" Notwithstanding every precaution that\r\ncan be taken, there is a series of disasters--vessels driven\r\nashore, collisions, wrecks--every year. The wind from the\r\nsouth, which is mild and genial in most parts of the world,\r\nis in every way detestable along the coast from Cape\r\nHorn upwards, and its prevalence at Valparaiso is a\r\nserious disadvantage; but the port is so well placed,\r\nand it has been so much improved, and provided with\r\nsuch accommodation for shipping and merchandise, that\r\nits trade is likely to increase rather than to diminish.\r\nNot only the products of Chile, but those of Bolivia and\r\nPeru--sugar, wool, guano, nitrates, cotton, minerals of all\r\nkinds--find here a convenient outlet. The police of the\r\nport is efficacious, the sanitary service excellent, and the\r\nshipping expenses are declared by the authorities to be as\r\nlow as possible; whereat ship captains shake their heads--if\r\nthey do no worse--and shipowners and merchants are\r\nentirely incredulous.\r\n\r\nThe most serious blow to the rising prosperity of\r\nValparaiso was delivered by the hand of Spain. On 31st\r\nMarch, 1866, the Spanish squadron bombarded the city,\r\neffected great ruin, and destroyed property to the amount\r\nof 12,000,000 dollars, some say far more.\r\n\r\nTo guard against a similar visitation the Government\r\nhave constructed a series of forts at dominant points\r\ncommanding the bay, named Rancaqua, Talcahuano, Yer-*",

At certain points there are lifts for the\r\nconvenience of the suburbs, if so they may be called,\r\nperched on the spurs of the hill right above the town.\r\n\r\nMany things might be said to the disparagement of\r\nValparaiso--the atrocious pavement of the streets and trottoirs,\r\nthe exorbitant prices in the shops, the foul purlieus\r\nand the drinking dens on the quays; but there is much\r\nto admire in the well-conducted hospitals, the charitable\r\nand educational institutions, the libraries, schools, and\r\npublic buildings; the facilities for locomotion, the lighting\r\nand police of the streets, the extension of electric lighting\r\nand acoustics, the telephone, the tram-car, and the railway.\r\n\r\nSome authorities assert that it was named by the\r\nfounder, Saavedra, in memory of his birthplace in Spain,\r\nbut Chilians who have taken trouble to inquire into the\r\norigin of it are of the opinion that the name was given\r\nby the first Spaniards who visited the port in a ship\r\nfrom Peru in September (1543), in the beginning of\r\nthe spring, when the hills were covered with green and\r\nthe valley of the Quintil, now the Almendral (Almondry),\r\nwas in full bloom of flowers and rich vegetation, so that the\r\nstrangers who had just coasted the dry, brown, waterless\r\nshores of the long stretch from the north, struck by the\r\ncontrast, believed that they were in a very Vale of\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nIt would, perhaps, be impertinent to inquire how much",
  "p0730.png": "of the present prosperity of the port is due to the\r\nforeigners, who constitute to-day an important section of\r\nthe citizens and inhabitants of the place.

She still\r\n\r\n* Frezier mentions that he found at Talcuhano, in 1713, the Mary Anne of\r\nMarseilles, Commander Sieur Pipon of Villafranca; and the Concord, Sieur\r\nPrauclet Daniel, of St. Malo, with booty from Rio, sent by M. du Guys'\r\nsquadron; the Virgin of Grace and the Concord at Valparaiso, loading corn for\r\nCallao; at Arica, a ship of freight, M. de Russy; at Pisco, the Princess Conde\r\nMartin, from Emoi, in China, and the St. Margaret from St. Malo; at Callao,\r\ntwo ships of St. Malo, and the Mary Anne of Marseilles again, and a prize the\r\nSieur Brignon of St. Malo sold to the Viceroy for 1,000 pieces of eight. Of\r\ncourse these names are anglicised from the French text.",

French modistes, tailors, shoemakers, perruquiers,\r\nhair-cutters, French musicians and dancing masters,\r\nFrench restaurants are in the van, but as merchants and\r\nbankers Frenchmen are in the rear. There are some great\r\nFrench commercial houses in the copper and nitrate trades,\r\nand in all that decorates life Frenchmen are potent agents,\r\nbut they have relinquished their grip on the West Coast. In\r\nwalking through the streets of Valparaiso one sees on the\r\nbrass plates on the doors, which denote the seats of custom,\r\nbut few French names. For one French there are three\r\nGerman, and as far as I could judge there are more\r\nGermans than there are English; all other nationalities,\r\nItalian, Spanish, American together, do not equal, perhaps,\r\neither the German or the English. Insurance, life\r\nand fire companies, banks, agencies, are largely in the\r\nhands of Chilians. Americans like Wheelwright, Meig,\r\nand others, have done much for Valparaiso, Chile, and\r\nthemselves, in railways, public works, and manufacture, but\r\nEnglish and Germans, I should think, \"hold the fort\" and\r\nhave the largest grasp of the inner life of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that the foreign communities in the\r\nlarge towns should generally keep very much to themselves.\r\nIt is certain that they do so in Valparaiso. There is\r\na German life quite distinct from the English life. The\r\nItalians stand apart from both. Perhaps the French do\r\nthe same. The English Club is not frequented by any\r\nbut English, and the German Club is used only by Germans.\r\nThere are English, German, Italian and American\r\ndoctors with their national client\u00e8le. There is a Chilian\r\nClub very hospitable to strangers. But strangers visit it as\r\nrarely as natives visit the clubs of aliens in their midst.",
  "p0760.png": "At the exchange, the bourse, and the quay all these\r\ngentlemen, foreign and native, meet as business men,\r\nbut out of business they have generally no relations.\r\nIt is said that the Germans have a remarkable facility in\r\nlearning Spanish, and I believe the saying is true. But I\r\nhave reason to think that the number of Englishmen who\r\nmarry Chilian women, though it is small, is far greater\r\nthan the number of Germans who seek wives among the\r\nnatives of the country. They have their musical reunions,\r\ntheir kneips, and their fire brigades, and as far as they\r\ncan, they carry about the manners and customs of the\r\nFatherland with them, but they are not quite so prone\r\nas the English to marry and settle in the country.\r\nEnglish names are borne by men high in the service of\r\nthe State, and by politicians and landowners the descendants\r\nof English, Irish, and Scotch, who married Chilian\r\nladies and settled in the country, and who for the most\r\npart, if not always, became intensely Chilian in feeling, and\r\ngenerally adopted the religion of the people.\r\n\r\nThere is a very well-informed and enterprising public\r\npress, with able writers and correspondents, and at a\r\ndejeuner given to the representatives of the Valparaiso\r\nnewspapers at the Hotel de France by Colonel North, I\r\nmade the acquaintance of several gentlemen who were\r\ntypes of the best sort of American journalist. Although\r\nthe papers represented different shades of Chilian politics\r\nand opinion, they all agreed in strong opposition to the\r\nGovernment of the day.\r\n\r\nLooking up and down the long table in the salle-\u00e0-manger\r\nI was struck by the intelligent heads, bright expression,\r\nand pleasing faces of the company, faultlessly\r\ndressed, white-cravated and black-coated. And what a\r\ngift of speech these gentlemen had! One after the other",
  "p0770.png": "they started up, glass in hand, and rolled out in sonorous\r\nphrase what they thought it was incumbent upon them to\r\nsay on the occasion. Words, mere words, perhaps, but\r\nfinely sounding and ear-catching! How much better, for\r\nexample, \"caballeros\" sounds than \"gentlemen\"? How\r\npleasant it was to be able to recognise old Latin friends\r\nunder the rich mantle cast over them in a country\r\nwhere it had undergone not ungraceful or inharmonious\r\nmutations.\r\n\r\nIt is in remote places, Cuba, Manilla, &c., that a traveller\r\nfirst learns to appreciate the range and influence of the\r\nSpanish language. On the South American Continent it is\r\nparamount. With the exception of Brazil, where the\r\nyounger, and as the Spaniards say, illegitimate, brother of\r\nthe Castilian, has his way, Spanish is the mother-tongue\r\nover the whole Continent of South America, of Central\r\nAmerica, in Lower California, and in Mexico.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of one gentleman on the staff of La\r\nUnion, there was not one of our press friends who spoke\r\nEnglish, and very few could converse in French.\r\n\r\nIt is averred that though the Chilians write Spanish\r\nvery well, they speak and pronounce it badly; but it\r\nwould need a practised ear indeed to detect any difference\r\nbetween a Chilian and Peruvian using the same words.\r\nNevertheless, each province over the whole continent has\r\nits characteristic phrases and pronunciation. Though the\r\nliberty of the Press in Chile is absolute, it is not above\r\nthe law, and there are ways, it is said, of \"nobbling it\"\r\nknown to politicians.\r\n\r\nNothing can be prettier in their way than some of the\r\nlittle maisons de campagne of the merchants, built ch\u00e2let-*wise\r\nin the midst of gardens which are bevelled out of the\r\nside of the rising ground, girdled in with trees, the trellis-*",

Such I saw at Las Sorres, Mr. Berry's\r\n\"the Foxes\" [they actually had a pack of hounds and\r\nhunted the Chilian reynards over the worst-looking country\r\nthat ever lamed horse or dog], and at Mr. Raby's,\r\n&c.

I am aware that\r\nthere are to be found nearer home scenes of misery, squalor,\r\nvice and drunkenness, but the purlieus of this city offend\r\nevery sense at least as much as those of any I have ever\r\nseen. They are peopled by a heterogeneous mass, indigenous\r\nand foreign. They seem to have come in swarms like\r\ninsects, carrying with them the d\u00e9bris of rotten tenements,\r\nof dust-heaps, deserted slums, rag shops, marine dealers'\r\nstores--all kinds of odds and ends of planks, doors, window-frames,\r\npieces of zinc, and corrugated iron, sacking, tiles,\r\niron piping, &c.--to have cast them down on the hill spurs\r\nand in the ravines--and to have established their suburbs\r\nas they listed, each swarm in its own nook.

There was a combination of religious\r\nobservances and popular f\u00eate days at the time, and besides\r\nthat there was a great mortality among the children, and\r\nthe Chilians--so I heard again and again--are quite content\r\nwhen their children die, and celebrate the decease\r\nby liberal entertainment and carousal.\r\n\r\nThere is one drawback from the formation of the land\r\nwhich the rich and poor experience in common. It is\r\nnot inconsiderable. The hills are of red clay, and in\r\nmany places there is little vegetation to bind the surface.\r\nA house or a garden or a shanty settlement now and then\r\nwill slide down a hill-side or ravine, and tumble in ruin at\r\nthe bottom, carrying along whatever is in the way. The\r\nconstruction of the poorer edifices offers facilities for such\r\ncollapse.

Se\u00f1or Balmaceda was on his way to Santiago\r\nafter the progress through the centres of Chilian life and\r\nof European industry and enterprise, in the course of\r\nwhich he had delivered the speeches which, as I have\r\nsaid, had been regarded as the pronunciamientoes of a\r\nnew policy--\"Chile for the Chilians.\" It was known that\r\nColonel North had come from Europe to solidify and to\r\nextend interests, in respect to any increase of which President\r\nBalmaceda's programme, as reported, might be taken\r\nas adverse. It was not known how far the reports of the\r\nPresident's discourses were correct, but it might be inferred\r\nthat they were not all accurate, because he had already\r\nfound it necessary to make a formal correction of, and to\r\nexplain away, one important passage which had caused\r\nserious uneasiness.\r\n\r\nOn the day named Colonel North, Mr. Spencer, Mr.\r\nPrior, and myself went by train to the station of Vi\u00f1a\r\ndel Mar, where the senior aide-de-camp was in waiting to\r\nreceive and conduct us to the villa in which the President",
  "p0820.png": "was lodged. There was no show of sentries at the gate;\r\nin the hall there were two officers in undress uniform, by\r\nwhom we were shown into the boudoir on the ground-floor,\r\nwhere Balmaceda was awaiting his visitors. He is a\r\nstraight, spare, well-built man, with a keen, finely-cut\r\nface--an intellectual forehead, and quick, penetrating\r\neyes--a mobile mouth with a subtle little smile, and he\r\nhas the most easy, charming manner possible, and a\r\ncordiality which made us quite at our ease in the causerie\r\nwhich ensued. The conversation was carried on in\r\nSpanish and English, which Mr. Dawson translated for\r\nboth sides. The President does not speak any language\r\nbut Spanish, but he said he understood French. \"After\r\ncompliments,\" as they say in the translation of Oriental\r\ndocuments, the President declared that he was desirous of\r\ngiving every facility to the introduction of foreign capital\r\nin developing the resources of the country, and the gist\r\nof the interview was that he had not the smallest intention\r\nof making war on vested interests. He was especially\r\nfull of praise for the Nitrate Railway, which he had visited\r\nat Iquique, and he said \"he considered it a complete model\r\nof good management and organization.\"\r\n\r\nColonel North was very much gratified by the assurances\r\nof President Balmaceda, and, in view of the interpretation\r\nwhich had been placed on the speeches to which I have\r\nalluded, the interview was, in fact, most satisfactory to him.\r\nThere were, however, signs and tokens that the early\r\ndeclarations of policy respecting the State properties, attributed\r\nto Balmaceda, were considered by the press to be\r\nthe guiding principles of the Government, and that for the\r\nfuture railway extension was to be reserved for the State.\r\n\r\nAll the papers in Valparaiso were, at the time, in opposition.\r\nEach had some particular grief against that par-*",

Except in the heat of electioneering and party\r\ncontests, personal attacks on the President are not common--he\r\nis smitten through the body of the minister. Ere I\r\nhad been many days in the country, I had occasion to\r\nremark the frequency and number of decrees issuing from\r\nthe Ministers' bureau signed \"Balmaceda,\" many of them\r\nof very great importance. Considering how nearly despotic\r\nthe President's powers are, there is rather an excess of\r\ncourtesy than a want of moral courage manifested in the\r\ncriticism of Government in the Chilian newspapers. Ere\r\nI left the country there were signs in the press of a strong\r\nfeeling that the powers of the President were exercised\r\nin a manner, especially in decrees touching expenditure\r\nand finance, which trenched upon constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nWhen the Esmeralda was sunk off Iquique in the famous\r\naction of which the Chilians are so proud, Colonel North\r\nconceived the idea of converting the capstan which had\r\nbeen taken out of the wreck into a trophy and of presenting\r\nit to the President of the Republic. He had it\r\nmounted accordingly by Messrs. Elkington as a shield, with\r\nrelievos of great artistic excellence representing the incidents\r\nof the combat. It was arranged that the President\r\nshould receive this shield in the name of the State\r\nand deposit it in the Hall of the National Assembly at\r\nSantiago. The brass top of the capstan is surrounded by a\r\nsilver border decorated with raised stars, inside which are\r\nsmall discs bearing the names of those who perished in the\r\naction of the 21st May, 1879, which date is inscribed at the\r\ntop of the shield. Four allegorical figures in relief surround\r\nthe capstan, the centre of which bears the Chilian\r\nstar, and the words, \"Esmeralda--Chile.\" Below the capstan\r\ntwo figures, \"Peace and Prosperity,\" sustain a shield",
  "p0840.png": "bearing the names of \"Prat--Urribe, Serrano--Sanchez--Wilson--Fernandez--Zegerz--Riquelme,\r\nand Hurtado.\" A\r\nreplica or two intended for the Municipality of Iquique, &c.,\r\nwere lost in the Cotopaxi. Colonel North also brought out\r\nfrom England, in the Galicia, to improve the breed of\r\nhorses, a thorough-bred stallion and a very fine sire of the\r\nCleveland type, purchased from Mr. Burdett-Coutts' stud,\r\nwhich he designed for the public service, and these were\r\nlater on handed over to the Government at Santiago.\r\n\r\nThe President was good enough to say to me that when\r\nI came to Santiago he would take care that all the information\r\nin the possession of the departments of state would be\r\nplaced at my disposal. \"We desire nothing more than the\r\npublication of the truth, and are anxious that Chile\r\nshould be made known to the world as it is.\"\r\n\r\nExcursions, the theatre, correspondence, visiting, and\r\nreceiving visits, luncheons and banquets, balls and dances,\r\nenabled the party to spend a week at Valparaiso without\r\ntaking much note of time. Every day contact with our\r\nmother earth at home was renewed by the electric telegraph,\r\nwhich brought us news of the price of stocks and shares in\r\nLondon and Liverpool, and regulated the rate of exchange.\r\n\r\nDuring the American War I lived for some months \"on\r\nmy exchange,\" that is, I received so much paper for the\r\ngold I brought out that I paid my expenses. It is said that\r\nthere are people who live on the \"exchange\" in Valparaiso.\r\nBut that is quite a different matter. I daresay that a\r\nperson of ordinary intelligence who applies himself to the\r\nsubject may come to understand the rationale of Chilian\r\nexchange. I confess it was beyond me. The results were\r\nplain enough, the mode of arriving at them mysterious.\r\nOne day, I went to a banker to change a circular note\r\nof Messrs. Coutts, and I received the equivalent in paper",
  "p0850.png": "of Chile at the rate of 27-1/2d. to the dollar. A few days\r\nafterwards I changed another circular note; the exchange\r\nhad gone down or up--the dollar was reckoned at something\r\nless than 26d. The exchange question, therefore,\r\nenters instantly and closely into every business transaction\r\nin every town of Chile.\r\n\r\nThe firm which has early and exclusive intelligence of the\r\nrates in Europe holds a trump card, but the arrangements for\r\nthe daily diffusion of telegraphic intelligence on this head\r\nare so good that the general public have, as a rule, as good\r\ninformation as the great merchants. When the paper is\r\nposted up in the club there is a great rush. \"What is\r\ncopper? How are nitrates?\" and so forth. It was an\r\nanxious time. One of the great industries of Chile was\r\nthreatened with serious harm; the news of the mischief\r\ndone to the copper market by the operations of the Paris\r\nsyndicate was most alarming. And the circumstance that\r\nit was a French combination which had occasioned so\r\nmuch loss and disturbance did not mitigate the strong\r\nexpressions which were committed by Germans and English\r\nto its doors.\r\n\r\nWhen we had exhausted all the resources of Valparaiso\r\nin the way of amusement, and, as far as I was concerned,\r\nof information, it was time to proceed to Santiago, where\r\nsome of the ministers were already in residence to arrange\r\nthe business which Colonel North had in hand ere we\r\nproceeded to the Pampas of Tarapac\u00e1. So when the customary\r\ntribute of sittings to the photographers had been\r\npaid, and groups and portraits had been duly ordered and\r\npaid for too, we shook the dust--and there was plenty of\r\nit--of the H\u00f4tel de France off our feet, and took train for\r\nSantiago. I have already alluded to the proprietor of the\r\nhotel. The descent of the Assyrian on the Colonel was",

  "p0880.png": "24th February, 1541, he divided the ground into squares,\r\neach containing 4,096 toises, a fourth of which he allowed\r\nto every citizen; and to protect the infant settlement\r\nhe built a fort upon the hill of Santa Lucia,\r\nwhich the Indians never ceased to assail for six years,\r\nkeeping the Spaniards closely besieged and compelling\r\nthem to live upon loathsome viands and on the little grain\r\nthey could raise under the cannon of the place.

There are, no doubt,\r\nvery considerable difficulties in the way of laying down\r\ngood street pavement in Santiago; the soil is soft sand;\r\nthere is no rain for months. The mode of paving in\r\nfavour with the authorities consists in laying water-worn\r\nstones, which are procurable in any number from the bed\r\nof the river, round, of course, and about the size of a\r\nsix-pound shot, on the surface of the ground without any\r\nbinding.

The rock,\r\nnow the scene of breakfasts, dinners, festive meetings,\r\nand dances, and which has moreover an enormous theatre\r\nclose to the restaurant, has special historical interest for\r\nChilians, as it was the main stronghold of the Spaniards\r\nagainst their implacable enemies the Indians in the early",

Though the springs are only a few\r\nyards apart they have very different temperatures, and this\r\nappears to be the result of an unequal mixture of cold\r\nwater; for those with the lowest temperature have scarcely\r\nany mineral taste. After the great earthquake of 1822\r\nthe springs ceased and the water did not return for nearly\r\na year. They were also much affected by the earthquake\r\nof 1835, the temperature being suddenly changed from\r\n118\u00b0 to 92\u00b0. It seems probable that mineral waters, rising\r\ndeep from the bowels of the earth, would always be more\r\nderanged by subterranean disturbances than those nearer\r\nthe surface. The man who had charge of the baths assured\r\nme that in summer the water is hotter and more plentiful\r\nthan in winter. The former circumstance I should have\r\nexpected from the less mixture, during the dry season, of\r\ncold water; but the latter statement appears very strange\r\nand contradictory. The periodical increase during the\r\nsummer when rain never falls can, I think, only be accounted\r\nfor by the melting of the snow, yet the mountains",

I have no reason\r\nto doubt the accuracy of my informer who, having lived\r\non the spot for several years, ought to be well acquainted\r\nwith the circumstance, which, if true, certainly is very\r\ncurious, for we must suppose that the snow-water, being\r\nconducted through porous strata to the regions of heat, is\r\nagain thrown up to the surface by the line of dislocated\r\nand injected rocks at Cauquenes; and the regularity of the\r\nphenomenon would seem to indicate that in this district\r\nheated rock occurred at a depth not very great.\"\r\n\r\nThe waters contain chloride of calcium and of sodium, a\r\ntrace of chloride of magnesia, sulphate of lime, sesquioxide\r\nof iron and alumina and of silex, bromide of magnesia,\r\nchloride of potass, &c. According to the guide book, and\r\nthe advertisements, they are most potent in rheumatism,\r\nthroat affections, and eczema--in fact, in most of\r\nthe ills that flesh is heir to or that it acquires for itself.\r\nAlthough there was nothing in particular the matter with\r\nme, to pass the time I took one of the mineral baths every\r\nday, and was none the worse for it.

The\r\nEnglish and the Chilians soon after our arrival organized a\r\nf\u00eate champetre at a romantic spot near the village of Cauquenes.\r\nSupplies of provisions were sent on in advance.\r\nThe visitors set out in country carts, into which beds and\r\ncushions were placed to ease the jolting. Each waggon\r\nwas drawn by six oxen, which went at a fair trot. The\r\nmen took their guns in expectation of sport, and got a few\r\npartridges. The natives and the strangers fraternized most\r\nwarmly, and song and dance wound up the pleasures of the\r\nday--indeed the people we met in our travels always\r\nseemed ready to join in any junketing in their way.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of a large estate in the neighbourhood,\r\nSe\u00f1or Soto, whose brother was at the picnic, invited the\r\nstrangers to come over to witness the herding and lassoing\r\nof cattle, of which he owns many thousands, and to give\r\nus an insight into Chilian country life, and the following\r\nday we set out from the hotel on wheels and horseback\r\naccordingly. As our cort\u00e8ge, enveloped in the inevitable",
  "p1080.png": "dust, after an hour's drive, came in sight of a plain in\r\nwhich there was a large lake fringed deeply with bulrushes,\r\nthirty or forty horsemen emerged from the cover\r\nof a wood, with loud cries, and galloped in single file\r\ntowards a long wall above which we could distinguish\r\na forest of horns. These cowherds, or vaqueros, managing\r\ntheir spirited, active, little horses with perfect skill\r\nand ease--every man with a lasso on his saddle bow--wore\r\nmany-coloured ponchos, and were dressed with\r\nsashes round their waists, short jackets, big boots or\r\nmany buckled gaiters, and heavy spurs, in a picturesque\r\nfashion. Se\u00f1or Soto and Mr. Reed, the naturalist and owner\r\nof the English books we had seen at the store house\r\nin the village, were awaiting our arrival. Se\u00f1or Soto has\r\ntravelled much, is well read, and speaks several languages;\r\nand as his estates adjoin the road to the much-frequented\r\nbaths of Cauquenes, he is in constant touch with the world,\r\nliving, it is true, somewhat apart from it, content with the\r\nmanagement of his flocks and herds--the horses in the\r\nplain and the cattle on the hills.[*] He wished first to show\r\nhow the vaqueros separated any particular animal from\r\nthe herd, and how the cattle--all but wild, as they were\r\ndriven in from the mountains where they pastured--were\r\ncoralled--driven into enclosures, surrounded by walls of\r\nadobe, to be branded and marked or to be picked out for\r\ndispatch to the market towns. The manner in which a\r\ncouple of vaqueros riding into a corral, among a herd of\r\nhalf-wild animals, managed to extricate, so to speak, from\r\nthe agitated herd any one animal which we indicated was\r\na triumph of united action of man and horse, for the two\r\n\r\n* Se\u00f1or Soto has good cattle--1,150 horses on feed. These are tended by\r\n190 vaqueros. Each of these has two acres of land to cultivate, and is paid\r\nwages for his work. There are 500 families on the estate. There are also\r\nmany thousands of sheep on the farm.",
  "p1090.png": "worked together--the horsemen pressing their way through\r\nthe herd, keeping one at each side of their victim till it\r\nwas, after repeated attempts to get away, headed and forced\r\nout of the corral. But they were not always successful at\r\nthe first attempt, and the other vaqueros, who were drawn\r\nup in line like a wall, to prevent the animals breaking\r\nthrough, enjoyed the failure. The work was accompanied\r\nby considerable shouting.[*] Man and horse are to the\r\nmanner born; there cannot be a finer raw material for\r\ncavalry than the Chilian peasantry in the world.\r\n\r\nThen we rode to a knoll, wooded at the base, commanding\r\na view of the plain and of the marsh, over which\r\nflocks of divers and duck were wheeling and rising out of\r\nthe tall reeds, but, as our sportsmen found, inaccessible to\r\nshot. Among the beds men, deep in mud and water, were\r\ncutting and stacking the reeds, which are now fit for the\r\nmarket. They are most valuable in a country where walls\r\nand houses are constructed of reeds, plastered; and we met\r\nmany ox carts laden with piles of them from Se\u00f1or Soto's\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nIn the plains there were herds of wild-looking cattle at\r\npasture, and vaqueros were sent down to lasso the runaway\r\ncattle of different tempers--some resisting passively, others\r\nfiercely and actively, when caught by horn or heel at discretion.\r\nThe operation has been often described, but to\r\nunderstand the precision of eye and hand, the judgment of\r\ndistance and of speed, and the neatness of it, one must see\r\nit in practice. When many illustrations of the skill of\r\nthe accomplished cowherds had been given we had an exhibition\r\nof their cleverness in collecting or dividing the herds.\r\n\r\nLuncheon in a shed on the hill followed, and then two\r\nwomen, one rather good-looking, and aware of the fact,\r\n\r\n* See note, Appendix.",
  "p1100.png": "and both attired in European fashion, who were seated outside,\r\nguitar in hand, sang middling well two or three songs\r\nover and over again, and presently the song was hushed,\r\nand gave place to the dance--the Samacuecca, the very\r\npretty and characteristic dance which English people call\r\n\"the quaker,\" for a description of which see everyone's\r\ntravels passim.\r\n\r\nI asked a friend \"if there was a house on the estate?\"\r\nfor I could not understand why we were entertained in a\r\nbarn. \"Yes, of course! Se\u00f1or Soto lives there.\" \"I\r\nsuppose it's a long way off?\" \"No! not at all.\" \"I\r\nwonder why he does not invite us there?\" \"Hush, it's\r\nnever done in Chili--at least, most rarely--and probably\r\nthe family are not at home.\" Our host, with an escort of\r\nvaqueros--galloping madly in clouds of dust, accompanied\r\nour party back to Cauquenes, and whilst the horses were\r\nresting at the village the Chilian horsemen amused themselves\r\nand us by playing at \"barriers.\" The game is\r\nplayed by two men or two parties who strive to force their\r\nhorses, jammed as close as they can go against a wall or\r\na fence, inside those of the other side. The horses enter\r\ninto the sport, and it was delightful to watch one clever\r\nlittle mare putting her head below her rival's neck, and\r\nthen prizing her head up, to win the victory for her rider.\r\nThe champion in these games was a picturesque and dirty\r\nold fellow, who said he was seventy, and looked more,\r\nbut who danced the \"quaker\" as well as anybody. He\r\nhad his horse in perfect control, and though he was\r\nnearly unhorsed in one violent scrimmage, recovered\r\nhis seat gallantly.\r\n\r\nIn England we are too apt, because our squires and\r\nfarmers are fond of hunting and our breed of horses is unrivalled,\r\nto consider ourselves an exclusively equestrian",

In Chile the population generally lives in the\r\nsaddle, and in such a country these horsemen ought to be\r\ninvincible under good leaders, and they proved that they\r\nhad courage as well as skill before Lima.\r\n\r\nBy the time we entered the avenue of the Baths after a\r\nbreak-neck drive down and up and across rivulets and over\r\nriver beds, very much pleased and very tired, with many\r\nkind recollections of Se\u00f1or Soto's reception, it was late at\r\nnight.

All human needs had their spokeswomen.\r\nSisters wanted help for their hospitals, nurses for\r\ntheir foundlings, music mistresses for their schools. One\r\ngentleman urged the Nitrate King to finance a revolution in\r\na neighbouring state. The papers had published biographies\r\nand portraits of the Nitrate King in every town, and the\r\nreport of his enormous wealth had gone abroad among the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOne morning, there came an old gentleman--the only\r\none of the many who appeared day after day--that I would\r\nhave helped. He had, after an adventurous career in\r\nPortugal, &c., settled in Valparaiso some half century\r\nago and founded the first English seminary in the city.\r\nHe obtained an excellent position, was held in much\r\nesteem by the leading men of the Republic, amassed a\r\nlittle fortune, and then, carried away by the rush for",
  "p1230.png": "mining enterprises, which swept half Chile off its legs,\r\nembarked his capital, which foundered and sank, in shafts\r\nand lodes somewhere near Autofagasta I think, and left\r\nhim struggling for dear life. He fought for years, but\r\nnever won, and now, having lost all his early friends--\"Harry\r\nKeppel, I know, would be sorry to hear of my\r\nsituation\"--he was reduced to poverty, and was selling off\r\nthe little that remained of the possessions he had acquired\r\nin prosperous days, some Latin classics, a Milton's \"Paradise\r\nLost,\" second edition, published in the lifetime of the\r\npoet, a Galignani Byron, &c.--on which he placed an exaggerated\r\nvalue. The Milton alone found a buyer.\r\n\r\nTouched by sympathy for a countryman in distress, our\r\nparty made up a small subscription, which Mr. Blank took,\r\nI suppose, without reflection, for in a day or two the notes\r\ncame back with a letter of thanks of the curtest--\"he\r\nwanted to sell his books\"--voil\u00e0 tout!\r\n\r\nA Chilian gentleman to whom I mentioned the chasse au\r\nColonel thought it quite natural. \"The people are extremely\r\ncharitable among themselves.

But they will not feel very angry if they\r\nare refused. They are excellent askers, givers, and takers.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a felicitous illustration of the value of the\r\nprecept to be all things to all men afforded in the case of\r\ntwo respectable ecclesiastics who came one day to ask for a",

My friend, Captain Harris, had his gig alongside\r\nthe jetty steps, and put my wife and myself, after some\r\ndifficulty in shipping the feminine part of his cargo,\r\nsafely on board the Pacific Steam Navigation Company's\r\nsteamer Serena, of 2,500 tons, Captain Vaughan. She\r\nwas crowded with passengers, many going to Europe,\r\nwhich, in the case of most of them, meant the Paris Exhibition.\r\nThe revellers at the ball of the night before, the\r\nmembers of the clubs, the friends and acquaintances of\r\nColonel North and his party crowded the quarter-deck and\r\nfilled the saloon to say \"good-bye.\" Then came libations\r\nof the vin d'honneur and feeling speeches, kindly words, and\r\nthe final adieux.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock p.m., the Serena moved ahead, with a\r\nflotilla of boats filled with people cheering and waving\r\nhats and handkerchiefs, in her wake. She stood out to sea,\r\nand having given a good offing to the projecting headland,",
  "p1290.png": "steered north on her course. Once past the northern\r\nheadland of the bay we encountered the gentle roll of the\r\nPacific, which was blazing in the rays of the declining\r\nsun to the west like a sea of fire. To the east the snow-*white\r\ncrest of Aconcagua was just visible, towering high\r\nabove the mist on the lower ranges of the Andes. It might\r\nwell have been a patch of cloud floating in the grey air.\r\nAll next day we ran northwards along the coast. There\r\nwas little to see save black reefs and the red beach, and\r\nsandhills beyond them. The uniform dulness and the\r\nmonotonous appearance of the shore are irritating. A\r\nbrick-coloured wall of irregular contour and height, rising\r\nfrom the sea in slopes or terraces, or abrupt cliffs, a fringe\r\nof rocks and reefs at the base of which the surf rolls for\r\never! No sign of vegetation or of life! We searched the\r\nrecesses of the chain with the glass for sign of habitation\r\nor cultivation in vain. Inside that wall of brick-coloured\r\nrock there are mines of copper, hills covered with sheep,\r\nand in the plains between the mountain chains there are\r\nfields of wheat and barley, and all these find outlets in\r\nports close at hand, such as Los Vilos and Papudo.\r\n\r\nVast flocks of divers, gulls, and pelicans indicated the\r\nabundance of fish, of which shoals now and then flecked the\r\nsurface, tormented by porpoises and swordfish. \"It's a\r\nderned place for sharks too,\" said an American; \"but\r\nI never heard of them eating any humans.\" At intervals\r\nprecipitous ridges of rock rise from the sea\r\nappearing as if they were heads crested with masses of\r\nwhite hair--these are inchoate attempts of the sea birds\r\nto establish guano beds, and they are carefully watched by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nOne of our passengers, Dr. Tyndall, who was appointed\r\nto H.M. storeship at Coquimbo, had been wrecked in the",
  "p1300.png": "Cotopaxi, and his account supported the theory of Colonel\r\nNorth that the vessel had not struck upon a rock, but that\r\nwhen she \"opened out\" the plates with which her rents\r\nhad been patched after the collision with a German\r\nsteamer previously, gave way.[*] Dr. Tyndall said he was\r\nleaving the saloon with the purser when he heard cries and\r\nsaw smoke and steam issuing from the hatchways on deck.\r\nImmediately afterwards there was a slight explosion and a\r\nrush of steam, which showed that the sea water was putting\r\nout the fires. The conduct of the Captain was admirable,\r\nand he was well seconded by his officers. In eight minutes\r\nevery soul on board--men, women, and children--were in\r\nthe boats escaping from the sinking steamer, which disappeared\r\nbodily in a few seconds after the Captain left her.\r\nThey were rescued after several days' severe privation on\r\nthe desolate shores of the Straits by a German steamer,\r\nwithout the loss of a single life.\r\n\r\nMay 2nd.--It was night when the Serena reached the\r\nport of Coquimbo. Presently the shore boats clustered\r\nalongside. There came from one a hail in English, \"Have\r\nyou got a passenger named Dr. Tyndall, of H.M.S. Liffey,\r\non board?\" \"Ay! ay! here I am all right!\" \"We\r\nhave come from the ship to take you off! Have you\r\ngot much baggage, sir?\" \"Confound them,\" said the\r\nDoctor, \"what a question! the fellows must know I have\r\nlost everything! They are making fun of me!\" And, in\r\nfact, the Doctor was saved with the clothes on his back\r\nonly, and had to get a temporary refit and rig-out at\r\nValparaiso for this voyage to his ship.\r\n\r\nMay 3rd.--The doctor bade us good-bye this morning\r\n\r\n* It was subsequently ascertained, however, that there was a rock in situ;\r\none of the German steamers found and determined its position, close to the\r\nscene of the catastrophe.",
  "p1310.png": "and went on board H.M.S. Liffey, the supply ship for the\r\nBritish Pacific Squadron and station, to which he was\r\nappointed from the flagship at Queenstown.\r\n\r\nMost of the party landed early and paid a visit in the\r\nforenoon to the vice-consulate, where we were hospitably\r\nentertained, and where we read the papers and telegrams\r\nand learned the latest news, whilst the posting resources\r\nof the town were being called into activity to furnish\r\ncarriages for an excursion to Serena.\r\n\r\nThere are between 5,000 and 6,000 people in Coquimbo,\r\namong them French, German, Spanish, and Italian, and\r\nthe English names of Edwards, Grierson, Lloyd, Steele,\r\nSpencer, Stephens, James, Raby, &c., denote the presence\r\nin the town of the Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nThe number of insurance companies is remarkable.\r\nI counted the South British, London Imperial, London\r\nCorporation, Lancashire, Queen, Commercial, Union,\r\nNorthern, the Chilian Valparaiso Company, &c. There are\r\nseveral banks, two lines of telegraph. There is a large\r\nstaff of officials, a civil governor, a commandant, a judge\r\nof the first instance, a marine governor, a commandant of the\r\ntroops, an administrator of customs, and a postmaster, &c.\r\n\r\nThe \"Coquimbinos,\" as a friend of mine called the\r\nnatives, judging from their praise of the air and even of\r\nthe scenery, are very well content with their town. The\r\nadvantages of the port in comparison with most of the sea\r\ntowns on the coast are considerable. There was an active\r\ntrade here, copper, silver, cobalt, coal, and manganese; but,\r\nowing chiefly to the copper crash, it is at present diminished.\r\nThe great foundries and smelting works are silent, the\r\nchimneys of most of the factories are smokeless.\r\n\r\nCoquimbo has all the apparatus of civilisation and of\r\ngovernment, with such luxuries as the electric light and",
  "p1320.png": "telegraph, the telephone, and a railway. A canal fed by\r\nthe river which trickles into the sea by many devious\r\nchannels, provides the town with drinking water, and serves\r\nto irrigate the patches of garden around it. I should have\r\nthought Coquimbo rather a dismal place, but it appears\r\nthat it is not considered at all bad--that is, by comparison.\r\nThere is a good climate; there is some sport to be had and\r\neven a little society, and as it is a port of call, the bay is\r\nenlivened by the steamers and by the men-of-war which\r\nhave a fancy to look in from time to time.\r\n\r\nWe had to wait some time till the tide was sufficiently\r\nlow to allow us to drive out by the sands to the ancient city\r\nof Serena. At high water the ground close to the shore is\r\nswampy, and carriages cannot cross the river. Close to the\r\nsea, the sand is hard and smooth and the horses, accustomed\r\nto the roar of the surf, do not fear an occasional\r\nsweep of a breaker up to their knees. It was a novel and\r\nvery interesting excursion--on one side the beach and the\r\nAndes--on the other the deep sea. The coast is dotted by\r\nold batteries and earthworks, constructed during the war\r\nto prevent the Peruvians landing, in some of which small\r\nguns are slowly rusting away, but a much more effectual\r\nprotection is permanently afforded by the surf and shoals.\r\n\r\nOur carriage halted at a restaurant near the railway\r\nstation outside the town, and after a brief delay for refreshments,\r\nwe set out to see Serena. We made an excursion\r\nthrough the principal streets in a tramcar under the control\r\nof a very pretty young lady. The employment of women\r\nas conductors is universal, and as far as I know it is free\r\nfrom inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt is not owing to the good offices of our countrymen that\r\nSerena exists. Spanish historians record that the \"English\r\ncorsair,\" Francisco Drake, made an attempt on the",
  "p1330.png": "place in December, 1578, and that Richard Hawkins sought\r\nto take it in May, 1594, but that they both \"desisted in\r\nface of the resistance offered to them by the inhabitants.\"\r\nThe \"pirate, Bartholomew Sharp,\" was more successful,\r\nfor he entered the town in September, 1680, and after he\r\nhad sacked all the treasure in the place, burned it. Edward\r\nDavis, the buccaneer, made an unsuccessful attempt in 1686\r\nto repeat the exploit of his piratical friend. But the forces\r\nof nature were more formidable than corsair or buccaneer,\r\nand the earthquake of 8th of July, 1730, destroyed\r\nthe greater part of the town. However, the natural advantages\r\nwhich commended the site to Valdivia, one of\r\nthe greatest of Spanish governors and conquerors, enabled\r\nit to maintain its position, and if somewhat sombre and\r\ndull, it presents to-day the appearance of a well-ordered\r\ntown. Serena is built in the usual Spanish fashion in\r\nrectangular blocks, one hundred and twelve yards square,\r\nand is gifted with well-paved streets, an alameda, a plaza\r\nand boulevards lined with trees.\r\n\r\nWe were introduced to the Club, and presently a number\r\nof gentlemen, anxious to do the honours of their city, came\r\nthere to welcome us, and were profuse in expressions of\r\ndesire to be of service[**.] We had, however, to return before\r\ndark, and so we took the train back to Coquimbo. When\r\nwe got back to the Serena we found there was an addition\r\nto our passengers between decks and a considerable\r\ndiminution of the stores. A fog came on soon after we left\r\nCoquimbo, and our speed was reduced at night.\r\n\r\nMay 4th.--At seven A.M. anchored in the roads off\r\nHuasco. The Pacific rushing on the reefs and on the\r\nshore, where two small piers marked the landing-place,\r\nsandhills in front, sandhills on the flanks, sandhills in rear,\r\nthe Andes and clouds behind. A little heap of houses",
  "p1340.png": "huddled together in the midst of some large buildings,\r\nfurnished with tall chimneys, now smokeless. Why\r\nBartholomew Sharp and Davis harassed the place two\r\nhundred years ago it would not be easy now to determine,\r\nunless Huasco has been greatly changed, or that they were\r\nvery fond of fruit. The country around this arid spot is\r\nnoted for its fertility. Excellent wine of a generous\r\nquality is produced in the valleys, and the raisins are\r\nconsidered by the natives equal to those of Malaga. There\r\nare mines of gold, silver, copper, and cobalt in the hills, and\r\nthe plains yield rich crops of every description of grain.\r\n\r\nWeighed again at eleven A.M. Observed at sea curious\r\npatches some miles in length, irregular in form, but generally\r\nin narrow strips as white as snow, seemingly of a creamy or\r\na buttery character, floating on the surface, probably foam\r\noff the rocks on the coast collected under conditions of\r\natmosphere which, as far as I know, do not exist elsewhere--at\r\nleast, I have never seen a similar appearance.\r\n\r\nA short run along the coast brought us next to Carrizal\r\n(Bajo), a port not too commodious or safe, to judge from\r\nappearance. In the good times that have disappeared,\r\nbefore the operations of the copper syndicate, Carrizal had\r\nconsiderable trade. The moles and quays are now deserted;\r\nthe furnaces are blown out; the export of ores which\r\ntwo or three years ago amounted to more than two millions\r\nof kilos, has fallen one half, and the two lines of\r\nrailway have but little to carry or take for Carrizal. But\r\nfor one of the party this little place possessed an absorbing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn a building which he pointed out to us from the\r\ndeck was the workshop in which Colonel North was first\r\nemployed after his arrival in the pursuit of the fortune\r\nwhich he finally captured on the coast, and scarcely had",
  "p1350.png": "the anchor reached the bottom ere he hastened to visit\r\nthe scene of his early labours. He led his friends to the\r\ndeserted workshop. \"There is the bench at which I\r\nworked! There is the place where I kept my tools!\r\nHere day after day for many a month I worked as an engineer\r\nat four dollars a day!\" I believe there was a fellow\r\nworkman whom he recognised at the place. A rencontre\r\nof that kind, you may be sure, is generally to the great\r\nadvantage of one of the parties. There is not a town along\r\nthis coast which has not some point of interest or some\r\nreminiscence for Colonel North, but I think he had more\r\npleasure in his visit to Carrizal than he found in any of the\r\nother places we touched at. Apart from such associations\r\nand from ties of business, property or family, there are generally\r\nfew more dreary and uninviting localities in the world\r\nthan the little ports on the Pacific coast of South America.\r\n\r\nMay 5th.--At eight A.M. the Serena anchored in the\r\nPuerto Mayor of Caldera, two hundred and eight Spanish\r\nmiles (millas) from Valparaiso. Landing at the moles to-day\r\nwas not easy. Although there is a lighthouse on a little\r\nhill at the point, a skipper would do well to wait for day\r\nbefore he ran in to take up his moorings. The town is\r\npurely commercial, and its prosperity depends on the mines\r\nnear at hand. There are the usual factory chimneys,\r\ntowering above the low houses of wood disposed in\r\nstreets ankle-deep in sand, at right angles, with the\r\nuniversal background of sandhill and brick-coloured\r\nmountain. Close to the quay are rows of guns of great\r\nsize and small power, Columbiads, Rodmans, the spoils of\r\nthe arsenals of Lima. Why they were brought so far\r\nand why they were left at Caldera, I could not find out.\r\nThere is a lighthouse and there is a railway--the first of\r\nany importance constructed in South America--to Copiapo,",
  "p1360.png": "Pabellon, &c. There are telegraphic lines and a submarine\r\ncable. In fact, there are few towns of 3,500 people in\r\nEurope so well provided with everything, except water,\r\nfor which the people have to depend upon the condensers\r\nof the railway, which produce 27,000 litres a day. The\r\ncountry around is exceedingly arid. One attraction Caldera\r\npossesses, but it is only when there is a perfect calm\r\nat a certain time of the year--August or September--and\r\nthen there are frequent displays of the fata morgana of\r\nunusual beauty. A southerly wind with a point or two west\r\nin it brings in a heavy roll. The surf beats heavily on\r\nthe rocks. Remained here till half-past two in the afternoon.\r\nOur vegetables were in great demand, and it was\r\nwith difficulty the ship's officers could get the purchasers\r\ninto their boats as the screw was turning ahead.\r\n\r\nMonday 6th.--We had rather an unpleasant experience\r\nlast night of the rolling power of the Pacific in the run\r\nfrom Caldera to Antofagasta, where the Serena, passing the\r\nports of Cha\u00f1aral, Taltal, Caleta Oliva, Paposo, and Caracoles,\r\nanchored at eight A.M. To the eye there is but little\r\nto commend Antofogasta[**P3: Antofagasta]. Nevertheless I surveyed the\r\nplace with great interest. Here arose the quarrel--a cloud\r\nnot larger than the hand of Mr. Hicks--which, charged\r\nwith the thunder of war, spread over Tarapac\u00e1, burst in\r\nstorm on Peru, and when it receded left the Chilian flag\r\nwaving all along the coast northwards up to Arica. There\r\nwas a fleet of vessels at anchor tossing and rolling uncomfortably\r\nin the long swell, and certainly I was not tempted\r\nto land by the experiences of my companions, but very\r\nmuch preferred to be tossed about in the Serena.

Even the easier landing-place\r\nwas difficult enough. So Colonel North's friends on shore,\r\nband and all, were disappointed, and that which would have\r\nbeen a collective demonstration resolved itself very pleasantly\r\nin due time into individual greetings after he had landed.\r\n\r\nImmediately on landing at the Railway Pier, we proceeded\r\nalong the branch line in a carriage drawn by a tiny\r\nengine to visit the Railway Station, and to inspect the\r\nworkshops, the Iron Foundry, and the water reservoirs,\r\nbefore we settled down in our quarter. It was difficult to\r\nbelieve that the busy scene around one was what a well-known\r\nwriter calls \"one of the unnatural abodes of men on\r\nthe shores of the Pacific,\" which has become the centre of\r\nactivity and life in the space of a few years. But it could\r\nnot have held many people till some means of supplying\r\nfresh water had been provided. There are frequent mentions\r\nof the place in old books, and the rocky island opposite the\r\ntown on which the Lighthouse stands is frequently spoken\r\nof in voyages as \"the island of Iquique.\"\r\n\r\nIquique, Pisagua, and the other ports in the rainless region\r\nof the Chilian coast and their dependent populations\r\non the pampas, extending from 19\u00b0 to 27\u00b0, are unique in\r\nthe nature of their relations to the world. They tax the\r\nresources of all parts of the earth, and in return they sell\r\nthat which enriches exhausted fields, and gives fresh life to\r\nthe worn-out agricultural lands of Europe.\r\n\r\nOut at anchor beyond the Railway Pier you see one of the\r\nthree water-ships belonging to Colonel North; vessels of",
  "p1400.png": "800 or 900 tons burthen, some of which make fourteen trips\r\na month between this and Arica and the coast, where\r\nthey take in water to supply Pisagua and Iquique. I\r\nbelieve I am not wrong in assigning to Colonel North\r\nthe credit of a clever arrangement of the water tanks\r\nby which the dangerous cargo is confined and carried with\r\nsafety. The reservoirs on shore are filled by 5-inch\r\nrubber hose from the water tanks in the ships. The Tarapac\u00e1\r\nwater business was at one time in Colonel North's\r\nhands, but he sold it some time ago for \u00a3100,000, or\r\nabout three years' purchase of the returns.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary to give particular\r\naccounts of the hospitalities and festivities which were\r\ninaugurated at Coronel, continued at Valparaiso, at Vi\u00f1a del\r\nMar, at Santiago and at Iquique, and which did not come\r\nto an end till the party left Callao for Panama on their way\r\nhome. These were pleasant at the time, and they have\r\nleft pleasant memories in the minds of those who renewed\r\nold friendships, or formed new acquaintances at the\r\nmerry meetings. But though the banquets afforded evidence\r\nthat the resources of civilization are abundant and\r\nvarious in Chile, and the balls proved that where there\r\nare light hearts, nimble feet, and plenty of partners,\r\nnothing is wanting for the enjoyment of the dance, I think\r\nmy readers will not care to read of the gaieties of people\r\nthey do not know, or to study the menus of dinners at\r\nwhich they did not assist. The entertainers and most\r\nof the guests at these reunions were Europeans, the\r\nmajority of them English, and, with the exception of\r\none very large and luxurious banquet given by Se\u00f1or\r\nMaciver, a Chilian Senator, to Colonel North and his friends\r\nat Santiago, and the entertainment of Se\u00f1or Cousi\u00f1o and\r\nSe\u00f1or Gubler at Macul, there was no marked departure",

Considering the love of the Chilians for making\r\nand hearing speeches, it is rather remarkable that they do\r\nnot indulge more largely in opportunities for the display of\r\npost-prandial eloquence.\r\n\r\nMr. Rowland and his wife received Colonel and Miss\r\nNorth, Miss Wentworth Smith, my wife and myself, and\r\ninstalled us most comfortably in their house, whither at\r\nbreakfast, lunch and dinner there flowed in an uncertain\r\ncontingent of the party, Mr. and Mrs. Spencer, Mr. Melton\r\nPrior, Captain Brough, Mr. Power, &c.

It must have been a great strain\r\non the household administration of our good hosts to\r\nprovide so large a party with accommodation and food in\r\nsuch a place as Iquique, but there were no signs of it.\r\nWell, the sea yielded fish, the corbino, the congrio and the\r\nlissa, and when it did not, there was the dried salt cod,\r\n\"bacala\" (not for me), to fall back upon; there were\r\nvegetables and fruit in abundance, delicious bread and good",

But the list is long.\r\nSuffice it to say, that there are exceptions to be highly\r\nvalued and to be thankful for, but I hope I may not\r\noffend if I say I do not think that these abound in Spanish\r\ncookery; and though a Portuguese \"boy\" can turn out eatable\r\nthings when he is far away, it appears to me that the\r\ninhabitants of the Peninsula revel to excess in Proven\u00e7al\r\ncookery, and that the Chilians inherit the tastes of their ancestors\r\nin Europe. They love their casuela, a chicken broth\r\nwith vegetables, served at breakfast, and not absent at lunch,\r\ndinner, or supper, which perhaps affords as favourable a\r\nmedium for discussing tough poultry as any other, and they\r\ngreatly affect a kind of mutton pie, only it is not always\r\nmade with mutton, and is not round, simply meat enclosed\r\nin thick paste and baked to a turn. But in roast and\r\nboiled they are primitive, and in made dishes are given to\r\nways which induce the stranger to prefer their simpler\r\nexercises in the culinary art. The mutton would not take\r\na prize in any British market, but Chilian beef is excellent,\r\nthe poultry plentiful, but worn to a thread by misery and\r\nwant of food. Turkeys, on the contrary, flourish, vegetables\r\nand fruit are excellent, the Chilian potato the best\r\nin the world, Chilian flour incomparably the sweetest I\r\nhave ever eaten.

No one is\r\nlong in Chile before he is invited to praise the kingfish,\r\nthe pescarey, which is rather like a champion gudgeon, and\r\nwhich split open and fried is not altogether tasteless, with\r\nsomething of the flavour, or want of it, that characterises\r\nthe whiting. Like our whitebait, the kingfish thrives\r\nin brackish waters, and affects shores where fresh-water\r\nstreams mingle with the ocean. The congrio, a large fish\r\nof the sea, is held in much estimation; but of the fish\r\non the coast of which I made the acquaintance at table\r\nthe best was unquestionably the lissa.

Another feature in these\r\nChilian towns, dear to the natives, which they have inherited\r\nfrom Spanish ancestors, is the Alameda, with its\r\nPlaza sacred to the fame of some local native, whose statue\r\nis often a doubtful adornment to the centre of it.

In addition\r\nto the ordinary causes of conflagrations which abound in\r\ncities built of wood, where many inflammable materials\r\nare stored, there is in nitrate of soda a certain danger of\r\ncombustion; the causes of which are not, I believe,\r\nthoroughly understood.

A light shower of rain falls only once in\r\nvery many years, the ravines are consequently covered\r\nwith detritus, and the mountain sides covered with piles of\r\nfine white sand even to a height of 1,000 feet. During\r\nJuly a heavy bank of clouds stretches over the ocean; it\r\nseldom rises above these walls of rocks on the coast. The\r\naspect of the coast is most gloomy. The little port, with\r\nits few houses, seemed overwhelmed, and out of all proportion\r\nwith the rest of the scene. The inhabitants live like\r\npersons on board of ship.

Native sailing vessels supply\r\nbarley, fodder. Foreign sailing vessels bring hither coal,\r\ncoke, spirits, wine, machinery, steel, iron, wood, and corrugated\r\niron (for building purposes), jute bags for nitrate\r\nof soda and borax, besides every description of general\r\ncargo. Abundance of coal, such as Orrell Steam, West\r\nHartley, Australian, and from Lota (South Chile), is\r\nimported in enormous quantities, and sold at moderate\r\nprices.

But there were visitors, too, who had mines to sell\r\nand various projects to recommend. One enthusiastic\r\ngentleman came to work out nothing less than a rebellion\r\nin a neighbouring state, and made an application to Colonel\r\nNorth \"to finance a revolution in Peru\" as a most legitimate\r\nand profitable employment of his spare capital.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the uncertain nature of mining speculations,\r\nthe people on the coast, natives as well as foreign, have\r\na great hankering after ventures in quest of ore, and pro-*",

Some, indeed, have\r\nmade fortunes. Others have lost them in the quest. There\r\nare rich mines near Iquique, and there are those who\r\nbelieve that even in mines long since abandoned there is\r\nabundant return to be obtained for the employment of\r\ncapital, as the Spaniards and Chilians who worked these\r\nmines were not able to reduce what they got, or to utilise\r\nthe deposits. But I think the Chilians who own good\r\nmines like to keep them. There were indeed close at\r\nhand outward and visible signs and proofs of the existence\r\nof silver in the mountain range above us. We could see\r\nand judge for ourselves of the richness of the ores of\r\nHuantajaya, Descrubadara, Constantia, Paquanta Colorado,\r\nand by visits to the \"Amalgamating\" Works at Cavancha,\r\nor to the \"Beneficiadora\" in Iquique. At the latter I not\r\nonly walked on a carpet of powdered ore spread over a\r\nlarge enclosed square, but walked down an avenue between\r\nwalls which were built up of silver bricks! These works\r\nare managed by a worthy \"Captain\" from the west\r\ncountry, long resident on this coast, where he has made\r\nmany friends and acquired, I hope, a fair fortune, for the\r\nfamily he has reared up in Chile with the help of his good\r\nEnglish wife. Although there are certain processes which\r\nare not revealed to every visitor, the amalgamation and\r\nreduction of the ores are effected, as far as I could judge,\r\nafter the methods in vogue at Leadville and Denver. The\r\nutmost care is taken to guard against the fumes of the\r\nquicksilver, and the most recent improvements are applied\r\nfor the protection of the workmen employed in the amalgamation\r\nand reduction.

They buy and sell, marry and, when the times are\r\ngood, are given in marriage, dance and sing and enjoy themselves\r\nand have their sports, games, and amusements, like\r\nother folk.\r\n\r\nI was wont to spend many an hour on my balcony,\r\nfinding never-ending interest in the scene below. In front\r\nthere is the Cricket ground, an asphalted quadrangle. Not\r\nmany yards distant from longstop's whereabouts, and\r\nwithin range of a good drive for three, if you are by my\r\nside, you may observe a mound of earth like the semi-*circular\r\ntop of one of the village ovens, in the sandy plain\r\nin which the shoe would sink ankle deep. There are\r\ngenerally two or three, sometimes more, women in black,\r\nkneeling devoutly before the mound, and if you walk over\r\nyou will see that there are lighted candles flickering in a\r\nvaulted space enclosed by adobe walls. The women are\r\nworshippers at the tomb of a saint. Who he was I never\r\ncould ascertain. Possibly I asked the wrong people.\r\nIndeed, some worthy residents of Iquique could not tell\r\nme the name of the great church in the plaza! But the\r\nstory I heard was that some years ago the body of a man",
  "p1540.png": "was found on the beach and carried to this spot and buried.\r\nLo and behold! The leg of the dead man presently popped\r\nup out of the grave! It was put under ground once more.\r\nBut it came up as before! Repeated interments could\r\nnot keep the uneasy limb in its place. So the people\r\nconcluded that the man was a saint! They erected a\r\nsemi-circular wall round the grave. And now in time of\r\ntrouble, believers repair to the shrine and pray, and votive\r\nofferings and flaming tapers attest the sincerity of their\r\nfaith, and the performance of cures effected, and wishes\r\ngratified, by the intercession of the agency of the holy\r\ncastaway. Irreverent people laugh at all this; they say\r\nthat the body was that of a drunken English sailor\r\nwho fell overboard from one of the ships in the harbour.\r\nBut they did not account for the irrepressible leg or the\r\nmiracles! For myself I thought it very touching to see\r\nthese poor worshippers kneeling and praying before their\r\nshrine, caring little for the shouts, \"Run! Run! Throw\r\nit up! Well caught!\" and the like from the cricketers\r\nand the spectators in the Cricket Clubhouse. There is a\r\ntall wooden cross near the mound marking another grave,\r\nbut no one pays any attention to it.\r\n\r\nTwo sides of the cricket ground are enclosed by shanties\r\nin which the Chilian labourers live. Above the roofs of\r\nthese rise the iron cranes of the Railway Pier, the cisterns\r\nand water tanks of the condensers, and the chimneys of the\r\nIron Foundry and of the workshops of the Railway Company.\r\nOn a steep hillock, beyond the scraggy little suburb,\r\nthere is a look-out station on a high mound, with a flagstaff\r\nand a fieldpiece, which ought, it is supposed, to be fired by\r\nsome one or other at noon. There was generally a group\r\nof soldiers near the gun about that time. Sometimes\r\nthey fired it, sometimes they did not. It seemed to me",

Occasionally the report coincided with\r\ntwelve o'clock.\r\n\r\nSeparated by a wall from the cricket ground you see\r\nthe offices, storehouses, the passenger and goods stations,\r\nthe sidings, platforms, locomotive and carriage shed, and\r\nworkshops of the Nitrate Railway--\"worthy,\" as Captain\r\nCastle says, \"of any city in Europe\"--all on a grand\r\nscale, lofty and spacious, covering many acres. Nearer\r\nto you down below is the court of the house and the\r\nwee farmyard, with a covered fountain in the midst\r\nfor the delectation of the ducks, poultry and pigeons,\r\nand goats, of which Mrs. Rowland superintends the welfare,\r\nand therein, in the tiny garden, the green of which is\r\nmost refreshing to the eye, are some bravely struggling\r\ntrees, creepers, rose-bushes and flowers. To the left are the\r\nroofs of the houses of the town, the Church of the Immaculate\r\nConception, cup and ball, pediment and dome\r\npainted in many hues--at least five distinct colours--and\r\nfarther away there are the pier and the signal tower, which\r\nindicates by flags and a ball the state of the surf, safe or\r\notherwise, and Lighthouse, the Island which protects the\r\nroadstead and the town from the sea.

They were as\r\nregular as clockwork in their rates, each train keeping its\r\nprescribed distance from the other, as if they were fixed\r\nparts of a machine. As each train passes a station the clerks\r\nin the office at Iquique are notified by the telegraph of the\r\nexact time, and the manager has under his eye, as it were,\r\nthe position of every engine and waggon on the line. The\r\nrailway can be traced stretched like a narrow black riband on\r\nthe greyish-brown mountain side from the Reversing Station\r\noutside the town some two miles away, to which the ascent\r\nis not very steep. As you look eastwards to the Andes, you\r\nsee near the skyline a faint small white cloud like the smoke\r\nof a gun. But it moves--the puffs are intermittent. Straining\r\nyour eyes you make out a dark object on the black\r\nthread. It is a locomotive descending from the Pampas,\r\ndrawing its appointed load of waggons and carriages. It\r\nseems almost stationary--but it is creeping down. As you\r\nare trying to count the trucks in the train, another jet of\r\nvapour from another black speck at the summit behind,\r\nannounces another train in the wake of that which is now\r\nvisibly gaining ground towards you. Presently a third train\r\ncomes in view.

The special train, composed of an\r\nAmerican saloon carriage, a truck for baggage, and the\r\nengine, preceded by a pilot engine, was in charge of Mr.\r\nRowland, and we felt quite safe in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe engines are necessarily powerful, for the gradients\r\nvary from 2\u00b750 to 3\u00b785 per cent., and there are curves to\r\nbe overcome of 450 feet radius. The favourite type in\r\ngeneral use is, I believe, a Fairlie of from eighty to eighty-five\r\ntons, with double boilers. The line climbs up, due east,\r\nthe steep mountain side from the terminus to the Reversing\r\nStation two miles distant. There the engine is transferred\r\nto the other end of the train, and thence strikes the line\r\nsouth to the slope of the Andes. On the left hand as you\r\nmount there is the o\u00f6lite rock of the mountain range\r\nseamed with ravines which are filled with drifted sand; to\r\nthe right there is the steep slope of the hillside, descending\r\nsheerly to the sandy strip between its base and the beach.\r\nNot more than a mile across from the base the strip of flat",
  "p1610.png": "land is bounded by the beach and the reefs and the breakers\r\nof the Pacific. As we mount the view becomes more\r\npicturesque, in the true sense that it is very like a picture.\r\nNot many minutes pass before the passengers in the train\r\nlook on the town of Iquique, which is spread out below,\r\nlike a chess-board with large squares, seemingly so near\r\nthat you make out the Alameda, the Cathedral, the Station,\r\nCavancha and the Racecourse, the Hospital, the Silver\r\nRefineries, the Gas and Water Works, the Lighthouse\r\nand Custom-house, the houses of your acquaintances,\r\nset in a framework of brown desert, with a fretwork\r\nborder of rocks on which the surf beats eternally. As\r\nthe train ascends, the lines contract, and the ships in\r\nharbour between the island and the shore are dwarfed to\r\ncock-boats.\r\n\r\nYou are now looking down on the scene of a great event\r\nin the history of the late war. For a Chilian this is classic\r\nground, and below is classic sea. Iquique, then a Peruvian\r\nport, was blockaded by the Chilian vessels Esmeralda,\r\nCaptain Prat, and Covadonga, Captain Condell, when the\r\nPeruvian ironclads Independencia and Huascar came down\r\nto raise the blockade, and on 21st May, 1879, a combat\r\nwhich ensured Arturo Prat a Chilian immortality ended\r\ngloriously, if fatally, for the blockaders. The wooden\r\ncorvette, Esmeralda, was rammed by the Huascar after a\r\nvigorous defence of four hours, and a gallant attempt to\r\ncarry the ironclad, in which Prat perished on the deck of\r\nthe enemy, and sank with 120 of the crew of 180 officers\r\nand men with which she began the action. You can see\r\nthe point (Gruesa) off which the Independencia, chasing\r\nthe little Covadonga, was lost. The Chilian steamer, to\r\nescape her formidable foe, ran inside a reef off the point\r\nclose in shore, and the Peruvian, following with more",

The anniversary of the fight is kept as a\r\nnational holiday.\r\n\r\nAbout six miles from the Reversing Station there lies, on\r\nthe right hand side of the line as you ascend, a remarkable\r\nridge of sand \"in the shape of a cornucopia,\" says one\r\neye-witness, \"with the narrow end next the slope of\r\nthe mountain, and the broad or truncated end towards\r\nIquique.\" \"It looks,\" according to another, \"like some\r\nmonstrous animal couchant, a great lion with ribs and\r\nsides and mane of sand, menacing the plain.\" Travellers\r\nhave related that this sandhill, variously estimated to be\r\n600, 800, and 1,000 feet high, is slowly moving southwards,\r\nand have prophesied woe to Iquique, but I could not find\r\nany verification of the story that the hill moves onwards\r\nyear by year. At all events the progress of the hill is\r\nslow, and it may not be sure. Once a man managed to\r\nget up to the top of the mound, and it was with great\r\ndifficulty he was rescued from the sand.\r\n\r\nAs the line mounts we cross old mule-tracks from the\r\nshore, not yet altogether abandoned, as cattle for consumption\r\nat the mines and oficinas are still driven up\r\nby the herdsmen to the plateaux above, and some of the\r\nore is sent down by these routes to the reducing works,\r\nunder the superintendence of Mr. Nichols, and to the works\r\nof the Chilian Company at Iquique. At Moll\u00e9, where\r\nthere is a small station, about 1,600 feet above the sea\r\nlevel, a d\u00e9bris of bottles, meat tins, leather, rags, and\r\nbones, on the desert near at hand, marks the site of a\r\nPeruvian encampment, and gazing on the scene around\r\nus, we can realise the nature of a campaign in such\r\na country.

There seems to have been\r\na force of several thousand men on the ground, but it is\r\npossible that some of the rubbish and refuse was contributed\r\nby railway \"navvy\" detachments or miners on\r\ntheir way to the Pampas. When the Peruvians evacuated\r\nIquique after the Battle of Dolores or San Francisco,\r\nNovember, 1879, they halted here on their way to Tarapac\u00e1,\r\nwhere the allied forces of Peru and Bolivia hoped to\r\nmake a successful stand against the Chilians. Both sides\r\nclaimed the victory at Tarapac\u00e1, but after the battle the\r\nPeruvians retreated to Arica, and their march across the\r\ndesert was one of the most trying and terrible recorded\r\nin history.\r\n\r\nAt Moll\u00e9 the line curves sharply to the eastward. A\r\nfew miles further we pass Santa Rosa, 17-1/2 miles from\r\nIquique, some 3,200 feet above sea level. Santa Rosa is\r\nnot cheerful to the eye, but in relation to the mines of\r\nsilver ore in the district, for the produce of which it\r\naffords an outlet to the refineries of Iquique, it has its\r\npast and its future. Huantajaya, in its immediate neighbourhood,\r\nis a name to conjure with among mining\r\nadventurers. Not a great way from the station lies the\r\nmining ground of one company, which has as yet made\r\nno great external show. On the sand-covered rock on\r\nthe right of the line there was a small, a very small,\r\nwigwam settlement, the inhabitants of which, some score\r\nof men and women, Chilian or Bolivian, and various skit-*",

Whatever silver ore may\r\nturn up can certainly be carried away with ease to the\r\nbeneficiadores below. Of a verity there is need of mineral\r\nwealth here to make amends for the sterility of the land\r\nin everything else.\r\n\r\nWe are on the plains--\"the pampas,\" at last--but as\r\nyet the view is limited. The sea is invisible; on the\r\nright there is the railway embankment and sandhills; on\r\nthe left a rough waste of greyish red earth, bounded by\r\na line of hills to the east. Assuredly there is nothing to\r\ncharm the eye in the scenery around us. I remember\r\nnothing like it save the bed of the Bitter Lakes at Ismailia\r\nbefore M. de Lesseps opened the flood gates and let in the\r\nsea water on the basin of salt and sand. The description of\r\nDarwin in 1835 will apply to what we gazed on to-day:--\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of the country was remarkable from\r\nbeing covered with a thick crust of common salt, and of a\r\nstratified saliferous alluvium, which seems to have been\r\ndeposited as the land slowly rose above the level of the sea.\r\nThe salt is white, very hard and compact; it occurs in\r\nwater-worn nodules projecting from the agglutinated sand,\r\nand is associated with much gypsum. The appearance of\r\nthis superficial mass very closely resembled that of a\r\ncountry after snow, before the last dirty patches are\r\nthawed. The existence of this crust of a soluble substance\r\nover the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily\r\ndry the climate must have been for a long\r\nperiod.\"",
  "p1650.png": "\r\nThe simile is excellent. The plain was exactly like a\r\nfield covered with the \"dirty patches\" of snow which are\r\nleft by a thaw in level country at home.\r\n\r\nThere was some tough engineering and navvy work\r\nfor several miles through this region, from the summit of\r\nthe first plateau.\r\n\r\nThe Central Station, 29 miles from Iquique and 3,220\r\nfeet above the sea level, is a veritable surprise. There is\r\na large station with sidings and platforms, a telegraph\r\nservice and post-office, a hotel, a restaurant, a general store--a\r\n\"merchant's,\" they would call it in the Highlands--trucks\r\nfilled with nitrate drawn up for carriage to the\r\nport, and trucks laden with jute bags and cases, in readiness\r\nto be hauled to the oficinas to which they are accredited.\r\nThere are around the station--marvellous to see in such a\r\nplace!--Norwegian frame-houses--wood and zinc with high\r\nsloping roofs--and the walls are covered with familiar\r\nnames and advertisements, which recall the old world\r\nbeyond the sea.\r\n\r\nHere is the junction of the line to Pisagua on the\r\nnorth, and of the Iquique line, which continues as a main\r\ntrunk with many branches, to the nitrate works, to the\r\nsouth. From the Central Station the oficinas of Sebastopol,\r\nPaposo, San Carlos, San Vicente, Sacramento, San Pedro,\r\nPeruana, San Fernando, Solferino, and Argentina, lying\r\nclose together, are provided with communication and transport.\r\nIt is a Nitrate Clapham Junction. The branch to the\r\nwest serves Nueva Soledad, San Juan de Gildemeister,\r\nEsmeralda, Balta, and San Lorenzo, where it halts. The\r\nbranch to the east serves San Pablo, Virginia, and turning\r\nsharply to the north, ends at St. Elena. It is from the\r\nsouthernmost part of this branch that the projected railway\r\nwill run to Lagunas.",
  "p1660.png": "\r\nWhilst our giant Fairlies were being unharnessed here,\r\nand lighter pampas engines were tackled to the train, we\r\nwalked about the station and heard the local news from\r\nthe master and the gentlemen of the nitrate oficinas, who\r\nhad come to meet Colonel North. These large stations\r\nare centres of life to the circle of nitrate fields around\r\nthem, and groups of workmen assemble to hear the news,\r\ninspect the new arrivals, and enjoy themselves after their\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nAs the train entered into the Nitrate Kingdom, the\r\nlieges assembled sought to testify their loyalty by firing\r\noff squibs and crackers, cheering and waving flags. The\r\nvisitors had an opportunity of seeing the natives in their\r\nmost festive mood. When we looked around we had\r\nreason for wondering where they lived when they were\r\nat home, and where they would go to when the train\r\nmoved off.\r\n\r\nI had a most interesting account from a fellow passenger\r\nof the manners and customs of the people, among whom\r\nhe has worked for many years, and I am obliged to say,\r\nthat with all the stamp of authority and truth on what\r\nhe told me, I was rather loth to accept the statements\r\nhe made respecting the immorality of the priesthood, if\r\nnot of to-day, of times not remote, and of the consequent\r\ndegradation of their flocks. Gallenga and others have\r\ngiven accounts of the shocking profligacy of the clergy in\r\nsome South American States, not, it seems, inapplicable\r\nto this part of Chile. The Peruvian episcopate held very\r\nloose reins, and its members were by no means strict in\r\ndiscipline or practice. The peccadilloes of the padres were\r\nmatters for village gossip and amusement. \"Non meus\r\nsermo, sed qu\u00e6 precepit Ofellius\"--my informant--a very\r\ngood fellow indeed. He left us at the Central Station,",

A geologist, naturalist, physician,\r\nphilosopher, and man of sense, his lot seems not to be cast\r\nin pleasant places, but he has accepted it patiently if not\r\ncheerfully. Lord Palmerston told the late Wingrove Cook\r\nthat if a stranger desired to be thoroughly misinformed\r\nhe would \"listen to a man who had been thirty years in\r\nthe country and spoke the language like a native.\" My\r\nfriend had these qualifications, but he was entirely trustworthy.\r\nHe did not give me leave to use his name.

His father, who fought\r\nunder Napoleon, is in his ninety-fifth year, in possession of\r\nall his faculties, and his son related some of the reminiscences\r\nof the veteran, which will, I hope, find permanent\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nContinuing our course northwards from the Central\r\nStation, we see the Pampas spreading out on either side\r\nof us like an inland sea, or the bed of one, with ochre-coloured\r\nshores, above which, on the right, rise cloud-*like\r\nAndes, with snow patches on the summits, roseate in\r\nthe rays of the declining sun. The ruins of adobe walls\r\nand chimneys around us marked the sites of abandoned\r\nnative manufactories of nitrate, but without help I could\r\nnot have guessed what they were. They mostly date from\r\nthe days when the raw material was boiled, under the old\r\nsystem, in large shallow cauldrons, one or two of which\r\nwere still to be seen lying about.\r\n\r\nI have been continually reminded of the African desert\r\nand of the western shore of the Red Sea since I visited\r\nthe pampas.\r\n\r\nThe train passed the next station, Montevideo, 36-1/2\r\nmiles from Iquique, and 3,811 feet above the sea, without\r\nstopping. This is the highest point on the railway, and",
  "p1680.png": "is therefore selected as the site of the great reservoir,\r\nwhere the water pumped by steam from the wells at Pozo\r\nAlmonte is stored for the supply of the Central Station,\r\nand stations and oficinas dependent on it, till the Tarapac\u00e1\r\nWater Works Company can complete the line of pipes\r\nfrom La Pica, 44 miles distant, in the foot-hills of the\r\nAndes.\r\n\r\nAt 2.5[**P3: 2.50 ?] P.M. the special drew up at Pozo Almonte.\r\n\r\nNow the first large oficina is in sight. The word\r\n\"oficina\" is of liberal application--it may mean the\r\ncounting house of a banker or a merchant, the bureau of\r\nan advocate, a workshop, a place of business or a manufactory.\r\nOn the pampas it signifies an establishment for\r\nthe manufacture of nitrate of soda and iodine. The\r\noutward aspect of an oficina does not contribute to the\r\nornamentation of the scene in which it is placed. In the\r\ntall chimney, in the boiler arrangements, and in the\r\nmounds of refuse outside, which afterwards we learned\r\nto speak of and to know as ripio, there is a general\r\nresemblance to gas works, with the adjuncts of a coal\r\nmine. The surface of the ground near at hand is scarred\r\nwith excavations like rifle pits.\r\n\r\nPozo Almonte, or the Well on the Hill, 3,371 feet\r\nabove the sea level we had so lately left, is provided with a\r\ncorrugated iron or zinc hotel and restaurant neatly painted\r\nand well furnished--prints on the walls and carpets on the\r\nfloors, all kinds of tinned luxuries on the shelves, a bar,\r\nmany varieties of drinks in bottles, Stein-wein in box-beutel,\r\nCabinet hook, and Chateau Lafite, and every appliance for\r\nthe reasonable requirements of civilized man, and swarms\r\nof flies. This height of 3,371 feet is nothing to speak\r\nof as an elevation compared with the heights of the Andes,\r\nnot far off; but when we think of Snowdon, Ben Nevis,",

Pozo Almonte possesses a workshop, engine and\r\ncarriage shed, ample platforms, and stores. It is the\r\npoint on which the routes and branch lines from Buen\r\nRetiro, Calacala, La Palma, Pe\u00f1a Chica, San Jos\u00e9, La\r\nSerena, Normandia, and Tegethoff converge. There is an\r\nexcellent dwelling-house for Mr. Watts, the station master,\r\nand suitable accommodation for his staff; and the dusty,\r\nhungry, and weary traveller--and I think it likely any\r\nstranger who is voyaging in these parts will be well described\r\nby these adjectives--will, I am told, find a triumph\r\nof civilisation in the shape of the before-mentioned hotel,\r\ngood rooms for living and sleeping, and abundant meals, to\r\nwhich additions can be made from the store, where foreign\r\ndelicacies, wines, liqueurs, a\u00ebrated and mineral waters,\r\npotted and preserved meats--yea, even p\u00e2t\u00e9s de foie gras\r\nand truffles of Perigord--are arrayed on the shelves, or,\r\nif he desires economy, from the market-women, by whom\r\nfruit, native pastry, chucha, and the like are sold. There is\r\nanother traffic carried on in the great collection of hovels\r\nand huts made of wood, corrugated iron and zinc, of which\r\nleast said is soonest mended.

The external aspect of the oficina was not unlike\r\nthat of a north-country coal or iron mine--tall chimneys\r\nand machinery, corrugated iron buildings, offices and\r\nhouses, the shanties of workmen, a high bank of refuse.\r\n\r\nThe Buen Retiro was established by Colonel North,\r\nin conjunction with Mr. R. Harvey, some years back,\r\nand was subsequently transferred by them to the Colorado\r\nNitrate Company.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing at the huge boilers, one of them turned\r\nout from the foundry established at Iquique, the Blake\r\ncrusher with its ceaselessly-wagging iron tongue, the 8\r\nboiling tanks, 18 feet long, 6 feet broad, and 7 feet deep;\r\nthe 28 bateas, each 24 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 3-1/2 feet\r\ndeep, steaming like so many miniature geysers, some filled\r\nwith orange-coloured or crimson caldo, and others with\r\nprecipitated nitrate, we entered the residence of the\r\nmanager. British furniture and faces, and a m\u00e9nu comprising\r\nsuch items as \"Bouch\u00e9es de roi \u00e0 la Godard,\"\r\n\"Aspic de foie gras en bellevue,\" and \"Dinde truff\u00e9e\r\naux marrons,\" went far to convince us that we were not\r\nin a very uncivilized region after all. The talk, or at any\r\nrate a great deal of it, ran on nitrate, and it was incidentally\r\nstated that the caliche here averaged 35 per cent.",
  "p1720.png": "Also that 16 cartloads of caliche, 38 quintals each, would\r\nproduce from 150 to 160 quintals of nitrate. The oficina\r\nwas giving a yield of 30,000 to 35,000 quintals a month\r\nat the date of our visit, but we were informed that it was\r\nequal to turning out double this amount. After luncheon\r\nwe passed through the pulperia, where mercery, haberdashery,\r\ngrocery, and greengrocery, to say nothing of wines,\r\nbeer and spirits, are sold to the workpeople on what would\r\nbe bitterly denounced in England as the truck system, and\r\nwe also glanced at the iodine house.\r\n\r\nHaving had our first lesson in nitrate making, we\r\nmounted to our places, and the train started. There is certainly\r\nno attractive feature in the outward aspect of nitrate-*making.[**no hyphen above]\r\nIt seems to be an almost invariable concomitant\r\nof manufacturing processes that the pursuit of utility should\r\nnot be accompanied by any attention to decorative art.\r\nLooking in front, you see on either side slender chimneys\r\nrising above black or dun-coloured masses of machinery,\r\nvomiting out smoke, white vapourous steam issuing from\r\nthe boilers beneath, and heaps of brown refuse, which\r\nenable an expert to judge of the extent of the output or the\r\nage of the oficina.\r\n\r\nAs the shepherd knows each sheep in his flock, and can\r\ndetect differences between each invisible to the eye of a\r\nstranger, so the intelligent gentlemen who have brought\r\nto perfection this strange industry on the Pampas can\r\npick out nitrate works, and show how one varies from\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nPassing on the way, Calacala, La Palma, Pe\u00f1a Chica,\r\nSan Jos\u00e9, Pe\u00f1a Grande, on the left or western side of the\r\nline, and most of them with short sidings, we continued our\r\njourney ten miles on to San Donato, where we descended\r\nto inspect the oficina.",
  "p1730.png": "\r\nThe San Donato Company own 147 estacas, and the\r\npatches of caliche which are now being worked yield\r\nabout 45 per cent. of nitrate. At present about 30\r\nestacas are under exploitation, the rest being untouched\r\nground. Some 32,000 or 33,000 quintals of nitrate are\r\nproduced every month, but it is expected that there will\r\nbe a large increase when the new manufactory is built and\r\nimproved machinery erected. At present there are three\r\nboilers 24 feet by 7 feet, one Blake crusher, seven boiling\r\ntanks, 28 feet long, 6 feet broad, and 6-1/2 feet deep, and\r\nfifty-three buteas, 15 feet square, with a good slope. Here,\r\nas at most of the oficinas in this district, there is an iodine\r\nhouse, of the operations in which I shall have a word to\r\nsay presently.\r\n\r\nHaving inspected the buildings, looked at the crushers\r\nworking, the caliche boiling, the mounds of nitrate stored\r\nup on the canchas at the base of the bateas, and the bags\r\nawaiting transport, we resumed our journey and after\r\nanother short run halted at the Ramirez oficina, belonging\r\nto the Liverpool Nitrate Company. The works appeared\r\nto be very extensive and complete. A great collection of\r\nboilers, tanks, engines, two chimneys rising in the midst,\r\nworkmen's huts and the residences of the staff, the pulperia\r\nor shop--of which a similar establishment is attached to\r\nevery oficina on the Pampas. The maquina is intended to\r\nwork an area of 300 estacas; it possesses six boilers, four\r\ncrushers, ten boiling and sixty precipitating tanks, and can\r\nturn out 140,000 quintals of nitrate a month. Six square\r\nmiles of nitrate ground, said to be exceedingly rich, are\r\nowned by the company. On the branch railway a long\r\ntrain of waggons loaded up with nitrate bags for the port\r\nwas awaiting haulage, and the explosions of the tiros near\r\nat hand indicated great activity of working power.",
  "p1740.png": "\r\nFrom Ramirez the engine travelled slowly and cautiously\r\nonward. As the sun set, fiery flashes pierced the darkness,\r\nfollowed by heavy thuds, as if of some cannonade, and when\r\nit became quite dark it needed no great stretch of fancy to\r\nimagine that one was looking at a bombardment of some\r\ntown from the sea. These outbursts were the firings of\r\nthe mines. The towers of the oficinas shot rays of electric\r\nlight through the waste, and as the train passed them,\r\nwe heard the heavy thumping of the machinery crushing\r\ncaliche. And so we went by Constancia, Santa Rosa,\r\nRosario di Huara, San Jorge, Tres Marias. Then there\r\nwas a run of five miles to a junction where were many\r\ntrucks piled up with nitrate. Thence our little train\r\nturned down a siding or branch line, and presently\r\nstopped at the platform of a large station.

At the well-furnished pulperia or store\r\nthey can get necessaries of every description--clothes,\r\nprovisions, wines, and spirits, and there is generally a supplementary\r\nmarket outside the station, in which itinerant\r\nbasket-men and women sell vegetables, cakes, fruit, &c.\r\nNext the village are the stables or corrals for the mules\r\nand horses, and then there is a wide expanse of caliche\r\nbeds all around the oficina up to the rounded hills of\r\nmoderate elevation which enclose the banks of the desiccated\r\nlagoon, where the nitrate lies under the \"crust.\"\r\n\r\nThe administrator of the oficina, Mr. Humberstone, lives\r\nwith his staff around him, engaged in his campaign against\r\ncaliche without respite.

In less than half an hour, driving\r\nacross country to the westward, we came to the scene of\r\noperations, or rather to one of them. The vicinity of this\r\ntiro was marked by pits, around the edges of which were\r\nmasses of earth in wall-like mounds. This accumulation was\r\nformed by the broken costra, and all that remained of the\r\ncaliche bed were excavations resembling upon a small scale\r\nthe craters of volcanoes; these pits were worked-out mines.\r\n\r\nThe technical words used in describing the section of a\r\nnitrate mine are--chuca, the outer covering, the surface of\r\nthe ground, generally friable, varying in thickness, sometimes\r\nscarcely existent; the costra, or bed of harder earth\r\nbeneath the chuca, resting on the caliche; then the caliche\r\nitself, which varies from a few inches to 10ft. or 12ft. in\r\nthickness; then, under the rock-like mass of the nitrate\r\nbed, the soft stratum of earth or sand called cova.\r\n\r\nWe approached a group of men engaged in breaking up\r\nthe caliche and separating it from the costra. The hole\r\ninto which we peered was about 7ft. deep, and for about 15ft.\r\non either side of it the earth was heaved up and cracked in\r\ndeep fissures by an explosion of the mine fired the night\r\nbefore. Around us were also the great blocks of costra and\r\ncaliche not yet separated, which had been blown up.

As in all strata\r\nformed as caliche is supposed to be, there is great difference\r\nin the thickness of the seams, so in the nitrate grounds\r\nthe strata of the caliche, of the covering of it, and of the\r\nmatter on which it rests, differ materially in depth; the\r\ncostra may be an inch or several feet thick, the cova or\r\nearth underlying the caliche may be reached by the barreteros\r\nvery readily, or they may spend weary hours in\r\nthe tiro in driving the \"jumper\" through costra and caliche\r\nbefore they arrive at the cova where the powder is to\r\nbe placed for the mine. When the hole has been made to\r\nthe cova it is enlarged by means of a gigantic spoon till it\r\nis sufficiently wide to let down a little boy, the powder-monkey,\r\nor, as he is called, the destazdor, whose business\r\nit is to scrape away the soft earth under the caliche till\r\nhe has hollowed out the taza or cup for the charge of\r\npowder for the breaking up of the bed.

In adjusting the strength of the charge considerable\r\nknowledge, to be gained only by experience, is required;\r\nthe object being--not to produce a volcanic eruption--but\r\nto disintegrate the ground thoroughly, so as to split it in\r\nevery direction, and enable the particular, or man in charge\r\nof the working party, to judge whether it is worth while\r\nto clean the caliche and load it on the carts for the factory.",

The crushers are placed a few feet below the\r\nridge, or incline, up which the carts are drawn. The\r\ncaliche is thrown into them by the acendradores, by whom\r\nit is delivered over to the carreros to be placed in the\r\nboiling tanks by hand or by mechanical appliances. The\r\ncrushers are insatiable. Worked by steam they munch\r\ntheir caliche all day and night, and disgorge it in coarse-grained\r\npowder into the cars on the tramway, which discharge\r\ntheir contents into the cachuros or boiling tanks. In\r\nsome maquinas the iron cars or tanks travel upon a railway\r\nraised over the cachuro with the ground caliche. The\r\nbottom of the cart or tank opens on hinges, and the contents\r\nfall into the boiling tanks. In these tanks commences\r\nthe chemical change undergone by the caliche, of\r\nwhich some account will be found further on.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the tiro we found some of our equestrian\r\nfriends and Mr. Humberstone already there, examining\r\nthe caliche of the recently exploded mine. There were\r\nmasses of the stuff lying about which might easily be\r\nmistaken for fragments of marble. The workmen, muscular\r\nfellows lightly clad, were chiselling away the costra from\r\nthe caliche, splitting up the blocks which sometimes offered\r\nsuch resistance to the sledge that it is necessary to break\r\nthem up with gunpowder. How they stood the smother\r\nand heat, in air filled with saline particles, and with a fine\r\ndust which settled down like a second skin in a few minutes\r\non clothes, face and hands, was a marvel. But habit has\r\nmade these men capable of enduring such and greater\r\ndiscomforts--\"though,\" said one of the staff, \"they do\r\ntake good long drinks when they get a chance and when",

There is, occasionally, uneasiness\r\ncreated in a household because a case of provisions has\r\ngone astray, or some consignment of luxuries has failed to\r\nreach its destination, but on the whole all that is necessary\r\nfor civilised people is forthcoming in the cuisine. The\r\nbread is delicious, the potatoes are not to be excelled\r\nanywhere, the beef is particularly good. The poultry is\r\n\"of the Pampas\"--teal, duck, lapwing, and Chilian partridge,\r\nnot unlike the Himalayan kaleege, frequently\r\nappear on the table, but the menu is invariably headed by\r\n\"casuela\"--a soup of meat, fowl, and vegetables.

Machinery\r\ncannot be described clearly by words, and needs elucidation\r\nby engravings and diagrams, which would be suited\r\nto a treatise on nitrate-making, but which would be out\r\nof place here.",
  "p1890.png": "\r\nI not only do not pretend to understand generally the\r\ndetails of manufacturing processes at first sight--I go\r\nfurther and say that where those around me are refulgent\r\nwith light, it requires a long time to give me an insight of\r\nan engineering interior. I have a shrewd suspicion that most\r\npeople--and \"most people\" after all, by votes, plebiscites,\r\nor sheer numerical totals, rule the world--are as\r\nignorant as myself in such matters--very like the Pasha in\r\nEothen who had a general idea that machinery works--whizz!\r\nwhizz!--by wheels. The impostors, male and female--and,\r\nungallant as it is, I am obliged in the interests of\r\ntruth (alas! she gives little interest in return!) to say\r\nthat I think there are more of the latter than of the former\r\nin any given crowd who go round machinery galleries in\r\nexhibitions, and listen with rapt attention to explanations\r\nof the processes, and that those who do not understand\r\nbear to the intelligent minority--the inquiring and recipient\r\ncognoscenti who comprehend thoroughly--a proportion which\r\nis probably that in other things of the multitude to the\r\nman of sense.\r\n\r\nIn the work done in the oficina, however, there was no\r\nmystery, no difficulty that could not be mastered by ordinary\r\nexamination and inquiry in a day. There are, as the\r\nmap will show, a great many oficinas on the plateau of\r\nTamarugal. They vary in importance--that is, in the extent\r\nof the ground belonging to each, the value of the output, the\r\nconstruction of the works, and of the engines and machinery,\r\nbut the modus operandi in the manufacture of Nitrate of\r\nSoda is uniform. It may be described as a simple chemical\r\nprocess, depending on the relative points of saturation of\r\nwater by common salt and Nitrate of Soda. Chloride of\r\nSodium (common salt) and Nitrate of Soda are taken up--that\r\nis, they are almost equally soluble--in cold water.",
  "p1900.png": "The deposits of caliche, whether formed by the evaporation\r\nof sea water, by the decomposition of vegetable matter in\r\nthe beds of lagoons, or by other natural processes expounded\r\nby various philosophers, contain common salt as\r\nwell as Nitrate of Soda. If a saturated solution of common\r\nsalt be heated the solution will not take up much more\r\nsalt than it held before. But if a solution of Chloride of\r\nSodium (common salt) and of Nitrate of Soda be heated, the\r\nsolution will not reach its point of saturation as regards\r\nNitrate of Soda, till the water has taken up three times as\r\nmuch of the Nitrate as it dissolved before it was heated,\r\nwhilst there is only a slight increase in the quantity of\r\ncommon salt taken up in the solution. On this \"differentiation\"--to\r\nuse the pet word of Professor Smelfungus--rests\r\nthe Nitrate of Soda Kingdom. A saturated solution of common\r\nsalt and Nitrate of Soda with a specific gravity of 84\u00b0,\r\ncalled agua vieja, or \"old water,\" or \"mother water,\" is let\r\ninto a tank filled with pounded and broken up caliche. There\r\nit is heated by steam passing through coils of piping, as in\r\na distilling apparatus. The solution, as it is heated, takes\r\nup the Nitrate of Sodium, leaving the Chloride of Sodium\r\nin the caliche nearly unmolested. Then it is let off at the\r\nbottom of that tank into another, which is also filled with\r\ncaliche. There it is boiled up and acquires greater density.\r\nThe process is repeated in one tank after another down to\r\nthe last of the series, till the liquor has acquired a specific\r\ngravity of 110\u00b0, and will take up no more Nitrate of Soda.\r\nIt is then called caldo.\r\n\r\nThe caldo is carried from the boiling tanks by open iron\r\nchannels or gutters which conduct it to the settling tanks\r\nor to the precipitating tanks, bateas, where it deposits its\r\nsalts. When it is considered not quite clean or pure enough\r\nfor the bateas or precipitating pans, the caldo is run into",
  "p1910.png": "settling tanks by boys acting under an expert. The bateas,\r\n18 ft. square, 3 ft. 3 in. deep at one side, and 2 ft. 9 in. at\r\nthe other, are placed on an elevated scaffolding to facilitate\r\nthe work of precipitating the Nitrate to the drying floor\r\nbelow. The precipitating process commences as soon as\r\nthe caldo begins to lose its temperature; it goes on for\r\nthree or four days, and then the caldo, having cooled down\r\nand dropped its charge of Nitrate equitable, becomes agua\r\nvieja once more.\r\n\r\nWhen all the Nitrate has thus been precipitated the agua\r\nvieja is run off into a reservoir, from which it is pumped up\r\ninto another receiver placed at a higher level than the\r\ntanks. The arrolodores then break up the Nitrate of Soda\r\nin the bateas, and the canchadores empty it out on the\r\ncancha below to dry in the sun. This drying is often done\r\nso effectually that the nitrate hardens again, and then it\r\nmust be broken up by the retiradores, for the llenedores, who\r\nput it in bags to be taken by the cargadores to the railway\r\ntrucks. Then the conflict waged between the Nitrate producers\r\nand the Railway Company recommences, or indeed\r\ncontinues. It has been going on for years, and for very\r\nobvious reasons. The Nitrate Railway Company, in virtue\r\nof its concessions, has or had the monopoly of transport, the\r\nexclusive right to carry merchandise on the Pampas. The\r\noficinas desire naturally that the Nitrate should be carried\r\nat the smallest cost, and as the Government has a material\r\ninterest in the export, regardless of the cost of production,\r\nseeing that more than the third of all the revenue of Chile\r\nis derived from the duty levied on Nitrate at the ports,\r\nthe pressure on the railway authorities is rather severe\r\nfrom both sides.\r\n\r\nBy the time we got back to the house the sun had set\r\nin a golden haze over the low ridge of hill which bounded",

The rays of the electric\r\nlights of the oficinas were piercing the gathering darkness,\r\nwhich seemed to roll down from the Andes on the plain--fiery\r\nflashes, followed by dull reports, sounded through the\r\ngathering night from the exploding tiros--the fires of the\r\nmaquinas glowed on the Pampas around--in the deep vault\r\nof heaven above the stars shone and glowed in the sky,\r\nwith the brilliancy which the air of the desert seems to\r\ngive to their glory--the notes of a piano came through the\r\nopen window of the drawing-room, which was lighted up\r\nas bright as day--from the workmen's quarters the sounds\r\nof a guitar and a chorus were borne on the night wind.\r\nWhat was a lifeless waste when the century opened\r\nwas now a centre of enterprise, capital, science, and\r\ncivilisation!\r\n\r\nThe administrator of the oficina is a magistrate vested\r\nwith large powers in his little kingdom.

We had a long and\r\ninteresting ride and drive from Primitiva to the oficina, and\r\nwere enabled to form a good idea of the nature of the\r\ncountry, which is broken up by rolling-ground, ridges and\r\nsand-hills, with cups or lake-beds in the depressions, in\r\nwhich were the remains of old \"paradas\" or native nitrate\r\nworks. There were several oficinas in full work on the\r\nway, all of which, except one--the Aurora, I think--lay\r\nout of the direct route between Primitiva and Santa Agua.\r\nOn the way to Santa Agua there are the remains of a\r\nnitrate village, called Germania, to which some recent\r\nhistorical interest is attached on account of its having\r\nbeen the scene of a combat, or more properly speaking,\r\nof a skirmish, between the Chilians and the Peruvians\r\nafter the capture of Pisagua. Passing over such a country\r\nwithout a drop of water, either running or stagnant, in\r\nview, or a sight of a leaf or a blade of grass, burning",
  "p1960.png": "sand below and blazing sun above, I could realise in some\r\nmeasure the sufferings of the Chilians and of the allies,\r\nwho either marched triumphant or fled in defeat in one of\r\nthe most trying campaigns, I should think, which soldiers\r\never underwent. The retreat from Iquique and Pisagua,\r\nand the flight of the Peruvians and Bolivians after the\r\nBattle of Dolores, the forced march of the Chilians and the\r\npursuit of the enemy after the action of Tacna, called for\r\nan endurance and a patience which perhaps would not\r\nhave been found in troops not to the manner born, unless\r\nunder the pressure of supreme necessities. It is not wonderful\r\nthat the Peruvians--of a race more mixed and of inferior\r\nphysique--and the Bolivians--hardy mountaineers as\r\nsome of them were--should have exhibited less persistency\r\nand endurance than the Chilians, who boast that they are\r\nthe descendants of the hardy races of the Northern provinces\r\nof Spain, and assert that they have but little infusion\r\nof the Indian in their veins, though surely an admixture of\r\nthe blood of the Auracanian race would be no injury to\r\nthe best of their population. The Huaso, a rude Centaur,\r\nwould prove, one would think, to be but a bad marcher;\r\nbut the Chilians, whether Huasos or Guachos, exhibited in\r\nthe field the qualities of excellent infantry, and appear,\r\nas far as results can be trusted as an index, to have\r\nproduced cavalry far superior to the mounted men of the\r\nPeruvian and Bolivian enemy. However, this is a digression.\r\nThe tide of war that rolled over these deserts has\r\nleft little trace behind it. I fancy the sympathies of the\r\nNitrate people generally lean towards the losing side.\r\nThey had, in fact, experienced fair treatment from the\r\nPeruvian Government, and they were handed over, after\r\nthe annexation, to a vigorous administration, which had\r\na longer and stronger arm and greater national wants to",

The Administrator\r\nof the works, Mr. Whitelegg, is a man of capacity\r\nand originality. Mr. Humberstone, though he modestly\r\ndisclaimed any merit for the adaptation, introduced what\r\nis called the Siphon system when he was chemist here, to\r\nconvey the agua vieja from tank to tank. The maquina is\r\nto be reconstructed, if it be not so already; and although\r\nthe oficina has been working for some time, and has been\r\nproducing 150,000 quintals a month, the calicheras are so\r\nextensive and the ley so good that there is every reason for\r\nthe company to expect a good return for their outlay.\r\nNear the residences of the Administrator, his family and\r\nstaff, there is a town of huts--\"a thing of shreds and\r\npatches\"--where the workmen and the population on the\r\nestate are housed, and children, dogs, flies, and pigeons\r\nswarm around. The corral has accommodation for 800\r\nmules, and there is room, moreover, for horses, cattle, pigs,\r\nsheep, rabbits, and poultry.

Captain\r\nCastle says:--\r\n\r\n\"The incline is divided into three stages. It consists of\r\ntwo lines of rails, on which the ascending and descending\r\ncars travel. On a platform at the top of each incline is fixed\r\na revolving wheel, round which a single part of 2-3/4-in. wire\r\nrope travels; the bight of which lies between teeth, which\r\nopen and close alternately, holding and freeing the rope, so\r\nthat should the rope break during the ascent or descent\r\nof a car, it cannot altogether fly off the wheel. A break\r\ncontrols the speed of the drum, the principle of the incline\r\nline being, that a full car of nitrate descending pulls up a\r\ncar lightly laden with coal, wood, barley, hay, &c. Twenty-five\r\ntons of water are sent up daily, to provide for the\r\nrequirements of from 300 to 400 mules and cattle that are\r\ncorralled on the Cuesta. About 200 tons of nitrate can be\r\nsent down in a working day of 8 hours; the weight of a\r\nfull car is seldom over 5-1/2 tons; the wire rope is tested to\r\nthe maximum strain of 35 tons.\r\n\r\n* It is announced, since this sheet was written, that the Chilian Government\r\nhas given a concession to the Company to make a railway to Buena Caleta.",
  "p1990.png": "\r\n\"The inclines are rather stiff: the lower one varies from\r\n45\u00b0 to 53\u00b0, the middle about 38\u00b0 to 43\u00b0, the upper a good\r\nsteady 45\u00b0. Ladies have made the ascent and descent.\r\nSome parts of the journey are disagreeable, viz., leaving the\r\nlevel for the incline, and again, when leaving the incline\r\nfor the level, also in the descent, going from 45\u00b0 to 53\u00b0;\r\nbut the most timid need not be afraid of becoming\r\ngiddy.\"\r\n\r\nOne of our party describes his experience of a trip on\r\nthe Incline as follows:--\"A kind of step was hitched on\r\nto the back of the car that was waiting for me, and on this\r\nI took my stand. The brakesman retired into his house\r\nand set the rope loose, the attendant labourer removed the\r\nblock in front of the car and pushed it forward. Another\r\nmoment and it had passed over the edge of the platform,\r\nand was going down the cliff. Switchback railways and\r\ntoboggan slides at home had in some measure prepared me\r\nfor this sort of thing, but I must confess that when I found\r\nmyself leaning forward on my stomach against the back of\r\nthe car, and taking a bird's-eye view of Caleta Buena and\r\nthe ocean beyond, I involuntarily gripped hard and sank\r\ninto an almost kneeling position. A few seconds recovered\r\nme, and I began really to enjoy the sensation of rushing\r\ndownwards through the air. On reaching the bottom of\r\nthe section the car was levelled on a turn-table shifted to\r\nright angles, run along on to a second turn-table, and\r\nagain brought parallel to its original position, in order to\r\ncommence the descent of the second slope. Down this I\r\nwent, the sound of the wire rope rattling over the roller\r\nguides placed at close intervals all along the line between\r\nthe rails being the only sound marking our progress. At\r\nthe second level the car was again shifted as before. This\r\ntook a minute or so, and it was all but dusk as we literally",

But it was nothing, as the French say, and a few\r\nmoments later I was on level ground on an open space\r\nwith a pier stretching seaward in front of me, and piled-up\r\nrocks of nitrate backed by the corrugated iron walls\r\nof bodegas rising on each side.\" \"The roadstead is a\r\ngood one, as implied by the name Caleta Buena, and\r\nthere are few days on which nitrate cannot be sent off\r\nto the ships, of which about fifty come during the year,\r\nthough as many as ten have been anchored together in the\r\nbusy season. Last year about 900,000 quintals were\r\nshipped, this being accomplished by launches numbering\r\n25 to 30, holding about fifteen tons, and making\r\nabout four trips a-day.

In 1883 the number of oficinas on the\r\nTamarugal, Iluara, and Sal de Obispo Pampas was 166, of\r\nwhich 39 were working, and 96 were held by the State;\r\nbut a comparison of the works as they were then and as\r\nthey are now would exhibit considerable changes in ownership\r\nand arrangement.",
  "p2010.png": "\r\nI was not able to visit many of the oficinas on the\r\nPampas at Tamarugal, and I am indebted to my more\r\nactive companions for particulars of one of the great manufactories,\r\nthe development of which has been attended by\r\nmarked disturbance in the affairs of the Nitrate Kingdom\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThe Rosario oficina, or, more properly speaking, the\r\nworks and grounds formerly belonging to Messrs. Gildemeister\r\n& Company, of Iquique, consisting of the maquinas\r\nof Rosario De Huara, San Juan, and Argentina, became\r\nthe property of a company with a capital of \u00a31,250,000,\r\nin April, 1889. Mr.Gildemeister took in part-payment of\r\nthe purchase money 40,000 shares. Mr.Gallagher estimated\r\nthat these maquinas would yield 30 millions of quintals of\r\nnitrate. There is a considerable percentage of iodine[*] in\r\nthe caliche. The property consists of 162 estacas, or about\r\n1,000 acres (an estaca is 200 varas square, a vara being 33\r\nEnglish inches, so that an estaca is just equal to 7-3/8 English\r\nacres). I should here state that the estate of Primitiva\r\noriginally consisted of 215 estacas. Abrack Quiroga, containing\r\n105 estacas, was subsequently added, so that the\r\nPrimitiva oficina now owns 320 estacas. Messrs. James\r\nInglis & Co., who sold it for \u00a340,000, purchased it from\r\nthe Chilian Government for 30,000 soles[*] in certificates\r\nnot very long before, a striking proof of the rise in\r\nvalue of caliche ground. My informant, who inspected\r\nRosario in July, says, he was much struck by the size\r\nand the neatness of the oficina. It may not interest\r\nshareholders at home very much to know that a manager's\r\nhouse is exceedingly comfortable; but a visitor on the\r\nPampas may well be excused for taking note of the fact,\r\nand it certainly contributes to the successful working of\r\n\r\n* As to \"Iodine\" see Appendix.\r\n\r\n* The sole is worth about 3s.",

Mr.\r\nVizetelly was particularly impressed by the extent and\r\nvariety of articles in the pulperia, by the neatness of the\r\nworkmen's houses, the airiness and order of stables, and\r\nthe accommodation for the workmen. The machinery was\r\nof the best, and amongst the improvements which were\r\nnoted was the method of boiling the caliche in covered\r\ntanks, which were fed by cars with shifting bottoms,\r\nopening over the tanks and precipitating the caliche\r\nthrough trap-doors, thus obviating the possibility of the\r\nfrightful accidents which occur from men falling into the\r\nboiling liquid, of which several instances occurred while I\r\nwas on the Pampas. Another improvement is in the saving\r\nof agua vieja, which is drained when the Nitrate is removed\r\nfrom the batea into a gutter to a sloping platform at the\r\nbase, instead of being thrown out of the bateas on the\r\ncancha. The establishment is on an enormous scale, with\r\nadmirable equipment. Mr. Vizetelly estimated the plant\r\nof Rosario as capable of turning out 200,000 quintals a\r\nmonth, which agrees with Mr. Gallagher's report. The\r\nNitrate can be carried by the branch line which runs into\r\nthe oficina in connection with the main line of the Nitrate\r\nRailway Company, freight being paid, according to the\r\nterms imposed by Government, only on a maximum distance\r\nof forty miles, and put on board vessels in the\r\nport of Iquique, sixty-six miles distant. The Nitrate\r\ncould also, in case of need, be sent to Pisagua, fifty miles\r\ndistant. The ground is well adapted for working it, and\r\nthe oficina has an abundant water supply conducted by\r\npiping, filled by powerful pumps, with suitable engines\r\nand boiler power, from two wells on the Pampas, three\r\nor four miles distant. In order to economise fuel, it was\r\nintended to put up a windmill to utilise, for pumps and",

The oficina is fitted with the\r\nelectric light.\r\n\r\nThe oficinas of San Juan and Argentina belonging to\r\nthe same Company contain 287 estacas said to be about\r\nhalf-worked. There are 270,000 tons of Nitrate in sight\r\nat Argentina, and 100,000 tons at San Juan. Iodine is unusually\r\nabundant in the caliche. There is great difference\r\nof opinion, or rather, there is much want of unanimity\r\nrespecting the cost of production, and I would rather not\r\nventure upon the field where so many experts agree to\r\ndiffer. It is obvious, that when there is a narrow margin\r\nof profit, the restriction of production bears heavily on\r\nthe manufacturer. A few centavos per quintal make the\r\ndifference between profit and loss. One authority stated\r\nthat at a certain oficina Nitrate of Soda could be placed on\r\nthe drying floor for 40 centavos, which would make $1.85\r\nthe price per quintal shipped for exportation. Another\r\nmaker declared that the figures were absurd. It would\r\nappear certainly that there is a wide range in the cost of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nRamirez, belonging to the Liverpool Nitrate Company,\r\nwhich I visited twice, was at one time the largest nitrate-*producing\r\nestablishment in Chile.

Harvey, a gentleman who served the Governments\r\nof Peru and Chile as engineer with equal credit to himself\r\nand benefit to them, and who has returned to his native\r\ncountry in the prime of life to enjoy the fruits of his\r\nability and industry. In an account, read before the\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers, of which Mr. Harvey is\r\nmember, in 1885, he described the plant.\r\n\r\n\"Six steel boilers, 30 feet long by 6 feet 6 inches, double\r\nflues, with six Galloway tubes, constructed by Messrs.

As soon as the solution,\r\nwhich has now become caldo, stands at 110\u00b0 by\r\nTwaddell's hydrometer, it is allowed to settle for a short\r\ntime and is then drawn off into the first canal, from which\r\nit runs into the crystallizing-tanks by means of other\r\ncanals.

Ramirez was set up for \u00a3110,000. It was\r\ndesigned to produce from 6,000 to 6,500 tons of nitrate\r\na month. It worked an area of 6 square miles 300 estacas,\r\nto which 212 estacas were added. The caliche is very rich\r\nin nitrate of soda and in iodine.\r\n\r\nI have given some account of the Nitrate Railway from\r\nIquique to Primitiva, and I have tried to give an idea of\r\nthe salitreras and oficinas on the way to and in the vicinity\r\nof my headquarters on the Pampas.\r\n\r\nAt Primitiva the nitrate \"divide,\" as Americans would\r\nstyle it, is determined. The nitrate of soda produced at\r\nthe great oficina, which was making 10,000 quintals daily\r\nwhen I left, is, as occasion arises, sent north to Pisagua,\r\nand west to Iquique. Before I left Primitiva for Iquique\r\nwe made an excursion with Colonel North northwards,\r\nover new ground, and started to visit the country between\r\nthe Central Station and the Jaz-Pampa. The Progreso,\r\nMercedes, Amelia, Aurora, Salvadora, Democracia, Puntunchara\r\n(London Nitrate Company), Rosario, &c., communicate\r\nwith the Negreiros Station, 5 miles beyond\r\nPrimitiva and 76-1/2 from Iquique, at which we halted\r\nfor a few minutes on our way. The factories are scattered\r\nliberally over the Pampas. I have seen nothing\r\nin any part of the world so monotonous in colour and\r\neffect as this, the area of the greatest development of",

The Black Country--the iron and coal districts\r\nabout Glasgow--the Biscayan mining fields--the Welsh\r\ncollieries--the Bog of Allen--these are gorgeously hued,\r\nbright and cheerful to the eye, compared to the Tamarugal\r\nPampas. But the latter enjoy perpetual sunshine, the\r\nfavour of heaven, which is denied to the former. The\r\noficinas, the corrugated surface of the land, the heaps of\r\nripio, and costra, the ruins of nitrate walls, the nitrate\r\nmakers' huts, the adobe walls, furnaces, pots and pans, are\r\nso like only a native can tell one property or place from\r\nanother. Carolina transports its nitrate over the hills to\r\nthe edge of the plateau over the sea, whence it is conveyed\r\nby steep zigzags to the beach, and shipped direct\r\nat Junin. At Santa Catalina, about 10 miles from Negreiros,\r\nReducto, Concep\u00e7ion, Agua de Bearnes, Cami\u00f1a,\r\nAngela, and La Patria, find carriage seawards.

Nitrate of soda loses from 2 to 4 per cent. in\r\nweight on the voyage to Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is not my fault--I hope, at least, it is not--if the\r\nmechanism of portions of the nitrate kingdom proves to\r\nbe of small interest to my readers, who wish to have\r\nparticulars of oficinas I did not see. I have been obliged\r\nto write of caliche, agua vieja, and caldo, of bateas and\r\ncanchas, because the business for which I went so far afield\r\nwas to give some account of the industry in the Pampas.\r\nThere is, in these later days, since I went out to Chile, not\r\nonly a great fall in the value of nitrate shares but a great\r\nschism among nitrate makers, and it seems to be matter of regret\r\nthat the wise policy which formerly directed the manufacturing\r\ninterest in the Pampas, of which an account will be\r\nfound in the chapter on what I term \"Nitrate Legislation,\"\r\nhas been abandoned. It would be a mistake to take a\r\ntabular statement of the quintallage, or tonnage, of oficinas\r\nas an actual index of value. An oficina in the last gasp,\r\nworking on its only estaca of caliche, may give an enormous\r\noutput ere it dies. But, as a general rule, the export\r\ntables, ranging over a certain number of years, afford a\r\nfair idea of the productive power of the nitrate oficinas.\r\nWhilst I was on the Pampas I never saw a Chilian nitrate\r\nwork. I saw the ruins of many of the native failures.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there are many Chilian oficinas, but I\r\ndo not think that any of them are in the first rank.[*] As\r\n\r\n* I was told that the Chilian maquinas altogether produced only about one-third\r\nof the nitrate of soda exported to Europe.",

It is at Valparaiso\r\nthat the trade is regulated in accordance with orders from\r\nEurope. The nitrate fleet for Iquique and Pisagua, &c.,\r\nis generally dispatched from Valparaiso, and the destination\r\nof the cargoes is determined by commissions from\r\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France,\r\n&c.

To the\r\nwestward was a low range of brown hills. Travelling\r\nacross this country was not very pleasant. One of the party\r\ncompared his sensation as he sat in his carriage to that\r\nof being driven diagonally across a freshly-ploughed field,\r\nto which another added, \"after a hard frost.\" Nor did a\r\nchange from the carriage to the saddle bring much comfort",

In the centre of one of the\r\nlarger hollows bounded by these slopes, a gleam of white\r\ncaught the eyes of the horsemen and its wide sheen marked\r\nthe position of the dried-up salt lake or lagoon, whence\r\nthe property derives its name. For miles farther than the\r\nkeenest eye could reach from the highest point of the\r\nbank or shore lay spread out before them the cream of the\r\nnitrate fields of Tarapac\u00e1.\r\n\r\nThe area of the \"Lagunas\" estate is estimated at close\r\non a thousand estacas, or something like seven thousand",
  "p2150.png": "acres. Though at least seven hours were devoted by the\r\nhorsemen to riding over the region, the extent of it\r\nwas beyond their powers of investigation, but far and\r\nnear they could see the signs universally recognised as\r\nthose of a rich nitrate-bearing country. It had, already,\r\nbeen thoroughly tested at close and regular intervals.\r\nThe party passed shaft after shaft, sunk with this intent,\r\nat intervals of a hundred yards or so over the whole of\r\nthe area on the slopes, and at each they could judge of\r\nthe richness and quantity of the caliche which lay below\r\nthe thin crust of chuca crumbling under the horses' feet.\r\nThese exploitations or tiros revealed deposits of caliche\r\nof good quality, and sometimes eight or nine feet thick.\r\nWhere some mines had been fired experimentally huge\r\nwhite masses like alabaster, varied now and then with\r\nsimilar blocks tinted with blue, regarded by some experts\r\nas the evidence of abundant iodine, were heaped up round\r\nthe hole. Passing slope after slope exploited in this\r\nmanner, the party halted at last at a house of corrugated\r\niron, intended for the manager and for the pulperia, a\r\nsmithy, a well and pump, a small condenser with furnace\r\nand chimney, and some huts of rough stones for the men--the\r\nsmall establishment which marks the site of what at\r\nsome future day will be no doubt the \"Lagunas's\" equivalent\r\nfor Primitiva. It served as a resting-place, and\r\nalso as a restaurant for the travellers, a plentiful meal\r\nhaving been prepared from provisions sent on in advance.\r\nA tall black shaft, visible from their resting place, showed\r\nwhere a maquina had once been at work in the nitrate\r\nfields of Lagunas, but the scene of its operations was a\r\nspeck in the vast area of caliche ground stretching around\r\nit. It had, nevertheless, though commercially a failure,\r\nturned out a certain quantity of nitrate, but even the thick-*",
  "p2160.png": "*ness and richness of the caliche could not counterbalance\r\nthe cost and difficulties of transport. These difficulties\r\nwill vanish with the carrying out of the contemplated railway\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nAs regards the amount of raw material on the Lagunas,\r\nexperts, who have based their opinion on a careful examination\r\nof the depth and quality revealed by the series of\r\nexploratory tiros already mentioned, estimate it as capable\r\nof supplying 200,000,000 qtals. of nitrate at the lowest.\r\nThe tracing of the railway line from the little seaport of\r\nPatillos laid bare an unbroken stratum of solid caliche.\r\nThe abundance and depth of the mineral may be further\r\nestimated by the fact, that the nitrate manufacturers of\r\nthe party could not find ground from which it would not\r\nbe absolutely necessary to clear out the nitrate of soda\r\nbefore an area of sufficient size could be obtained for the\r\nfoundation of an oficina.\r\n\r\nIt was long past nightfall before the weary visitors\r\nstraggled back to Cerro Gordo, where they passed the night.\r\nOn the following morning they set out in a north-easterly\r\ndirection for Pica, a little town built in a green oasis at\r\nthe foot of the Andes, to inspect the Waterworks established\r\nthere to supply the Nitrate Railway and the town\r\nof Iquique. At Pica a number of springs, both hot and\r\ncold, gush forth from the rocks, but, after serving to\r\nirrigate the gardens and orchards with which the town is\r\nsurrounded, the water sinks out of sight in the broad\r\nstretch of sand extending for several miles to the westward.\r\nThe Tarapac\u00e1 Waterworks have been constructed\r\nwith a view to check this waste of the precious fluid and\r\nto turn it into gold. The property in several of the most\r\nimportant springs of Pica has been acquired, and reservoirs\r\nhave been erected by the Company to receive the waters.",
  "p2170.png": "From these reservoirs one line of pipes had already been laid\r\nacross the desert to the station at Pozo Almonte, and at\r\nthe date of this visit it was supplying the bulk of the water\r\nused on the railway, whilst a second line, destined to supply\r\nIquique, was making good progress. After inspecting the\r\nwaterworks and bathing al fresco in the hot springs, the\r\nparty wound up the day with an improvised ball at the\r\nhouse of one of the residents, some of them venturing for\r\nthe first time in their lives to attempt the national dance\r\nknown as the samacuecca. The British community call\r\nthe dance--for short--\"the Quaker.\" Probably the performance,\r\ngraceful as it is, would not find favour in the eyes\r\nof the Society of Friends, for when the cavalier and the\r\nlady, who dance to the clack of castanets, the cadenced\r\nhandclapping of the spectators around them, and the twankling\r\nof the guitar, allow their \"woven paces\" and the\r\ndalliance of their kerchiefs free expression, the motif underlying\r\nthe pas de deux might appear to be decidedly carnal.\r\nThe next morning saw them again in the saddle, and\r\nanother hard day's riding brought them, shortly before\r\nsunset, to Pozo Almonte, whence the majority of the party\r\ntook train for Iquique, where we were now all assembled,\r\nand where we remained till we finally embarked for\r\nPanama on our return to Europe.",

I hope you have got a\r\ngood many shares in it? Tell me all you know about it,\r\nplease.\" Up to that moment I had not even heard the\r\nname, nor had I formed the smallest conception of the\r\nnature of the thing itself. A Nitrate Railway! What\r\ncould it mean? The only nitrate I was familiar with was\r\nthe \"villainous saltpetre,\" and so I answered according to\r\nmy knowledge, and I was regarded with an incredulous\r\nlook. \"You are just like A.! he will not tell me anything\r\neither.\" The subject being dismissed from my mind, I remained\r\nfor many months perfectly ignorant and incurious\r\nwith regard to \"the Nitrate Railway.\" It was not indeed\r\nuntil I was very near the sphere of its operations that I began\r\nto have some knowledge of the nature of the enterprise\r\nitself. When I arrived at the capital of Tarapac\u00e1, I began\r\nto understand the situation. Up on the Pampas there were",
  "p2190.png": "great industrial factories where thousands of men, women,\r\nand children were employed in making a substance for\r\nwhich there was no use on the Pampas themselves, and\r\non these Pampas there was neither water, nor vegetable\r\nnor animal life. So the Nitrate Railway which I saw\r\nclimbing up the hill at Iquique, and which ran northwards\r\nthrough the Pampas till it found its terminus in that\r\ndirection at Pisagua, was intended to supply the wants of\r\nthe population so strangely and artificially collected on\r\nthe saline deserts, and to carry all the wealth-producing\r\nresults of their labours to the sea.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend any of my readers who are in\r\nsearch of entertaining reading to continue the perusal of\r\nthe pages which relate to the finances of the Company and\r\nworking of the railway.[*] I feel I am unable to render a\r\ndescription of railway-stations, works, plant, &c., interesting,\r\nbut the artist's labours will help better than any\r\nwords of mine to give an idea of their outward form at\r\nall events.\r\n\r\nThe raison d'\u00eatre of the Nitrate Railway was the existence\r\nof the nitrate fields or Salinas of Tarapac\u00e1. I was\r\nsomewhat surprised to find that this unknown undertaking\r\nhad been a long time in the air before it was on the land.\r\nIndeed, it was a revelation to the strangers who were\r\nwithin the gates of the Nitrate Kingdom for the first time\r\nin 1889 to learn that, so far back as 1860, the Peruvian\r\nGovernment had given a concession to two Chilians or\r\nPeruvians, Jos\u00e9 Maria Costas and Frederico Pezet, to make\r\na line from Iquique to the Nitrate Pampas at La Noria.\r\nThe concessionaires forfeited their rights in 1864, because\r\nthey had not begun their work. But the Peruvian Government\r\ngranted another concession in that year to gentlemen\r\n\r\n* See Appendix.",
  "p2200.png": "named Jos\u00e9 Pickering and Manuel Orihuela, who, however,\r\nforfeited the concession four years afterwards for non-*performance\r\nof the conditions. The railway had been laid,\r\nbut it had not been worked. They also obtained a concession\r\nfor a Railway from Pisagua to Sal de Obispo, but both\r\nof them were forfeited.\r\n\r\nThe following month in the same year, 1868, the Peruvian\r\nGovernment, which seems to have been very willing\r\nand amiable in the matter of concessions, granted to the\r\nSe\u00f1ores Montero a concession for twenty-five years for the\r\nexclusive control and profits of the Railway from the time\r\nof its opening for traffic and the ownership for forty years\r\nmore, but it was to become the property of the Republic\r\nof Peru at the end of sixty-five years. It was to be\r\nfree from taxation and from all duties on the material used\r\nin making and working and maintaining it for that time.\r\nA maximum rate was fixed for the carriage of freight (1-1/2 ct.\r\nper quintal), the right to construct a pier at Iquique was\r\nthrown in, as well as a preferential right for making all\r\nsimilar works in Tarapac\u00e1. This concession was followed\r\nnext year by another to the same gentlemen for the making\r\nof the Pisagua Railway under similar conditions in all\r\nrespects as to time, taxation, construction of piers, &c.\r\nTwo years afterwards Montero Brothers were granted,\r\nunder existing concessions, the privilege of making branch\r\nlines from the district of La Noria to various points in the\r\nprovince and for the prolongation of their line to Bolivia.\r\nThe privilege was exclusive. For twenty-five years no\r\nother railway of any sort or description could be constructed\r\nfrom the coast to any nitrate grounds between the coast\r\nand the frontier. That exclusive privilege was to last for\r\ntwenty-five years, and the rights of ownership were to endure\r\nfor ninety-nine years from the date of the opening",
  "p2210.png": "of the railway. It was originally provided that the branch\r\nlines were to be finished within a year, and the line to the\r\nBolivian frontier within four; but in 1872 the term was\r\nextended for thirty months. The works were pushed on\r\nwith more activity than knowledge, and when the railway\r\nwas at last in function it would have been a very\r\nhazardous thing for an Accidental Insurance Society to\r\nhave accepted the money of passengers. If all one heard\r\nwas true, goods and passenger trains now and then came\r\nthundering down the mountain side, dashing into the sea;\r\nand experts always had revolvers, and opened fire on the\r\ndriver the moment the train ran off the line. The remains\r\nof the carriages were incremated, so to speak, as the\r\nreadiest way of getting rid of them.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1872, Messrs. Thomson, Bonar & Co. effected\r\na mortgage for the sum of \u00a31,000,000 sterling on the railway,\r\nby deed executed in favour of Weguelin & Gessler as\r\ntrustees for the bondholders, to be redeemable by half-yearly\r\ndrawings, bearing interest at seven per cent. per\r\nannum. In 1873 the Anglo-Peruvian Bank conducted\r\nanother loan of \u00a3450,000 on the security of an agreement\r\nthat a company should be formed to purchase and work the\r\nline, and in the following year a company with a capital of\r\n\u00a31,200,000 was formed, and assumed possession of the\r\nrailway. It was styled the National Nitrate Company's\r\nRailways of Peru, but it was never registered as an\r\nEnglish company; and though there were directors in\r\nLondon, the working committee was in Lima. The loan of\r\n\u00a31,000,000 was not forthcoming, and the trustees for the\r\nbondholders obtained from the London directors an order\r\nto place the railway in the possession of their representative,\r\nwhich was agreed to by the Lima Committee.\r\n\r\nMontero Brothers, objecting to the arrangements which",
  "p2220.png": "were made, commenced legal proceedings to dissolve the\r\ncompany; and were so far successful, that they obtained a\r\ndecision for the appointment of a receiver, but the lawsuit\r\nin which the Anglo-Peruvian Bank and the trustees for the\r\nbondholders were parties was settled out of court, and\r\nagreements ratified in London on the 22nd July and 28th\r\nAugust, 1878. The first agreement regulated the issue of\r\nthe second mortgage loan, the amount of which was fixed\r\nat \u00a3850,000, the subscribers to the loan of \u00a3450,000 in\r\n1873 receiving bonds for \u00a3600,000, and Montero Brothers\r\nbonds for \u00a3250,000. The second agreement provided\r\nsecurity as to also the first for the future payment of the\r\ninterest and of the redemption, and under the arrangements\r\nwhich were finally made the railways were delivered\r\nin February, 1879, to the National Nitrate Railways Company\r\nof Peru.\r\n\r\nVery soon afterwards a war, the great solvent of agreements\r\nas well as of treaties, broke out. Pisagua was\r\nbombarded and laid in ruins. The Chilian flag floated over\r\nthe whole province of Tarapac\u00e1, ports and pampas, ere the\r\nyear closed, and the Chilians began to work on the railway\r\nfor their own purposes. But in June, 1881, they handed\r\nthe line over to the National Nitrate Company of Peru.\r\nThe dislocation and confusion which followed the war\r\nprecluded any attempt to develop the enterprise till\r\nAugust, 1882, when a company was formed in London\r\nwith a capital of \u00a31,200,000, and a loan of \u00a31,100,000 at\r\nsix per cent. interest was sent on the market by Messrs.\r\nHuth & Co. The new Nitrate Railway Company by mortgage\r\ndeed a few days afterwards provided for the payment\r\nof the unredeemed capital of the mortgage of 1872, and\r\nfor the substitution of the new mortgage as a first charge\r\non the railway, the second mortgage of \u00a3850,000 coming",
  "p2230.png": "next with certain variations in the arrangements for redemption.\r\nIn 1888 the portions of the two loans which\r\nhad not then been redeemed were paid off, and a new loan\r\nof \u00a32,000,000 was issued at 5 per cent., which was the\r\nonly mortgage on the railway of which the directors\r\nshortly afterwards issued deferred shares for \u00a3180,000,\r\nthus completing the financial history of the line, which is\r\nnow engaged in active work at assured profits under the\r\nexcellent management of Mr. Rowland at Iquique and of\r\nMr. Clark at Pisagua. The map will give a better idea of\r\nthe railway as regards its course, stations, and branches\r\nthan any verbal description of mine.\r\n\r\nI have already said a few words of the magnitude of the\r\nworks at Iquique, a place of which I honestly confess I\r\nhad never heard until I was informed that I must give it\r\nas the address for my letters. I am not so much ashamed\r\nof my ignorance now that I know it is shared by so many\r\nmuch better informed people. A naval friend of mine\r\nacknowledged that he was considerably distressed when\r\nhe received an order during the war to look into the\r\nport of (what he thought must be called) \"Ikiki.\"\r\nSomething I think has slipped in in my earlier account\r\nof first impressions about a resemblance to Crewe. It is\r\nallowable to compare small things to great, and, with\r\na due regard to proportion, the comparison of the Nitrate\r\nRailway Terminus on the Pacific is not altogether unjustifiable.\r\nThere is a passenger station 170 feet long,\r\nprovided with booking offices and all sorts of appliances,\r\noffices for baggage and booking and despatch of goods,\r\nvestibules for first and second class passengers, waiting-*rooms,\r\noffices for the station master, for the telegraph\r\ninspectors, for documents, lamps, &c., roofed with galvanized\r\niron, solidly constructed with broad verandahs.",
  "p2240.png": "Another great building of similar size contains apartments\r\nfor the general manager, staff, accountants, and drawing\r\noffices, engineers' offices, telegraphs, &c. There are large\r\ngoods platforms for the jute bags going up to and the\r\nnitrate bags coming down from the pampas. Beyond there\r\nis a workshop 277 feet by 104 feet, provided with Stobardt\r\n& Pitt's travelling cranes for lifting engines, in which\r\neight engines can be repaired at a time. The whole of the\r\nrepairs is executed here, the engines, provided by Fowler\r\n& Fairlie, being of course sent from England. The boiler\r\nshop, 120 feet by 40 feet, contains boiler-plate roller,\r\npunching, and shearing machines, drilling machine, and\r\nthree furnaces. The smiths' shop, 95 feet by 56 feet, has\r\ntwelve fires, a furnace for tempering springs, a steam\r\nhammer, and overhead crane running the whole length\r\nof the shop. In the next machine shop, 132 feet by 46\r\nfeet, there are 24 machines, driven by a 34 horse-power\r\nhorizontal engine, supplied with steam from two single\r\nfurnace boilers 30 feet long by 6 feet wide. The round\r\nhouse contains 9 pits, each 50 feet long, all leading to one\r\nturn-table 45 feet in diameter. Then come the tire\r\nheating furnace, hydraulic wheel presses, carpenters' shop,\r\nmeasuring 180 feet by 72 feet, with a 10 horse-power\r\nhorizontal engine working the patent circular saw, band-*saw,\r\nand mortising machine. The running shed, 150 feet\r\nlong by 73 feet, is provided with 4 pits for the action of\r\nthe pumps, and there are 12 hydrants for filling tanks and\r\nboilers. Outside there are two coaling stages, 140 feet\r\nby 16 feet, and with 8 feet water alongside. The Pisagua\r\nterminus is nearly as well equipped as that at Iquique, and\r\nof the other stations on the line, of which I have made some\r\nmention in the chapter describing the journey from Iquique\r\nto the Pampas.",
  "p2250.png": "\r\nWhilst these sheets are in the press there is a question of\r\nthe highest importance in suspense; it may be, perhaps,\r\ndecided at this moment, but if the decision which the\r\nPresident and the Council of State announced last year with\r\nrespect to the annulment of the privileges of the Nitrate\r\nRailways Company be carried into effect, an unfavourable\r\nimpression with regard to the equity, in the best sense of\r\nthe word, of the Government of Chile, in its dealings with\r\nvested interests, may be created among the capitalists of\r\nEurope.[*]\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, the case stands thus. In 1888 the Government\r\nissued a decree declaring that the Nitrate Railway\r\nCompany had forfeited its rights and privileges, which had\r\nbeen given by the Government of Peru and acknowledged\r\nby Chile, under the concession of 1871 to Montero Bros.\r\nThat concession provided for the construction of a railway\r\nfrom Iquique to Pisagua (on conditions set forth elsewhere),\r\nand for an extension of the line to the frontier of\r\nBolivia. The rights as well as the privileges and monopolies\r\nwere transferred, with the consent of the Chilian\r\nGovernment, for the first part of the concession, to the\r\nRailway Company which has been formed to carry out the\r\nwork from Iquique to Pisagua. The part of the concession\r\nwhich related to the making of the railway to Bolivia was\r\nnot acquired by the company, but remained the property\r\nof the brothers Montero. They did not make the railway\r\nto Bolivia. Whereupon the Chilian Government decreed\r\nthat the privileges of the Nitrate Railway Company lapsed,\r\nand indicated that they were prepared to grant concessions\r\nto nitrate oficinas for making other railways in Tarapac\u00e1.\r\nThe Company appealed to the Supreme Court of Chile.\r\n\r\n* In the Appendix there will be found a summary of the concessions of the\r\nGovernments to the Nitrate Railway Companies.",
  "p2260.png": "Thereupon the Attorney-General lodged an objection to the\r\nappeal, alleging that the Courts of Law were not competent\r\nto deal with the issue, inasmuch as the President, as\r\nhead of the Executive, regarded the declaration of forfeiture\r\nas an administrative act, beyond their jurisdiction. The\r\nRailway Company were bound by the terms of their charter\r\nto refer questions in dispute between them and the Government\r\nto the Courts of Law of Chile. The Supreme Court\r\ndecided that they were competent to deal with the question\r\nof contract and the question of right. But the President,\r\nsupported by the Council of State, overriding both the\r\nreport of a committee of the Senate and the judgment of\r\nthe Supreme Court, insisted on the absolute right of the\r\nPresident to annul the privileges of the railway.\r\n\r\nAs the President and his Government refused to admit\r\nthe competency of their own Law Courts, the Company\r\nwas obliged to invoke the assistance of the home Government\r\nwhich, no doubt, with all due regard to the dignity\r\nand susceptibilities of Chile, authorised the British representative\r\nat Santiago to place before the Chilian Government\r\nthe view which it took of a matter affecting five\r\nmillions sterling of English capital, embarked in a legitimate\r\nand beneficial enterprise in the province of Tarapac\u00e1.\r\nNevertheless, a concession has been granted to one company[*]\r\nto make a railway from its oficina to a port on the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n* The Agua Santa.",

Colonel North\r\nintended to return to Santiago, and embarking at Valparaiso\r\nto proceed homewards, with some of his friends,\r\nby the Straits of Magellan. Others, amongst whom were\r\nmy wife and I, decided on continuing our journey northward\r\nto Panama, and to take there the most favourable\r\nopportunity that presented itself of journeying to Europe.\r\n\r\nOcean itineraries and local steamer tables were anxiously\r\nconsulted. Some were inclined to favour the idea of\r\ntaking the American steamer at Panama, and coasting for",
  "p2280.png": "three weeks along the western shore of Central America\r\nand Mexico to San Francisco, where several routes to\r\nAtlantic ports were open to them. Others were disposed to\r\ntake the steamer at Aspinwall for New Orleans. But there\r\nrose up the spectre of quarantine in the Mississippi.\r\nAnother route homewards, if the connections, which were\r\nalso harassed, however, by quarantine contingencies, were\r\ngood, presented itself vi\u00e1 the French steamers for Havre\r\nand Bordeaux, or by the Royal West India Mail packets.\r\nThe line of American steamers in connection with the\r\nPanama Railway between Aspinwall and New York\r\nappeared to offer, on the whole, the shortest and most\r\nconvenient access to the Atlantic lines. Eventually\r\nColonel North renounced the idea of returning to Santiago,\r\nand determined to travel with us to Panama.\r\n\r\nI had not been able to complete the circuit of the Nitrate\r\nRailway or to visit all the oficinas along its course, because\r\non the evening of the day of our excursion to Jaz-Pampa I\r\nhad to return to Primitiva and thence to descend to\r\nIquique, instead of continuing my journey to the Northern\r\nterminus of the line. Before our final departure from\r\nIquique the Colonel decided on making a marine excursion\r\nto Pisagua, and on June 3rd we embarked on our expedition,\r\nwhich gave me a good opportunity of visiting the other end\r\nof the Nitrate Railway, on board the Maria Luisa, one of\r\nthe water boats which the Tarapac\u00e1 Company employs\r\nfor the service of the towns along the coast. She is\r\nnot particularly fast, say seven knots an hour, but proved\r\nto be easy and comfortable. The sea was smooth, and we\r\nkept so close inshore that we disturbed the seals and sea-lions\r\non the reefs or playing about in the sea in such\r\nnumbers, that their round heads were to be seen bobbing up\r\nand down in all directions in front of our bow and on our",
  "p2290.png": "broadside. Myriads of pelicans were visible, steering their\r\ncourse in long lines or in dense columns, on the wing, bent\r\non some predatory enterprise, or settled down, island-like,\r\non their fishing grounds.\r\n\r\nWhenever there was a shoal of fish near the surface\r\nthe pelicans ascended to the height apparently of a\r\nhundred feet or thereabouts, and from time to time one of\r\nthem plunged like a meteorite into the sea, splashing up\r\nthe water, and rising with a fish to be pouched in his bill.\r\nThe fins of sharks and swordfish rising above the smooth\r\nswell showed that the fish had other enemies in their own\r\nelement close at hand. To these were added shoals of porpoises\r\nand dolphins around the steamer.\r\n\r\nThere were extensive patches of white on the ledges of\r\nrocks at the foot of the monotonous greyish-red mountainside\r\nwhich forms the western slope of the Andes along the\r\ncoast. It looked as though an army of whitewashers had\r\nbeen busily at work. They were due to beds of guano. The\r\ndeposits are protected as far as possible from private depredation\r\nby the Coastguards; but the Indians are acquainted\r\nwith the value of the material, and carry it when they can\r\ninto the interior to fertilise the land.\r\n\r\nAs there was plenty of what might be considered objects\r\nfor sport to be seen, an old Winchester rifle was produced\r\nfrom below, but I confess I was not sorry when\r\nefforts to mend the broken spring of the weapon, and get\r\nit into shooting order, proved unsuccessful. There were\r\nvery few objects of interest to attract attention on shore;\r\nand the seals, sharks, swordfish, and pelicans exclusively\r\noccupied our attention. It was a pleasure, after some hours'\r\nsteaming, to have the little bay, the small hamlet, and the\r\nstorehouses of C\u00e1leta Buena to look at.

The descent and ascent is very ingeniously\r\nregulated, but accidents have sometimes occurred. Captain\r\nCastle says:\r\n\r\n\"The port of Caleta[** C\u00e1leta elsewhere] Buena deserves some mention. It is\r\nsituated a little to the south of Mejillones Bay; a great\r\ndeal of the foreshore has been recovered from the sea at\r\nconsiderable labour and expense. Along this sea frontage\r\nruns a tram line; facing the tram line are large bodegas,\r\nconstructed of galvanised iron; to the northward of the\r\npier are the dwellings of the Administrador and Aduana,\r\nthe Pulperia, peons' cottages, bowling alleys, billiard-room,\r\nand workshops; on the extreme right, the water\r\nmaquina. The flag of Chile floats over all the principal\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the facilities that this port affords, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that it was only opened, by permission\r\nof the Government, at a time when the Nitrate Railway\r\nCompany were unable, from want of rolling stock, to\r\nmeet the requirements of the nitrate makers, and it may\r\nbe that since such an enormous sum has been laid out on\r\nthe incline railway and port by Campbell, Outram, and\r\nCo. (700,000 dollars), some concession should be made to\r\nthem either by the Government or by the Nitrate Railway\r\nCompany.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the steamer had passed a small town called\r\nMejillones, on the bay of that name, another of the small\r\nnitrate ports called Junin came in sight. A road in zigzag\r\nruns from the beach to the summit of the mountain to the\r\nnitrate oficina. Mr. Comber, of Jaz-Pampa, is under a",
  "p2310.png": "contract to deliver 3,600 quintals of nitrate every month\r\nto this port for shipment. We passed Caleta Buena and\r\nJunin without stopping or signalling, and the most careful\r\nscrutiny of the coast for the rest of the day revealed no\r\nobject of interest to look at, or to beguile the tedium of a\r\nmonotonous voyage, but we were near the end of our\r\njourney as the sun, ere it set in the sea, was lighting up\r\nthe mountain tops to the East.\r\n\r\nAt 5.30 P.M. the Maria Luisa anchored off Pisagua. It\r\nis an Iquique in miniature; there were the trains ascending\r\nand descending the mountain-side and the port between\r\nthe Pampas, exactly in the same manner, the bodegas, the\r\nrailway station, the houses, &c., all shrouded in the shadow\r\nof the mountain. There were twenty-five or thirty ships\r\nof large size anchored in the roadstead. The Railway\r\nStation, storehouses, and magazines gave an air of importance\r\nto the place which was not altogether sustained\r\nby nearer inspection, but as the inhabitants atone for the\r\nwant of colour in their surroundings by painting their\r\nhouses red, yellow, blue, orange, &c., Pisagua, illuminated\r\nby the rays of the sun declining in a bank of orange-tinted\r\nclouds, looked quite pretty and coquet from the sea.\r\nIt is the most northern port of the Nitrate Kingdom.\r\nThe surf was running high very near the little pier where\r\nthe Pisaguans were assembled to watch our arrival. A\r\nnumber of boats at once came off with Colonel North's\r\nfriends. We had to land, but it was not so easy to reach\r\nthe quay dryshod, notwithstanding the skill of the boatman;\r\nand probably some of the natives were not altogether\r\ndispleased, when the efforts of the strangers to get up\r\nthe steps before the water wet their feet, were occasionally\r\nunsuccessful. My wife, myself, and some others of\r\nthe party took up our quarters in Mr. Clarke's comfortable",
  "p2320.png": "residence at the Railway Station, where Mrs. Clarke gave\r\nus all a most kindly reception.\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking it was rather bold (tidal waves\r\nand earthquakes to wit) of our excellent host to trust his\r\nfamily and himself to a two-storeyed house, with the sea\r\nat its base and a mass of rock rising behind it, a spur\r\nfrom the imminent Andes. It is touching to see how the\r\ntraditions of the English household assert themselves under\r\nadverse circumstances. There is in every English house\r\non the coast the home drawing-room with mirrors, easy\r\nchairs, sofas, tables covered with albums, the piano, the\r\ninevitable photograph stand, the last assortment of books,\r\nillustrated papers, magazines, flowers in vases, caged birds\r\nin the verandah. Mr. Clarke's residence had not much\r\nroom to spare. The reception and sleeping rooms were on\r\nthe first floor; down below is the courtyard. In the\r\ncourtyard there is a little well, round which pigeons,\r\nducks, and poultry, useful adjuncts to the table--suffering\r\nmuch from the depredations of enormous rats--collect for\r\nbathing and drinking; there were plants in boxes, creepers\r\ncarefully tended up the lattice-work, and small plants to\r\nlend their green to the place, and a sleek llama with a soft\r\nblack curling coat, stalked about the enclosure inviting the\r\nchildren to come and play with it. I hope that neither\r\ntidal wave nor earthquake will ever visit that hospitable\r\nhouse. At night the sea breaking against the foundations\r\nof the house disturbed my rest, and I could not help\r\nthinking that it would be better if we were a little higher\r\nup the hill-side.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty to see at Pisagua. I am not speaking\r\nof the plants or of ferns, strange enough in composition\r\nand distribution, of the geological formations, of the railway\r\nclambering boldly to the sky line with its trains of",
  "p2330.png": "passengers, provisions and materials, up a mountain which\r\nlooks as steep as the side of a house, and vanishing on\r\nthe Pampas beyond, nor of the trains coming down in\r\nwell-ordered procession, laden with cargoes of nitrate\r\nsacks, nor of the activity and bustle in the Railway Terminus,\r\nwhere customs officers are weighing and officials\r\nare testing the nitrate bags accumulated in huge blocks\r\nby the wharves in readiness for shipment. I am alluding\r\nto the town itself.\r\n\r\nThe street of Pisagua, consisting of wooden houses, follows\r\nthe line of the shore. Stores full of ready-made\r\nclothes, ironmongery, agricultural implements, refreshment\r\nsaloons, two banks, merchants' offices, and bodegas\r\nlie at the foot of the mountains, which rise, almost from\r\nthe street, behind a chain of scarped hills of 500 or 600\r\nfeet high. A railway runs from the Custom House pier to\r\nthe Station, \u00e0 l'Americaine, through the street. The\r\nnames over the shops are German, Italian, English. The\r\nChilians say that these hills were trenched and defended by\r\nBolivian riflemen; that batteries, \u00e0 fleur d'eau, garrisoned\r\nby a brigade of Peruvian artillery, commanded the port,\r\nand that 1,200 Bolivians were in position behind their\r\nearthworks when the Chilian flotilla of nineteen men-of-war\r\nand transports, with an expeditionary army from\r\nAntofagasta, elated by the victory off Angamos and the\r\ncapture of the Huascar, appeared before it on 2nd November,\r\n1879. The Chilian men-of-war silenced the batteries\r\nin an hour. The Peruvian artillerists bolted from their\r\nguns. The Chilians, landing in detachments, were held in\r\ncheck under the fire of the enemy in the houses, hid\r\nbehind nitrate bags and up the hill-sides, till the fleet once\r\nmore swept the shore and drove the allies from their\r\nshelter; but the Chilians did not succeed finally in occupy-*",

I am inclined to think that with troops of\r\ngreater tenacity to face them they would have paid dearly\r\nfor the attempt to take Pisagua. The shore batteries were\r\nobviously badly armed and were probably worse manned.\r\nMeantime the Chilian General-in-Chief had disembarked a\r\ncorps of Chilians at Junin without resistance, and was\r\nmarching along the coast. Villamil and Granier, the\r\ngenerals of Bolivia, and the Peruvian chief, Buendia, with\r\nthe view of concentrating all their forces at Tarapac\u00e1, fled\r\nwith their broken bands towards Dolores, whence they were\r\ndriven soon after. The Chilians lost in killed and wounded\r\n350 men out of the 2,000 who landed; but they secured\r\nthe railways, stores, magazines, distilling apparatus, and a\r\nbase of operations, which they lost no time in utilising.\r\n\r\nAfter I had taken a look at the position in the early\r\nmorning, I strolled down the street, and then turned back\r\nto the railway terminus. There was a train starting at\r\nseven o'clock for the Pampas, filled with men, women, and\r\nchildren, mostly Chilenos, third-class passengers, whose\r\nfares are regulated at five cents. a mile--the dollar just now\r\nis worth 2s. 3d.--so that the fares are a little more I think\r\nthan those of the parliamentary trains at home. Such a\r\nvariety of headdresses, indeed of dress and physiognomy, I\r\nnever saw before; long-faced, large-nosed, straight-haired\r\nBolivians, barring the full beards and whiskers of the\r\nAsiatic, quite Afghan in type; Indians with wire-like\r\ntresses, broad cheeks, square and firm-set jaws, piercing\r\nsmall black eyes; Chilenos, like Basques or Biscayans, who\r\nmight have been just landed from the northern ports of\r\nSpain--chattering, laughing, and gesticulating, all smoking,\r\nall with bundles--some fair-haired Germans, here and\r\nthere a negro or a mulatto, probably of Peru.",

  "p2350.png": "\r\nAs I was watching the departure of the motley multitude,\r\nI made the acquaintance of an English gentleman,\r\nconnected with the place, and in the course of a conversation\r\nall too short I learned a good deal about\r\nPeru. He had settled down on the banks of a tributary of\r\nthe Amazon, a paradise for the naturalist and the sportsman;\r\nhe had laid out his fortune, and after years of\r\nstruggle he had abandoned his hacienda in disgust, and\r\nleft it to anyone who chose to come in and take possession.\r\n\"I get letters from tax-collectors and agents and officials\r\nof all kinds,\" he said, \"but I never open them when I see\r\nthe postmark, for I know what they are about. There is\r\nno law. There is no labour to be had. The taxes are\r\nenormous. It is a hopeless country.\" He had but a very\r\nbad opinion indeed of the future of Peru. The future\r\nmight either mean a revolution, which would rather make\r\nwhat was bad still worse, or it might mean a protectorate\r\nwhich could, he thought, only end in the destruction as a\r\nself-governing state of the Republic.\r\n\r\nFrom the Station I walked to the beach, close to the\r\nrailway, where the surf was breaking on the rocks, and the\r\nbolsa men were loading the lighters with nitrate, an operation\r\nexceedingly well-managed and very interesting to\r\nlook at. The lighters cannot approach the shore owing\r\nto the surf, and they can only lie at the pier when\r\nit is very smooth indeed, and that very seldom happens\r\non this Pacific coast. So the nitrate bags are carried\r\nfrom the wharf by the bolsa men off to the lighters, which\r\nlie outside the line of breakers. \"Practice makes perfect.\"\r\nThe bolsa is simply a couple of large bladders,\r\nwhich are made from the skins of the sea-lions, which are\r\ndressed and trimmed by the Chilians along the coast, the\r\nextremities being closed and sewn up in the form of a",
  "p2360.png": "bolster with sharp ends, or something like enormous cigars;\r\nthey naturally need no water-proofing, and they are exceedingly\r\nlight and durable. Two of these are fastened together\r\nwith a platform on the top, very like the double ship which\r\nran between Dover and Calais; they are blown out artificially,\r\nand it is astonishing to see how cleverly a Chilian\r\nwill distend the cylinders by his breath. I have been exercised\r\nby the name of the man who does this work; he is\r\ncalled a cachuchero; now a cachucha is \"a sort of cap,\" \"a\r\nnational dance,\" or \"an air to accompany it,\" and unless the\r\nbolsa man is supposed to dance on the waves, there seems\r\nto me no reason for his being called cachuchero. Whatever\r\nthe reason of his name, the fellow is adroit, strong and\r\nskilful in his trade.\r\n\r\nThe sea has cut out the softer part of the rocks and formed\r\nlittle docks just large enough for a bolsa to float in. The\r\nnitrate bags are stowed in tiers on the beach, under neat sheds\r\nbelonging to the railway, beyond the reach of the surf. Now\r\nhere is a bolsa in the caleta, its harbour, so to speak. The\r\nboatman is on the shingle, and is steadying his craft. A\r\nroller has just passed away seaward. Five men, stripped to\r\nthe waist, with trousers tucked up above the knee, each with\r\na bag of nitrate on his back, are ready. They run one after\r\nthe other, place their load on the platform of the bolsa,\r\nthen as the next roller comes in the boatman jumps on the\r\nbolsa and seizes his oar. The bolsa is carried out by the\r\nreflux, and, floating lightly over the surf, is dexterously\r\npropelled by the boatman, or bolsa man, till he comes alongside\r\nthe lighter. The latter is loaded, and is brought\r\nalongside the ship by the crew, where the cargo is transferred\r\ninto the hold with such rapidity that twenty-five tons\r\nof nitrate, the usual freight of the larger lighters, is hoisted\r\non deck in less than half-an-hour. Great care must be taken",
  "p2370.png": "in placing the nitrate on the platform of the bolsa, putting\r\nit in the lighter, and carrying it to the ship; for the wetting\r\nof nitrate means heavy loss. The bags are put away\r\nbelow by a stevedore, who is paid 7 dols. for 1,000 quintals,\r\neach quintal being 100-1/2 pounds. A strong man can stow\r\n3,000 quintals a day.\r\n\r\nAny one who doubts whether men can get up muscle\r\nupon beans, has only to look at these nitrate carriers. From\r\nearly morning they work for about four hours, carrying\r\nbags of nitrate weighing from 300 to 310 pounds all over,\r\nthen they have a meal--a large one--of peroto. At twelve\r\no'clock they begin once more. They leave off in three hours,\r\nthe six-and-a-half hours' work being quite as much as\r\nthey do in the day. They belong to a trades' union, or\r\nGremio, to which a charter was given by the Government\r\nof Peru, just before Tarapac\u00e1 was annexed. They\r\nform a public company, with a commandant, overseers, clerk\r\nand labourers; they have their school, their account in the\r\nNational Bank, and their reserve fund. The men's wages\r\nare fixed by the Gremio; the variable exchange affects the\r\nvalue, but it may be put down roughly that they get from\r\nten to eleven shillings a day, or less than two shillings an\r\nhour for their working time.\r\n\r\nNot very far from this scene there was an exhibition of\r\nanother kind. Close in shore boats are passing to and fro.\r\nOne of them stops. A man appears with a small net over his\r\nshoulders, at the bow; in his hands, which he holds over his\r\nhead, he has a stone. He dives, and is lost to view for half\r\na minute. Then he rises, clambers into the boat and\r\nempties his net; he is diving for mussels! The water is\r\nso clear that he can see them at the bottom. Sometimes a\r\nweighted basket is let down from the boat by a rope, into\r\nwhich the diver puts the shellfish; he gives the rope a",
  "p2380.png": "tug, and he comes up to take breath. Sometimes he rises\r\nby the aid of his feet alone, holding the mussels pressed\r\nagainst his chest.\r\n\r\nAt the south end of the Bay there is a reef, on which the\r\nsea, breaking continuously, spreads out a milk-white expanse\r\nof foam, and in the midst of this you see, in the sun,\r\nshining, sleek, black creatures gambolling in pursuit of their\r\nprey. These are sea-lions, or large seals, which abound\r\nalong the coast; they are protected by the port authorities,\r\nas a couple of my companions found to their cost on one\r\noccasion, when they made a shooting excursion from the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nI paused outside the storehouse at the station to look at\r\nthe operation of sampling the nitrate. The Custom House\r\nofficer, the agents of the nitrate sellers and buyers, notebooks\r\nand ink-horn in hand, in front of a pair of scales,\r\nconstitute a little court. The porters place on the scale five\r\nbags of nitrate, which are accurately weighed. Then a\r\nsample of the nitrate was taken from each bag and placed in a\r\nbox, which was locked up till the quality can be tested and\r\nanalysed. The standard of nitrate of soda is 95 per cent.,\r\nand if nitrate of an inferior quality is sold, the oficina has\r\nto pay the purchaser in proportion to the deterioration\r\nbelow the standard. This is ascertained at Valparaiso by\r\nthe chemists appointed for the purpose, and there is an\r\narbitrator, also an official, whose judgment is final in case\r\nof dispute.\r\n\r\nThere are at this moment twenty-seven vessels in the\r\nharbour, riding with their bows pointing south towards\r\nthe swell and the wind, which at this time of the year\r\ncomes generally from Cape Horn. There are some ten or\r\ntwelve barques, the rest being three-masted schooners and\r\nbrigs. Lighters are alongside most of them, and a line of",

There were so many friends coming off to say\r\ngood-bye, and to take a last look and a cocktail--(not by\r\nany means the last--it is always the time to take one along\r\nthe coast; of it as of the Royal Prerogative it may be\r\nsaid, \"Nullum tempus occurrit\")--that the time passed\r\nquickly, and the steamer did not leave till noon. The wind\r\nfrom the south, which favoured us on our way north, was\r\nnaturally against us on our return to Iquique. The Maria\r\nLuisa made a hard fight against the head sea, and was\r\ngreatly agitated in the combat, so that the ladies, after a\r\nstruggle on deck, took refuge from the war of waters in\r\ntheir cabin. The appropriate water-boat, however, took us\r\nsafely, if slowly, back to Iquique.

Valparaiso\r\nhas been twice destroyed by earthquakes, and I have\r\nspoken already of the ruin of Concep\u00e7ion in 1822 and\r\n1835. From Valparaiso up to Arica the coast is much\r\nharassed. Arica, Callao, Quito, &c., are frequently visited,\r\nand the towns on the seaboard of Ecuador have, from\r\ntime to time, suffered severely. The merry month of May\r\nseems to be a very favourite time for bad shocks--some of\r\nthe most severe earthquakes recorded have happened in it.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately lost the memorandum-book in which I\r\nrecorded my earthquake experiences at Iquique and on the\r\nPampas, but I am sure that during the latter part of the\r\ntime we were on the coast, between the former town and\r\nPisagua, we had two shocks a week.",
  "p2410.png": "\r\nNone of the temblors which occurred during our stay\r\nin Chile were severe. The slightest was, however, sufficient\r\nto arouse us to a condition of vivid expectancy and rapt\r\nattention. When once we felt the earth shaking and heard\r\nthe doors and windows clattering, peace of mind was at an\r\nend till motion and noise ceased. Our first experience was\r\nat Santiago. They were more frequent soon after our\r\narrival at Iquique, but one or two were so slight that we\r\nwould have doubted if the vibration was not due to some\r\npassing waggon, but for the evidence of other people. I\r\nsay \"we,\" as my wife, the companion of my solicitude,\r\nwas generally the first to detect the advent of the earth\r\nwave.\r\n\r\nThe favourite time for the commotion was just at the end\r\nof our first sleep. Sometimes there would be a shake in the\r\nnight, but generally the quakes began seriously about seven\r\no'clock in the morning. Sometimes a strange noise would\r\nprecede the shake--a sound like the roar of the sea, or of\r\na distant railway train. Only there was in it a subterranean\r\nelement also--as if the train were in a tunnel--and\r\nthen doors and windows shook, and crockery and glass\r\nclattered, the clothes hung up on the walls waved to and\r\nfro, the bed was shaken, and it seemed as if some one\r\nbeneath were kicking it violently. Then after a few\r\nseconds, during which we watched and listened in rapt\r\nattention, the tumult subsided, and there was at once a\r\nglow of an inward satisfaction, and audible expression\r\nof it on our part, that it was all over. However, that\r\nfeeling of thankfulness was sharply dissipated on several\r\noccasions by the speedy recurrence of the shock. No one\r\nknows when and where and how an earthquake is going\r\nto end.\r\n\r\nOne morning we had to endure three shakes at intervals",
  "p2420.png": "of some minutes; and I am bound to say that familiarity\r\nin our case did not breed contempt or indifference. Nor\r\nare the people, to the manner of earthquakes born, at all\r\nmore callous than strangers. Indeed it may be true that\r\nthey are more nervous. They have seen--many of them--the\r\nruin wrought by these dreadful agencies; they have\r\nheard from their elders of the destruction of cities by earthquakes--of\r\nwidespread wrack and ruin by the dreaded\r\ntidal-waves along the coast--of whole towns overwhelmed,\r\nwith their inhabitants, by the sea. The visitor is shown\r\nthe remains of the mischief worked in a few seconds by the\r\nearthquake of such a year--the marks which indicate the\r\ncourse and extent of such and such a wave are pointed out\r\nto him, and the story is illustrated by narratives of hair-*breadth\r\nescapes and dreadful adventure. The effect of these\r\nexperiences on the minds of the inhabitants is evinced by\r\nthe readiness with which they receive as authentic vague,\r\nand often exaggerated, reports of the destructive results of\r\nearthquakes along the coast.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a severe shock, the inhabitants of coast-*towns,\r\nlike Iquique, generally make for the open--then\r\ntheir eyes instinctively turn seawards--they are warned\r\nto look for the dreaded wave, of which the first token\r\nis the sudden retreat of the water on the shore. The\r\nsea retires as if it were sucked, or drawn, back by an\r\nunseen agency, and then it gathers to form the advance\r\nguard of the irresistible column of the tidal wave which\r\nrolls on like a green hillside till it reaches the reefs\r\nin thunder crested with foam, sweeps over the beach for\r\ngreat distances inland, and high up on shore, overwhelms\r\neverything within its ruinous range. The recession of\r\nthe sea is attributed to an upheaval of the land temporarily,\r\nor to the influence of the distant wave which is",
  "p2430.png": "forming for its irruption, after the manner in which the\r\nwater retires from a beach when a steamer is passing.\r\nThat is Darwin's illustration. But there is no satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the modus operandi in the creation\r\nof the wave itself, as far as I know. There is only\r\none agreeable circumstance--rather let me say everything\r\nabout these tidal-waves is disagreeable, with one exception--there\r\nis an interval between the earthquake and the\r\ngenesis of the wave--it may be half an hour or more.\r\nTherefore, although men's minds--and women's--are not\r\nin peace after the shock, and their eyes are fixed on the\r\nocean for many minutes, they have time to escape towards\r\nthe rising ground if it be in the daytime. The lines of\r\nretreat and the heights to seek for refuge near each town\r\nare well known and designated beforehand. I confess it\r\nwas not a line of retreat I was at all anxious to follow\r\nwhen it was shown to me at Iquique.\r\n\r\nSeveral notices of earthquakes are briefly entered in my\r\nscribbling journal in March, April, May, and June--some\r\non the coast, some at Santiago, one or two on the Pampas,\r\nand a considerable number at Iquique, but no details are\r\ngiven. The smaller demonstrations have a great family\r\nresemblance to each other. It is believed that the bodies\r\noften found in mines, &c., on the coast, are those of people\r\nwho were swallowed up in these convulsions. Very recently\r\ntwo men who were journeying to Iquique found, in\r\na hollow in the ground, the mummified corpse of an Indian\r\nwoman with a child in her arms which she was feeding\r\nwhen they were instantaneously killed either by lightning\r\nor by an earthquake. They had remained for hundreds of\r\nyears there, and people who saw the remains at Se\u00f1or\r\nZuberia's office thought they could recognise an expres-*",

So I was up\r\nin good time for early breakfast and for the special train,\r\nwhich started at 8.30 to make a run to Jaz-Pampa and La\r\nPaccha, visiting several oficinas in the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 2nd. (Second Sunday after Ascension.[**ckd TIA P2])--Such a\r\nshaking this morning! As I was getting up, at 7.35, there",
  "p2450.png": "was first the usual underground 'growl,' then in a second\r\nor two, rattle! rattle! rattle! went the doors and windows\r\nin our room, and the outer verandah shook visibly. It\r\nwas only for a moment. 'That was a good one!' quoth my\r\nwife, with the air of a connoisseur in these things, a little\r\npale all the same. (It is her general remark now, pour\r\nencourager l'autre.) The words were not well out of her\r\nmouth when the rattle was at work again louder and\r\nstronger, and this time a giant below gave a kick to the\r\nfloor that shook the bed and transmitted the blow to our\r\nbodies very forcibly! Then that commotion ceased, and we\r\npulled ourselves together again. In a minute more there was\r\na third shock, much more prolonged, but not so violent. I\r\nwent on the leads, and looked out on the port. There was\r\nthe usual surf on the rocks, and the vessels in the roads\r\nwere rolling, as is their custom--nothing more. The earthquake\r\nwas mentioned casually among my friends. Different\r\nimpressions concerning the shake--some thought it slight;\r\nothers confessed they thought it was quite strong enough....\r\nThe ladies, with the exception of my wife, who is\r\nbad at boating and ladder-climbing, went on board H.M.S.\r\nCaroline, Sir W. Wiseman, to tea in the afternoon. They\r\nwere told by the officers that the shock had been plainly\r\nfelt in the ship. At 4.20 P.M., as my wife and I were\r\nsitting on the balcony, there was another quake. Four in a\r\nday is more than sufficient! It is very astonishing how\r\nsoon people, acting on the Duke of Wellington's maxim:\r\n'Never be afraid of a danger when it's over,' recover when\r\nthe quake is really quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Left Iquique for Pisagua in the North 'water-boat,'\r\nMaria Luisa, with the Colonel, the ladies, and some others\r\nof our party; Mrs. Russell remained behind.

Heard there had\r\nbeen a severe shake here yesterday, and on our way to Mr.\r\nClarke's house, saw a wall which had been thrown down\r\nby the side of the street. It is probable that the shock ran\r\nall along the coast for many hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\n\"June 3rd.--It is reported from Arica that there were\r\ntwenty-one shocks there yesterday, so we have no right to\r\ncomplain of our perturbation. It is a pity some system of\r\naccurate observation and record is not adopted by the\r\nGovernment. There are Chilian and American telegraph\r\nstations in all the towns, and if proper registers were kept\r\nat them, of time when, duration, and the like, a deal of\r\nvaluable, or at any rate interesting, information would be\r\naccumulated.\"\r\n\r\nThat same night there was, as we heard afterwards,\r\nanother considerable shock at Iquique at 3.30 A.M., but we\r\nhad no further personal experience of earthquakes that I\r\ncan remember.\r\n\r\nI had felt in other lands the truly awful and unnerving\r\nsensation--the fearful apprehension of a greater wrath to\r\ncome--of which Darwin has given such an accurate analysis\r\nin his account of the shock he experienced at Valdivia in\r\n1835:--\r\n\r\n\"A bad earthquake at once destroys our oldest associations;\r\nthe earth, the very emblem of solidity, has moved\r\nbeneath our feet like a thin crust over a fluid; one second\r\nof time has created in the mind a strange sense of\r\ninsecurity, which hours of reflection would not have\r\nproduced. In the forest, as a breeze moved a tree, I felt\r\nonly the earth tremble, but saw no other effect. Captain\r\nFitzroy and some officers were at the town during the\r\nshock, and there the scene was more striking; for\r\nalthough the houses, from being built of wood, did not",
  "p2470.png": "fall, they were violently shaken, and the boards creaked\r\nand rattled together. The people rushed out of doors in\r\nthe greatest alarm. It is these accompaniments that\r\ncreate that perfect horror of earthquakes, experienced by\r\nall who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.\r\nWithin the forest it was a deeply interesting, but by\r\nno means an awe-exciting phenomenon. The tides were\r\ncuriously affected. The great shock took place at the\r\ntime of low water: and an old woman who was on the\r\nbeach told me that the water flowed very quickly, but not\r\nin great waves, to high-water mark, and then as quickly\r\nreturned to its proper level; this was also evident by the\r\nline of wet sand. This same kind of quick but quiet\r\nmovement in the tide happened a few years since at\r\nChiloe, during a slight earthquake, and created much\r\ncauseless alarm. In the course of the evening there were\r\nmany weaker shocks, which seemed to produce in the\r\nharbour the most complicated currents, and some of great\r\nstrength.... Earthquakes alone are sufficient to\r\ndestroy the prosperity of any country. If beneath England\r\nthe now inert subterranean forces should exert those\r\npowers, which most assuredly in former geological ages\r\nthey have exerted, how completely would the entire\r\ncondition of the country be changed! What would\r\nbecome of the lofty houses, thickly packed cities, great\r\nmanufactories, the beautiful public and private edifices?\r\nIf the new period of disturbances were first to commence\r\nby some great earthquake in the dead of night, how\r\nterrific would be the carnage! England would at once be\r\nbankrupt; all papers, records, and accounts would from\r\nthat moment be lost. Government being unable to collect\r\nthe taxes, and failing to maintain its authority, the hand\r\nof violence and rapine would remain uncontrolled. In",
  "p2480.png": "every large town famine would go forth, pestilence and\r\ndeath following in its train.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the incidents which the great naturalist has\r\nsketched with a master hand have occurred on the Pacific\r\nCoast, but Darwin appears to have exaggerated the consequences\r\nof earthquakes in the dictum that they \"alone are\r\nsufficient to destroy the prosperity of any country.\" They\r\nhave not by any means effected the ruin of Central American\r\nand South American States, which have been cruelly\r\nvexed by the severest manifestations of their irresistible\r\npower, nor can it be admitted that England would at once\r\nbe made bankrupt by an earthquake or by a series of them,\r\nthough it is quite possible that the result of a series of\r\nshocks in our great cities would be of an appalling and\r\nfearful character. It is held by some Egyptologues that\r\nthe Temples at Karnak were laid in ruins by earthquakes,\r\nbut the force which laid pylon, pillar, and obelisk prostrate\r\nwould suffice to destroy the grandest works in London\r\nwithout the consequences imagined by Darwin to be\r\nnecessary. Still let us hope and pray that the subterranean\r\nforces of which he speaks may be content to remain inert\r\nas they have been so long content to do after they rested\r\nfrom their labours.\r\n\r\nFortunately for our own poor nerves and my legs we\r\nhad no occasion to fly from tidal wave, or to escape from\r\nfalling houses, but it was not pleasant to be told at first\r\nthat it was just as well not to close the bedroom door, lest\r\na shock should jam it and prevent our opening it if the\r\nhouse were falling.\r\n\r\nOn our return from the Pampas to Iquique I put in\r\nshape some notes I made during my visit to Chile. Those\r\nwhich relate to the Nitrate of Soda oficinas have been\r\nworked out in the previous pages, which my readers have",

Champagne--exceedingly\r\nsweet--which it was obligatory at all events to taste,\r\nwas handed round, and after an interchange of civil inquiries\r\nand answers on both sides, we bowed and shook hands\r\nand retired. The visit was returned by the Intendente and\r\nhis wife in due course. The gentlemen who fill the post of\r\nIntendente are generally politicians belonging, it is needless\r\nto say, to the party in power--very often lawyers not\r\nin great practice, and as their office is only held for a\r\nterm--I think of five years--it is not the practice of\r\nIntendentes generally to dissipate their income in prodigal\r\nliving or profuse hospitality.\r\n\r\nApropos of the power of the Intendente, it would seem\r\nthat it is not to be lightly questioned in the public press,\r\nat all events. On my return one day from a round of visits",
  "p2510.png": "I was informed that the editor of a paper of high character\r\nwho had just been released from prison for some ill-*considered\r\nobservations on the conduct of the powers that\r\nbe, was about to be subjected to penal consequences for\r\npublishing documents in his paper of an official character,\r\nsaid to have been improperly obtained; but there was, it\r\nwas stated, no legal evidence of the fact. The editor left\r\nIquique to avoid further annoyance. There is, however,\r\nconsiderable licence allowed to the expression of abstract\r\nopinion and to political discussion in the press, and there\r\nwas, for example, one paper in Iquique which might\r\nbe said to advocate a re-vindication of the territory of\r\nTarapac\u00e1 and Arica by Peru \u00e0 la Alsace-Lorraine. Se\u00f1or\r\nZegers, formerly secretary of General Iglesias, ex-President\r\nof Peru, is the editor of Il Progreso, a paper which he\r\nconducts with sprightliness and ability; and he manages,\r\nwithout offence to Chilian susceptibilities, to imply that he\r\nis attached to Peru, and regrets her overthrow in the last\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the Intendente his post, when we first\r\narrived at Iquique, was filled by the accomplished Don\r\nGonzalo Bulnes (son of the distinguished General and\r\nPresident), who has written an exceedingly complete\r\nhistory of the Chilian Liberating Expedition, which his\r\nfather led to Peru. It was Se\u00f1or Bulnes who originated\r\nthe d\u00e9jeuner at Cavancha to General Baquedano and his\r\ncompanions before they sailed to Europe as members of the\r\nmilitary commission constituted by the President and the\r\nGovernment of Chile to report upon the military establishments\r\nof the great Powers, to which Colonel North\r\nand I were invited. It was interesting to meet one who\r\nhad led the Chilian Army in the victorious campaign which\r\nput an end to the war with Peru by placing Lima in the",
  "p2520.png": "power of the conquerors and the country in possession of\r\ntheir armies. A very modest man--saying little, and\r\ndesirous of silence rather than of speech, Baquedano is not\r\nimposing in appearance or in manner, but he is respected\r\nby his countrymen and he is said to be free from the ambition\r\nwhich in South American Republics often makes\r\nsuccessful soldiers dangerous citizens. Colonel Bulnes, one\r\nof his companions, bears a high reputation; but I doubt\r\nif many of the military gentlemen they will meet in Europe\r\nhave paid attention to the details of the singularly successful\r\nand well-designed aggressive operations which assured\r\nthe predominance of Chile on the Western shore of the\r\nSouth American Continent.\r\n\r\nIt is not without reason that foreigners in Chile attribute\r\nto the natives an unusual love of litigation. In a\r\ncountry with a population far less than that of London,\r\nthe number of lawyers is astonishing, and the daily papers\r\nin the cities contain long lists of causes in the courts, of\r\nwhich very many relate to disputes concerning property,\r\nmining rights, and commercial transactions. There is an\r\nelaborate system of criminal and civil jurisprudence, and\r\na large establishment of judges.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the impediments which undoubtedly\r\nexist to the establishment of intimate relations between\r\nthe Chilians and the strangers within their gates, the\r\nlatter, after a residence in the country, are generally\r\nattached to it, and if they cannot form close and warm\r\nfriendships, establish many pleasant relations. Indeed, let\r\nus admit that in any country under the sun, foreign\r\nresidents are necessarily not included in the intimacy\r\nwhich exists amongst the families of residents with whom\r\nthey are brought into every-day intercourse by business\r\nassociations. In Chile the restraint which is imposed by",
  "p2530.png": "difference of race and speech is intensified by national\r\npeculiarities and sentiment. The people are of the Latin\r\nrace, and they are Roman Catholics, not indeed of the\r\nstrictest, but nevertheless they are by no means disposed\r\nto regard heretics with favour. The strangers come to\r\nthe country poor; and they go away or remain amongst\r\nthem rich. They take the lead in commercial enterprise;\r\nthey practise as physicians, barristers, engineers; they\r\nestablish prosperous banks, commercial houses, agencies;\r\nthey work railroads, coal and copper mines, and control\r\nthe markets. Their descendants--McIvers, McKennas,\r\nEdwards--occupy great positions in the Chilian world.\r\nThe Chilian has more than one barrier to oppose to their\r\nprogress; he has the constitution, the legislature, the clergy,\r\nthe women--or let me say the ladies, who are not, however,\r\nalways hostile--but he cannot check it, or at least,\r\nhe has failed to do so up to the present. Over and above\r\nall his impedimenta he has a facility for litigation, a system\r\nof jurisprudence, and a fertility of legal invention, all of\r\nwhich he uses with singular ability to harass his enemies\r\nand rivals. Would it, however, be so very surprising if the\r\npeople of Chile declared that they would get rid of all\r\nforeigners if they could? They have not done so, but the\r\nexistence of a desire among certain classes to handicap\r\nimmigrant capitalists and manufacturers is proved by the\r\nconstant allusions in the press to the good time coming,\r\nwhen \"Chile for the Chilians\" will be more than a national\r\naspiration--when it will be the statement of an accomplished\r\nfact. Fortunately the President and the oligarchy\r\nat the head of affairs are men of intelligence, as liberal as\r\nthey are strong, and there is no probability that the\r\nRepublic of Chile will forget what it owes in any way\r\nto foreign capital and enterprise, or that it will ever give",
  "p2540.png": "the stranger reason to refrain from joining in the cry\r\n\"Viva Chile!\"\r\n\r\nThe short time which elapsed at Iquique after our arrival\r\nwas devoted to much packing. We dined the evening\r\nsubsequent to our return with Mr. and Mrs. Clarke, and\r\nmet some interesting people, among whom there was one\r\nwith personal experiences of the grievous wreck of the\r\nCotopaxi, which will be talked of by the survivors \"on the\r\ncoast\" for many a long day. We devoted June 6th to\r\nvisiting our friends in Iquique, ending with a drive \"by\r\nthe sad sea wave\"--which was tumbling in magnificent\r\nrollers on the beach--to Cavancha for the last time.\r\n\r\nOur departure from Iquique was fixed for the 7th June,\r\nand our berths were engaged by telegraph at Valparaiso on\r\nboard the Cachapoal, one of the Chilian Company's coast\r\nline, which was scheduled to arrive at Panama on June\r\n20th. It was natural that our last night on shore should\r\nbe made the occasion of a farewell banquet, but the\r\ntravellers had to face a divided duty, for, unaware that\r\nMr. Dawson claimed the greater number of her intended\r\nguests--among whom I was one--Mrs. Rowland had\r\narranged a dinner for all the party, which taxed the\r\nresources of Iquique, and as we could not dine in two\r\nplaces at the same time, we were not united at one table.\r\n\r\nExcept at the clubs, and of ball nights, people go to bed\r\nearly at Iquique. It was a very pleasant dinner, as it was\r\nwont to be at our hosts', but there was a dance to follow\r\nand a prospect of a late night. I was tired at the end of\r\na long day, and so I set out to walk from Mr. Dawson's\r\nto Mr. Rowland's, a few hundred yards off. It was bright\r\nmoonlight. I was walking in the middle of the road,\r\none side of the street being in the shade, when two men\r\nstepped out from a doorway in the dark a little in front",
  "p2550.png": "and advanced as if to stop me. I had nothing but a stick--a\r\nstout one--in my hand, but as they came near I halted\r\nand shook it at them, saying, in a loud voice, \"Adelante!\"\r\nWhereupon the fellows turned and fled, disappearing round\r\nthe corner of the street to my great satisfaction! In an\r\ninstant afterwards I heard the shrill whistle of a policeman,\r\nwhom the steps of the fugitives had summoned to\r\nthe spot, and who came up to see what manner of man I\r\nwas; being satisfied, apparently, that I was not dangerous,\r\nhe followed till he saw me turn in at Mr. Rowland's house.\r\nIt seems I had inadvertently used a word of power in addressing\r\nthe men in the street. I meant to say, \"Stand\r\nback!\"--instead of which I had invited the men to\r\n\"Come on!\" The invitation so disconcerted them that\r\nthey adopted a course which was much more agreeable to\r\nme than if they had taken me at my word. My friends\r\nwere greatly amused when I told them the story. I should\r\nmention that it is the habit of the police in Chilian cities\r\nto notify when a stranger enters a street at night by a\r\nwhistle; he announces in like manner to his comrade\r\nwhen the stranger has passed. As the conductors of the\r\ntramway carriages also clear the way by whistling, the\r\nearly night at Santiago and other towns is made hideous\r\nby the ceaseless \"siffleing.\"\r\n\r\nFROM MY DIARY.\r\n\r\n\"June 7th.--Our last day at Iquique.

The Captain, Captain Chase, an American who has\r\nbeen some time on the coast, did his best to accommodate\r\nthe party, and succeeded. The Colonel had, of course, to\r\nmake a speech, and in alluding with emotion to the early\r\nfriends he saw around him, and to the struggles in which\r\nthey had shared long ago, he touched a chord which\r\nvibrated in every heart. On the aforesaid coast meetings\r\nand partings--and indeed the intervals between them--are\r\nvery much devoted to libations, not immoderate but\r\nconstant. The deck of the Cachapoal was a prolonged\r\nscene of affectionate and sorrowful leavetaking till it was\r\ntime for those who were not bound northwards to go on\r\nshore.\"",

There was the train travelling up the mountain-*side\r\nin pursuit of the tiny smoke-puffing objects gaining\r\nthe summit of the plateau--the surf-lined coast, the factory\r\nchimneys, the cathedral dome, the gasworks, the railway,\r\nthe foundry, the bay and its tiers of ships rolling in the\r\nswell, the white houses of Cavancha in the distance.

The ingenuity of\r\nthe captains in punishing the delinquents, though it is\r\nexhibited in vain, is not always commendable. On one\r\noccasion five stowaways were secured with rope round the\r\ncoating of a boiler; the unfortunate wretches, as they felt\r\nthe heat on one side, pulled to get away from it. The effort\r\nbrought those on the other side into closer contact; and\r\nso the struggle went on till it was thought they had had\r\nenough of it. Sometimes the unfortunates, in their devices\r\nto hide themselves, meet with terrible punishment. Four\r\nstowaways managed to get along by the shaft, and settled\r\nthemselves down, as they thought very comfortably, in the\r\nspace left for the rudder head astern. As long as the ship\r\nwas at anchor they were safe, but it so happened, when the\r\nship got under weigh, that the rudder was put to port or\r\nstarboard, as the case might be, and three of them were\r\ncrushed to death at once. \"These Chilians are splendid\r\nmaterial for soldiers,\" said one of my friends; \"they don't\r\ncare for pain, and they are not at all afraid of being killed.\"\r\n\r\nHalf-a-dozen of these \"miserables\" were discovered\r\nafter we left one of the ports and were immediately given\r\nover to peine forte et dure.

It was kept in sorrow and in tears by the\r\nAricans. The Chilian flag waves over them, but they are,\r\nI was assured, Peruvians at heart, and intend to remain so.[*]\r\n\r\nThey did not intend to submit, but they had no officer\r\nfit to direct the defence. The crest of the Morro is\r\nfortified. I could count five embrasures, facing seawards,\r\nin the fortifications which the Peruvians constructed, supposing\r\nthey would be attacked from that direction. They\r\nhad breastworks inland from the eastward slope of the bluff,\r\nand there were also batteries or a battery lower down the\r\nhill. Three small redoubts could be made out through the\r\nglass north of the town. One of the passengers said that\r\nthe Peruvians had nine rifled guns on the Morro, three on\r\nthe work below it, and two in a redoubt--varying in calibre\r\nfrom one hundred and fifty to three hundred pounders.\r\nThere was also a floating battery covering the town seawards.\r\nAll these works were connected by electric wires.\r\nThe forts, moreover, were mined with dynamite mines,\r\nwhich could be discharged from the central bastion. The\r\ngarrison consisted of about two thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian general, Baquedano, using the railway from\r\nTacna, gathered about five thousand men at Chucalata.\r\nThe Peruvians appear to have behaved with astounding\r\nindifference to their own safety; no outposts--Arabi at\r\nTel-el-Kebir. They had been summoned to surrender\r\nthe day before--they could see the Chilians on the hills--and\r\nyet they allowed Baquedano without hindrance to\r\npush forward two thousand men under cover of night, to\r\nrush the forts and redoubts at daybreak.

When they got there it was indeed to be\r\nbetween the devil and the deep sea! The Peruvian officer\r\nin command, Bolognesi, and his second, Captain Moore, of\r\nthe Navy, did their best to rally the panic-stricken crowd.[**is that a period?]\r\nIn vain. The Peruvians were driven headlong over the\r\ncliff into the sea. The white flag was hoisted! But at\r\nthat moment the mines in the forts were fired. A cry rose\r\nfrom the Chilians, \"Spare not!\" There was a frightful\r\nmassacre! Arica was set in flames, and Baquedano reported\r\nto Santiago that evening that \"all the enemy were\r\nprisoners or slain.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to-day to read of the doings of our own\r\ncountrymen in these very seas in former times. Two\r\nhundred years ago, the delectable pirate or buccaneer,\r\nJohn Watling, who signalized his captaincy \"by ordering\r\nthe strict observance of the Sabbath in all his ships,\"\r\n\"landing at a small island named Yqueque,\" on his way\r\nto attack Arica, plundered an Indian village of provisions.\r\nThe people of Arica were then supplied with water from\r\nthe river Amerines, eleven Spanish leagues north of \"Yqueque.\"\r\nWatling examined one of the old Spaniards he had\r\ntaken at Iquique concerning the force at Arica; and,\r\n\"being offended at his answers, ordered him to be shot\"--which\r\nwas done. The attack of Watling on Arica failed.\r\nOut of his ninety-two men the Spaniards killed and took\r\ntwenty-eight, and the estimable Mr. Watling, though he\r\npractised the expedient of putting the prisoners he had\r\ntaken in front of his own men, was repulsed disastrously,\r\nand he was found by the Spaniards among the slain on the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nColonel North and most of his party went on shore to",
  "p2630.png": "lunch and see the place. It is from the river Azapa, and\r\nfrom the reservoirs on shore here, that the tanks of the\r\nwater boats to supply Pisagua and Iquique, are filled.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Colonel North, who was closely associated\r\nwith the fortunes of the town in past days, produced a\r\nconsiderable sensation in Arica. The Peruvians, who came\r\non board to welcome him, forgot their troubles for a time.\r\nThey say that they hope for better days to come, and that\r\nthey are real benefactors to Chile. Though they did not\r\nforgive their conquerors, they were fain to confess that the\r\nIntendente was a very just administrator, and that he was\r\nas good as any Chilian could be expected to be under the\r\ncircumstances. Nevertheless, if the gentlemen who visited\r\nthe ship were fair exponents of the popular will in Arica,\r\nthere could be no doubt that the province will revert to\r\nPeru by the plebiscite which is to be taken in 1893.[*]\r\n\r\nBy the treaty with Peru, which was signed provisionally\r\nin June, 1883, the Province of Tarapac\u00e1 was ceded to Chile,\r\nand Tacna and Arica were handed over to her administration\r\nfor ten years, at the expiration of which the people\r\nwere to decide by a pl\u00e9biscite[**P2: Note, other instances do mot have the accent] whether they would revert to\r\nthe Republic of Peru or remain under the flag of Chile.\r\nThe State to which they desire to adhere is to pay the other\r\nan indemnity of $10,000,000. The protocol was signed\r\nOctober 20, 1883, General Iglesias having been elected\r\nPresident of Peru and recognised by Chile, and two days\r\nlater the Chilians evacuated Lima, and Iglesias entered the\r\ncity and was installed as President.\r\n\r\nThe Cachapoal did not weigh till five o'clock at night.\r\nTo wile away the time two of our friends went off with\r\nFrank in a shore boat to get a shot at the seals and sea\r\nlions disporting themselves in the surf off a rocky island\r\n\r\n* But it is doubtful for all that. See Appendix.",
  "p2640.png": "near at hand. A little adventure, which was amusing\r\nenough to those who saw it from the deck, ensued. The\r\nCaptain of the Port, having observed the sportsmen land on\r\nthe island, sent off a cutter which bore down on their boat\r\nand carried it off with Frank and the boatman to the town.\r\nThere they were taken before the magistrate and fined\r\npretty heavily, especially the boatman, who was told he\r\nought to have known better. Meanwhile the sportsmen,\r\nhaving loosed off several rounds of musketry at the seals,\r\nand who had not observed the capture, thought they would\r\nreturn to the steamer. There was no boat to take them,\r\nand we watched them parading the beach, disconsolate, by\r\nthe sad sea wave, wondering what had happened. All our\r\nboats were on shore with the Colonel and the passengers,\r\n&c., but after an hour's wandering on the rocks in the sun\r\nthe sportsmen were released from captivity on the island to\r\nbe conducted before the authorities and fined, as Frank and\r\nthe boatman had been, for molesting creatures protected by\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nJune 9th.--Anchored off Mollendo, soon after dawn.\r\nA very heaven-forsaken looking spot, huts and sheds,\r\none or two good houses--that is, by comparison--scattered\r\nover a coast line of beetling rocks, beaten by furious surf\r\nand backed by dreary sandhills. Flags were flying from\r\nconsular offices in honour of the Sabbath day, which otherwise\r\nreceived no particular attention. Some adventurous\r\npeople went off from the ship, and I saw them, tossing up\r\nand down in their boat, with serene satisfaction. They had\r\nlittle to report when they came back. The landing-place,\r\nformed by a reef in some degree sheltering a short jetty\r\nfrom the breakers, was not inviting to a lame man.\r\n\r\nHow strange in his ways is that deity called \"Fortune.\"\r\nIt happened that the chance visit of one of these very",
  "p2650.png": "strangers saved an English lady, resident in the place,\r\nfrom utter ruin. Her husband, once worth \u00a3100,000,\r\nhad lost it all in mining ventures; he was in Iquique looking\r\nfor employment, and meantime a creditor had come\r\ndown upon his house, and was about to dispossess his\r\nwife.--\"Deus ex machina!\"--A steamer looks in--a boat\r\nputs off from her--a friend steps on shore, walks up to see\r\nthe wife of his former partner--hears the tale of distress--and\r\nat once gives the substantial relief which turns sorrow\r\ninto joy! And so we proceed in the early afternoon.\r\n\r\nJune 10th.--There is no enchantment lent to the view of\r\nChala, where the Cachapoal is at anchor this morning, by\r\ndistance. The Peruvian flag is flying proudly from a\r\nwooden shanty, and here and there are clumps of trees\r\ninside the wooden palings surrounding detached houses.\r\nSheds, bunks, bungalows, huddled together in the recesses\r\nof sandhills fenced in from the sea by rugged cliffs. Outlying\r\nbastions of rock fighting the surf; external barriers\r\nof reefs attacked by incessant rollers. The Custom House,\r\nwith a much-troubled pier, faces the sea. Some five-and-forty\r\nmiles away there were formerly great gold mines\r\npassing rich, but an earthquake destroyed the mines, burying\r\nthree hundred miners, whose remains lie engulfed there\r\nto this day. The mines have been abandoned ever since,\r\nbut I believe that Colonel North and some other gentlemen\r\nare going to work them again.\r\n\r\nHerds of cattle, driven in from the Pampas by mounted\r\nmen to the pier, where large flat-bottomed barges were\r\nholding on uneasily for their cargo, were shipped here for\r\nthe north. The beasts are caught up, slung by the horns,\r\nlifted by the crane, and swung into the flats. They are\r\npacked as close as they can stand. Then the lighters are\r\nrowed alongside--the wretched animals, with wild staring",
  "p2660.png": "eyes, lowing piteously, and trying to keep their legs in the\r\nswell. A hawser with a running noose is lowered into\r\nthe flat; the noose is slipped with a dexterous hitch, over\r\nthe horns of the nearest beast, with many a hard blow and\r\nkick, and volleys of terrible words; the donkey engine is\r\nset to work, the hawser tightens, and up comes the animal,\r\nwhich is lifted over the gunwale, with the whole weight of\r\nits body hanging from the insertion of the horns into the\r\nskull, and is dropped half lifeless on the deck. Barbarous!\r\n\"Ma che far\u00e9?\" asked an Italian.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of three or four hours, which we devoted\r\nto fishing with indifferent success, the Cachapoal weighed,\r\nand proceeded along the coast northwards. Low down\r\non the hills were layers of camanchaca as regular as\r\nstrata of masonry; above them the Andes, and distant\r\nsnow peaks. At half-past four a huge column of dark-coloured\r\nsmoke spurted out from a recess in the mountain\r\nchain, and spread out in the form of a mushroom with a\r\nslender stem above it. There was apparently a strong\r\nwind blowing, for the smoke was speedily drifted away\r\nover the sky-line. It was an outburst from some volcano.\r\nHalf an hour later, we were rewarded for our watchfulness\r\nwith the display of a similar phenomenon, but our skipper\r\ncould not \"locate\" it.\r\n\r\nJune 11th.--The sea in front of us--i.e. towards the north--presented\r\na marvellous appearance to-day; there were\r\nblack patches on the water, looking like low islands--nay,\r\nlike the solid earth itself--but they rose and fell on the\r\nheavy swell, and as the steamer approached, island after\r\nisland shattered into fragments--each a pelican! Hundreds\r\nof thousands! Probably millions! They flew like great\r\narmies towards islands on our port bow, which they covered\r\nas with mantles of feathers. The Chincha Islands which",
  "p2670.png": "yielded to Peru so many millions' worth of guano are further\r\noff. We were entering the Baccarones--a deep recess or\r\ngulf--not unlike the entrance to the Minch between Skye\r\nand the Scottish mainland--girt in on the west by rocks and\r\nislands. About an hour before we reached Pisco, a cross\r\nwith a sword on the right and some symbol on the left,\r\ndeeply cut in the soil and outlined with stones or masonry,\r\ncame into view on a sloping hill over the sea. There are\r\nlegends connected with this cross. It is said that there are\r\ngold mines of extraordinary richness in the vicinity, but\r\nattempts to work them have always been frustrated by the\r\nsudden death of the miners, and now they are abandoned.\r\nPatches of snow-white stones were visible on the hill-sides\r\nall along the coast hereabouts,\r\n\r\nPisco, with an entourage of abundant vegetation, sugar,\r\nIndian-cornfields, and gardens, houses of many colours, on\r\na plain backed by hills of moderate elevation, showed to\r\nadvantage. A long pier stretches out from the town; two\r\nchurches with towers, and domes, like mosques without\r\nminarets, give an air of importance to the place. Pisco\r\ngives its name to a spirit or liqueur, by no means to be\r\ndespised, much in favour along the coast, and the district is\r\nfamed for fruit, and for abundant and excellent grapes.\r\nWe anchored in four fathoms at two miles' distance from the\r\npier. The Peruvians made preparations to defend Pisco,\r\nbut detachments of the Chilian troops were landed, one to\r\nthe north and one to the south of the batteries, and turned\r\nthe works. We amused ourselves for some hours by fishing\r\nfrom the vessel, not with much profit; the ladies, favourites\r\nof fortune, managed to catch some pretty roach-like fish,\r\nwhich proved to be indifferent eating. We left at half-past\r\nthree in the afternoon. The rocks on the headlands of the\r\ncoast are white from deposits of guano, but the great beds",
  "p2680.png": "from which formerly fleets of ships carried the fertilizing\r\ncargoes to the Old World have been nearly exhausted.\r\nThere is little life to be seen on shore; a train of mules\r\nwas watched with the greatest interest; we have seen but\r\nthree vessels at sea since we left Iquique.\r\n\r\nJune 11th.--We have now coasted four days northwards,\r\nnever out of sight of land, generally not more than four or\r\nfive miles from it, and rarely have we had at any time a\r\nclear view of the Andes; but the sea around us is always\r\ninteresting, the infinity of sea birds and the multitudinous\r\npelican betokening a wealth of fish beyond belief. Porpoises\r\nand bonitos play about in the midst of the swarming\r\nshoals which break the water. The sharp fins of the swordfish\r\nor the shark furnish bull's-eyes, not always hit, for the\r\nidle riflemen on board.\r\n\r\nWednesday 12th.--Screwing gently since midnight\r\ntowards Callao, off which the Cachapoal came to a stand-*still\r\nat 7 A.M.

Since the war\r\nwith Chile this once busy port has lost much of its importance.\r\nIt is only on the spot that the traveller from a distant\r\nland can appreciate military operations of which he\r\nhas read, retaining probably but a confused impression of\r\nthem from telegrams and correspondents' letters. And for\r\nthe first time I am now taking an impression of the events\r\nof the campaign of 1879-81.\r\n\r\nThere are still broad and deep traces of the war\r\naround Callao. The remains of the works constructed by\r\nthe Peruvians to resist the enemy may be seen decaying\r\nand subsiding under the action of wind and rain, some\r\nleading to the enquiry suggested by the fly in amber. But",
  "p2690.png": "the measures of the conquered are viewed generally through\r\nthe spectacles of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nAfter Arica was taken the Chilian fleet blockaded Callao.\r\nThe Peruvians showed cunning as well as enterprise and\r\ncourage in torpedo hostilities in which the Chilian cruiser\r\nLoa and the historic Covadonga were destroyed. The\r\nChilians retaliated by bombarding Callao. But the situation\r\nmight have lasted much longer had not Lynch's expedition,\r\nlanding at Chimbote, marched inland, captured a\r\ngreat quantity of warlike stores at Supe, and then embarking\r\nlanded again at Paita and there enforced the counsels of\r\nthose who were anxious to persuade Peru to come to terms\r\nwith her victorious enemy ere it was too late, by demonstrating\r\nher inability to resist invasion.\r\n\r\nWithout offering an opinion on the rights and the\r\nwrongs of the war between the Republics, I must express\r\nmy regret that Peru did not recognise the impolicy and\r\ndanger of rejecting the chance of compromise which was\r\noffered at the conference at Arica. Lynch had been wasting\r\nthe coast, levying contributions, and destroying property,\r\nwithout a show of opposition, for two months, in\r\nexpeditions which he conducted with singular energy,\r\nskill, and enterprise, and with uniform success. \"Don\r\nPatricio,\" who was educated in the British or Anglo-Indian\r\nnavy, and was a captain in the Chilian service, displayed\r\nextraordinary capacity as a military leader and as a civil\r\nadministrator. He rightly considered that the most efficacious\r\nway of injuring an enemy was to destroy his material\r\nresources and to shake his moral courage. He was both\r\nhumane and just, but he maintained order and discipline\r\nwith an iron hand, and the memory of the gallant Irishman\r\nis held in respect all over Chile. Don Patricio Lynch was\r\nappointed Minister to Madrid--it was hinted to remove him",
  "p2700.png": "from evidence--after the war, and died at sea on his way\r\nback from Spain after the war.\r\n\r\nChile had nearly 27,000 men at Tacna, Arica, Iquique,\r\nand Antofagasta, with a reserve of 10,000, so that Baquedano\r\nhad more than 40,000 men ready to take the field the\r\nmoment negotiations were broken off. In less than three\r\nweeks from the refusal of the allies to agree to terms\r\nBaquedano led an expedition to the coast of Peru, and\r\nlanded two divisions with which he commenced his march\r\ntowards Lima. The Peruvians had collected about 25,000\r\nmen for active service. It seems incredible that with such\r\na force they should have allowed the Chilians to remain\r\nunmolested after their first landing at Curayaco, where\r\nthey were exposed to an overwhelming force and could have\r\nbeen driven into the sea if attacked at once. Pierola relied\r\nupon forts and fortifications and the long line of trenches\r\nby which the commanding positions outside Lima were\r\ndefended. And indeed it was with some reason he trusted\r\nin them, for it was not till after a long-continued and most\r\ndesperate action at Chorrillos that the Chilians carried the\r\nworks and became masters of the capital and of the Republic.\r\nTheir loss was upwards of 3,300 killed and\r\nwounded. More than 5,000 Peruvians lay dead on the\r\nfield and in the villages, and the Chilians took upwards\r\nof 2,000 prisoners and 120 guns.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this crushing disaster reached Lima,\r\nto convert the exultation aroused by lying telegrams from\r\nthe field into dismay, a mob, composed of the villainy and\r\nrascality of a hybrid population, and of the soldiery who\r\nsought refuge from the battlefield in the city, arose for the\r\nwork of plunder and murder, and revelled in both. The\r\nforeign residents in the capital and in Callao turned out to\r\ndefend their lives and property, and showed a firm front to",
  "p2710.png": "the gangs of plunderers, which no doubt averted great\r\nmisfortunes. It is a curious proof of the force of what is\r\ncalled \"nationality\" that in such a supreme moment the\r\nfriends of order grouped themselves as separate little corps\r\nas French, Spanish, Swiss, English, Americans, &c., and\r\nacted independently. Mr. Milne, acting with his own\r\ncountrymen, told me he had the satisfaction of inflicting\r\ncondign punishment on some of the robbers who were\r\nengaged in sacking the houses.\r\n\r\nCallao, but a few years ago one of the most frequented\r\nports in the world, is to-day a melancholy waste of waters.\r\nThe wrecks of the ships, which the Peruvians sank rather\r\nthan surrender them to the Chilians, lay stark and stiff in-*shore.\r\nThe only vessels in harbour were a few coasting\r\nand ocean steamers, merchantmen, and a couple of small\r\ncraft, which could scarcely be denominated vessels of war,\r\nflying the Peruvian flag. The magnificent docks, the work\r\nof the late Mr. Brassey, are almost untenanted, and the\r\nbusiest thing about them is a seal, apparently an habitu\u00e9\r\nand privileged denizen, as it swam and fished at the entrance,\r\nquite close to the steamer. We drove to the house\r\nof Mr. Milne, a representative Aberdonian, in one of the\r\nsuburbs of Callao called Punta (the Point), and were luxuriously\r\nentertained at the hotel as a preliminary to a visit\r\nto the extensive and well-organized flour-mills owned by\r\nour host. Lord Donoughmore, rejoicing in the success of\r\nhis negotiations, met us at Mr. Milne's house, and did his\r\nutmost to contribute to the interest and amusement to be\r\nderived from our visit for the short time we were in Peru.\r\nLady Donoughmore, who had been living in a villa close to\r\nMr. Milne's house in the shingly suburb, \"by the sad sea\r\nwave,\" had gone home a short time before our arrival.\r\n\r\nThe outlying streets of Callao are not savoury or",
  "p2720.png": "picturesque, nor is the formation of the ground, however\r\ninteresting to the geologist, attractive to the ordinary\r\ntraveller. The sea beaches here are accounted \"the most\r\ninstructive\" in the world, but it needs knowledge and\r\npersonal investigation to derive benefit from a study of\r\ntheir peculiarities. On our way through the streets,\r\nwhich perhaps it would be as unfair to take as specimens\r\nof Callao, as it would be to estimate London from a drive\r\nthrough Whitechapel or Wapping, we disturbed at every\r\nthree or four yards groups of the gallinazos, or horrible\r\nlittle vultures, which act as public scavengers, none of\r\nwhich we had seen in Chile.\r\n\r\nThe evening of our arrival at Lima, where we put up at\r\na most comfortable hotel--De France et d'Angleterre--was\r\ndevoted to various excursions--to the Plaza de Armas where\r\nstands the Government House--to churches, of which most\r\nwere shut, and to strolls about the streets and arcades. As\r\none of the principal reasons which actuate Englishmen to\r\ngo far abroad appears to be the business of arranging for\r\na cricket-match, the preliminaries for a friendly encounter\r\nbetween the travellers in the Cachapoal and the British\r\nresidents in Lima were arranged for the next day. I am\r\nnot ashamed to admit that I think scratch cricket in\r\none place is very like the same game in another. Campos\r\nnon animum mutant, &c. So my wife and I set out\r\nwith an intelligent Peruvian gentleman to inspect the\r\nchurches, the Public Library, and the gardens which had\r\nbeen recently the scene of the Great Exhibition of this\r\npart of the world. At the Cathedral--I am not quite sure\r\nI am right in designating the massive building, where\r\nthe bones of Pizarro were laid, by this name--our guide\r\nwas refused permission, generally accorded, to view the\r\nrelics of the conqueror, on the ground that the archbishop",
  "p2730.png": "had locked them up and put the key in his pocket. The\r\nverger gave as a reason for this precautionary measure, that\r\nforeigners, particularly Americans, were in the habit of\r\nabstracting Pizarro's toe, and finger, bones, &c. There is\r\nreason to suspect that much of the \"remains\" on show\r\nnever belonged to the \"conquistador,\" the impress of\r\nwhose finger in lieu of a signature on the contract he\r\nsigned with his colleague for a division of power is still\r\nextant.\r\n\r\nOur very brief stay at Lima enabled us to see just enough\r\nof the city to accentuate our regret that we could not devote\r\nmore time to the most interesting place we saw in South\r\nAmerica. There is an air of decayed greatness about the\r\npublic buildings and the houses eminently respectable, if\r\nnot satisfactory from a commercial or industrial point of\r\nview. There are many reminiscences of old Spain, tokens of\r\nthe days when the Viceroy of Peru was the potential\r\nrepresentative of one of the greatest empires in the world.\r\nThe creation of great vice-royalties in Mexico, Grenada,\r\nVenezuela, &c., and the organized disorder in the Central\r\nAmerican States, greatly diminished the prestige and power\r\nof the Court of Spain. As England was unable to overcome\r\nthe revolutionary outburst of the American colonies, Spain\r\nwas totally impotent, in the early part of the present\r\ncentury, to master the insurrection which destroyed her\r\ncontrol of the vast regions which extend from Panama to\r\nPatagonia.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable difference as regards appearance,\r\ndress, and bearing, between the population of Santiago and\r\nof Lima. There are more Indian-looking people in the\r\nlatter than in the former city. They are smaller, less robust\r\nin body, but, I will not add, less prepossessing in aspect\r\nand manners; and the Peruvian ladies we saw in the",
  "p2740.png": "capital were possessed of personal attractions which were\r\nby no means common in the south.\r\n\r\nThe Library of the University and Museo contains a\r\nseries of portraits of the viceroys and Presidents of Peru,\r\nas well as some good specimens of Merino, the only South\r\nAmerican artist who acquired a reputation in Europe, or\r\nrather in France, where he lived and died. I had the good\r\nfortune, at the Museum, to make the acquaintance of Professor\r\nPalma, whom I found in a waste of books. There\r\nwere thousands on the floor awaiting arrangement, and\r\ndestined apparently to give considerable trouble before they\r\ncould be put in order. Many of these belonged to the suppressed\r\nreligious houses. They lay in rank and file, and\r\ncolumn, monuments of forgotten learning, cased in their\r\nsheepskin clothing--dissertations upon the Fathers, controversial\r\nworks in Latin and Spanish--representing the\r\naggregate work of hundreds of years of wasted labour.\r\nProf. Palma is well known in Europe as a writer of the\r\nadvanced liberal school. I gathered from his remarks that\r\nhe did not take the least interest in the heaps of learned\r\nrubbish that lay around him, and that he had no veneration\r\nfor purely academic learning.\r\n\r\nA drive to the Public Gardens, which are filled with\r\ncharming exotics, brought our excursion to a close. On our\r\nway back we drew up to look at a battalion of infantry at\r\nexercise in the square outside the gardens. I protest that\r\nno one could detect any difference in size, uniform, or drill\r\nbetween the Peruvian and French infantry. They were\r\ndressed, turned out, and armed exactly like a French battalion\r\nof the line, and as the Chilian soldiery affect the\r\nsame approximation to the military attire of our lively\r\nneighbours it would be difficult to prevent mistakes, if\r\nthere were another war between Chile and Peru. A",
  "p2750.png": "detachment of a regiment coming out of the courtyard of\r\nthe President's palace had the same uniform as the battalion\r\nat drill near the gardens, so I presume the Peruvian army is\r\nquite Gallicized. The President, General Caceres, owes\r\nhis election to the gallantry he displayed at the ill-fated\r\nbattle of Chorrillos, and sits firmly in his chair it is said\r\nbecause he has the support of the army. He is gifted with\r\npersonal intrepidity, common sense, and moderation. The\r\npersonal purity in nominations to office and in the distribution\r\nof the patronage of the State which is ascribed\r\nto him does not, it is said, belong to those whose influence\r\nis very considerable, very near his person.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Mansfield entertained us and some friends\r\nat dinner. I learned a great deal of interesting facts,\r\nwhich a far longer stay under less favourable auspices\r\ncould not have afforded me.\r\n\r\nNext day we started by special train to take a run along\r\nthe railway, but the destruction of the great Oroya bridge\r\nand viaduct prevented our ascent to the commanding altitude\r\nwhich previous travellers generally attained, and we\r\ndid not go beyond San Bartolom\u00e9. The railway, following\r\nupwards the course of the valley through which the sacred\r\nRimac descends to the sea, passes by the battle-field of\r\nChorrillos. But the scenery is not grand, and the snow\r\npeaks are generally hidden from view. On the low grounds\r\nIndian villages, or the remains of them, tropical vegetation,\r\ntroops of llamas plodding along the tracks; sugar plantations,\r\nsome few good country houses standing in fields,\r\nhills crowned with forts--then a dejeuner at Chosi\u00e7a, a\r\nfavourite station on the line, and so on to San Bartolom\u00e9--that\r\nwas all we saw and did. It had been arranged that\r\nthere was to be a bull-fight next day, and a famous bull-fighter--brother,\r\nindeed, of the great Frascuelo, one of the",
  "p2760.png": "master swordsmen of Spain--was engaged; the plaza was\r\nready, the band was hired for a ball to follow. But these\r\nplans were suddenly abandoned because the captain of the\r\nsteamer received orders to leave that night, and from San\r\nBartolom\u00e9 we proceeded straight to Callao, without stopping\r\nat Lima, and started at sunset that evening in the Cachapoal\r\nfor Panama.\r\n\r\nJune 15th.--The mercury is rising rapidly in the thermometer.\r\n85\u00b0 to-day, so the awnings afford a grateful\r\nshelter from the sun. At noon a grand snow-clad peak\r\nwas visible towering above the Andes, which recede from\r\nthe coast as we approach Salaverry, and by calculation the\r\ncone was made out to be ninety or one hundred miles distant.\r\nPassing the Guano Islands at 1 P.M., sea smooth as\r\nglass, anchored for a few hours off the decayed little port\r\nof Salaverry, its former importance indicated by a fine pier\r\nand great resources for loading and unloading in the form\r\nof an array of lighters of unusual dimensions. All hands\r\nfishing. Miss North excited the envy of the anglers by\r\ncapturing a fine Corbino, which could only be got on deck\r\nby the adroit use of a big basket as a landing-net. As the\r\nCachapoal was leaving her anchorage she disconcerted an\r\nenormous turtle that seemed to have been asleep in alderman\r\nfashion on its back, and which was very nearly run down.\r\n\r\nJune 16th.--Very like the day before; looked in at\r\nanother port--Paita, where Lynch operated--and found\r\nthe United States steamer Mohican, a very venerable craft,\r\nflying the stars and stripes, \"forgotten by the navy department,\"\r\nit was said. One of the ships at anchor had a\r\nvery curious colour. It was the result of the gas called\r\nthe \"Painter\" or \"Callao Barber,\" which turns white\r\npaint quite black in a night. It turns into dust when dry,\r\nand the black coating is then easily removed. The gas comes",
  "p2770.png": "from the bed of the sea, some sulphurous emanation from\r\nsubterranean fires. Had an interesting talk now and then\r\nwith one of the passengers, an English sea captain named\r\nWhateley, an old Isle of Wight yachtsman who commanded\r\na transport during the war. Grau, whose real name was\r\nMagrath, could have wrought tremendous mischief if he\r\nhad acted with energy when the Huascar was mistress of\r\nthe seas. He could have gone to Antofagasta, destroyed\r\nthe transports there with 5,000 Chilians on board, and\r\nthen left the troops (10,000) to capitulate or die for want\r\nof water by breaking the condensers. The heat is tropical,\r\nand mosquitoes are coming off the land to visit us. \"Yes,\r\nsir, it's a fixed fact that at Guayaquil and places like that\r\nthe donkeys and horses wear trousers! The skeeters would\r\ndrive 'em mad if they didn't.\" I doubted, but it was true.\r\nThe Cachapoal entered the Guayaquil River at dawn on\r\nJune 17, and threaded the muddy stream for eight hours till\r\nshe reached her moorings off the city. The banks of the\r\nriver are most picturesque. They are bordered with hills\r\nclothed in the most luxuriant vegetation, or by forests of\r\nnoble trees. Here and there, there are vistas of cultivated\r\nlands and fields, with herds of cattle and droves of horses.\r\nThe stream is in places six or eight miles broad. Took in\r\npilot at Puna at 8.30. The river needs knowledge, and\r\nour courses were narrow and devious--now to the right\r\nand now to the left bank, now mid-stream, and now zigzag.\r\nAnd down the turbid current came a procession of floating\r\nweed islands, rich with water lilies and flowering shrubs,\r\nfloating down to die in the salt sea--some but a few yards\r\nround, others almost as large as Thames eyots--and\r\ntroubling vessels at anchor and small craft with their attentions,\r\nbut the boatmen are expert in getting rid of these\r\ninterminable assailants, and when their craft are quite",
  "p2780.png": "enveloped they work their way out to one side or the other\r\nof the island as they float down with it, and then resume\r\ntheir course. The river is rich also in alligators, and sanguine\r\nexpectations of sport animated the breasts of the\r\nowners of rifles and youthful spirits till the Cachapoal\r\nanchored off the town, and the native boatmen gave expression\r\nto their views on the tariff for the hire of a four-oar\r\nup the creek, where alligators are plentiful as swans at\r\nChiswick, when it became evident that an expedition of\r\nthe kind demanded the resources of Cr\u0153sus. The city\r\nlooked very well from the river; the long quay was lined\r\nby steamers and sailing vessels--Norwegian, Danish,\r\nFrench, American--a long way from home, and between it\r\nand the street of lofty houses, with many-coloured fronts\r\nand gay Venetians, tram-cars plied busily. The Ecuador\r\ntricolour--yellow, black, and red--floated from the public\r\nbuildings on shore and from a small man-of-war and a torpedo\r\nboat in the stream, and church spires rose above\r\nthe house-tops, and on the quays there was incessant\r\nmovement of carts and waggons. Large barges filled with\r\ncargo lay alongside the vessels in the stream, and an infinite\r\nvariety of boats, all with canopies or awnings, dug-outs,\r\ncanoes, &c., were busy on the water. The houses near\r\nthe banks below the city are built on piles or framework,\r\nthe dwelling-rooms being on the first floor and the second\r\nstory. The women are as dark as Egyptians, and resemble\r\nthem closely in dress. We lay in the stream till six\r\no'clock taking in and discharging cargo. A Swedish\r\nengineer, who has a scheme for supplying the city with\r\nwater by laying pipes in the bed of the river to it from a\r\nsmall island where there is a marvellous series of wells, is\r\nenthusiastic about the wealth and greatness of Ecuador in\r\nthe near future.

But there are not half as many\r\npeople in the Republic as there are in Paris, and there is a\r\nrespectable public debt, and there are--earthquakes. When\r\nthey happen there can be no mistake about them, but it is\r\nnearly fifty years ago since Quito was simply shaken to\r\npieces, and the people await the next visitation with perfect\r\ntranquillity. A column of skirmishing mosquitoes came off\r\nas the sun declined, and soon made us aware that they\r\nmeant business. At the same time it was hot and stuffy\r\nunder the awnings, and the thermometer marked 90\u00b0, when\r\nthe sun took a header, and darkness at once set in. The\r\npilot took the ship down the river in the dark, but there\r\nwere men in the chains heaving the lead all the way, and\r\nsometimes they made startling announcements, but the\r\npilot never minded them. \"By the mark thr-r-r-ree!\"\r\nsung out Jack.

Passed Puna\r\nand out to sea at night.\r\n\r\nJune 18th.--At 7.30 A.M. passed an island with a cairn\r\non the top. Land very indistinct. Two little birds like\r\nEnglish linnets came on board, and snow-white birds, like\r\nsmall Soland geese, are skimming the sea and soaring with\r\nimmense power of pinion.

At 10 A.M.\r\nCotopaxi showed its snowy front high up in the heavens,\r\nbut all the range below was invisible.

How the burly engineer became a\r\ncentre of attraction as he \"came up to blow\" on deck, and\r\nsaid evil things of one of his boilers! But he had the\r\nair of a conqueror--a modest one--and he was justified, for\r\nat 5 P.M. we passed the Pizarro, which gave us a berth\r\nthree miles wide. Next morning the Britisher was some\r\nmiles astern, but at 8.50 a \"biler tube\" gave way! Then\r\nwe had but three boilers, and as Panama was approached\r\nPizarro came creeping up, but Cachapoal made a supreme\r\neffort, and got away once more.

  "p2820.png": "\r\nThe Cachapoal anchored in the beautiful bay outside\r\nPanama at 2 P.M. on Thursday, 20th of June, and as the\r\nsteamer for New York did not leave till the following\r\nMonday, Capt. Chase, to reduce the risk of catching the\r\nfever to a minimum, kindly allowed us to remain on board\r\ntill his return passengers came off. There was a magnificent\r\nthunderstorm raging on shore. An ink-black pall from the\r\nheavens covered one-half of the hills which rise steeply\r\nbehind the picturesque old city, whence incessant flashes of\r\nlightning seemed to strike the summits, and the roar and\r\necho of thunder claps and peals were incessant. On the\r\nother half of the city the sun shone brightly, lighting up\r\nin its own way the sheets of rain which fell in veritable\r\nwaterspouts. The venerable Cathedral, the churches, the\r\nancient bastioned walls, were set in sheets of flame with an\r\nebony background. Near at hand the sea was smooth as\r\nglass, and the green of the vegetation and trees on the\r\nisland close at hand was so fresh and bright that it was not\r\neasy to believe the air around us was infected. The harbour\r\nhad a desolate air. There were pour tout potage the steamer\r\nfor 'Frisco and another American, two P.S.N. steamers, and\r\nour friend Pizarro and a few small craft--a great change\r\nsince I last saw it. The report of those who went on shore,\r\nrather a tedious matter at low water, as the channel is very\r\nlong and narrow and there is very little to spare between\r\nthe bottom and the keel of an ordinary cutter, made us very\r\nwell pleased that we had not to leave our cabins and very\r\nthankful to the Captain for his indulgence. Next morning\r\nthe tender came alongside at the top of the tide to take\r\noff the heavy baggage and those passengers who wished\r\nto leave for Colon, &c. A negro \"curio\" dealer tripped on\r\nboard intent on trade. The American near at hand had\r\nhauled his ensign down half-mast. \"What is that for?\"",
  "p2830.png": "\"The purser he pison his self, sah! He bad man, sah!\r\nKill himself! He go to hell for sure, sah! Bad man! He\r\ncheat me, sah!\" And he told us how \"the Queen of\r\nEngland! God bless her! Amen! She send of de men-of-war\r\nand de steamers to take away de poor black chaps--twenty-five\r\ntousand dere was!--to their own country\r\nwhen de canal stop.\" And then he said evil things of the\r\ncanal. The tender brought also some of the passengers\r\nwho were to go south in the Cachapoal, among whom\r\nwas Mr. Patrick Egan, United States Minister to Chile,\r\nwho became my \"next door neighbour,\" that is, he\r\noccupied the cabin beside mine on the saloon deck; but I\r\nwas not aware of the fact till I saw a pile of luggage, very\r\nfresh and new, on the deck, with the name and designation\r\nof the owner upon them, outside his door, and I certainly\r\ncould not have supposed that the pale, thoughtful, student-like\r\nlooking little man, with sloping narrow shoulders and\r\nfeeble frame, who was seated near me, was the pitiless\r\nconspirator to whose door is laid one of the most terrible\r\ncrimes of modern times. He had been some time on shore,\r\nawaiting the arrival of a vessel under the Chilian flag, and\r\nhe had paid the penalty of his national scruples, for he\r\ncame on board very much worn in consequence of an attack\r\nof one of the Panama endemics. \"Perhaps he would rather\r\nbe ill on board a Chilian steamer than in good health on\r\nboard a vessel flying the British ensign?\" I do not think\r\nso. I became acquainted with Mr. Egan by accident--curious\r\nenough in its way--and had a long and to me\r\ninteresting conversation in virtue of it, in which the\r\nMinister spoke of my old friend (and his) Isaac Butt, of\r\nthe Greville election, of King-Harman, who was carried, he\r\naverred, on Carey's back down Sackville Street at the time,\r\nand of Pigott (the news of whose death had not long been",
  "p2840.png": "known here), and of matters relating to the accusations\r\nagainst him. When I came back to my party after that\r\nconversation I perceived that I was regarded with the same\r\nfeelings as little Florentine children had for Dante--only\r\ndeeper, perhaps. He had only seen Hell--I had been there\r\nand talked en ami with the Evil One! Mr. Egan did not\r\nappear at meals. Had he done so Captain Chase would\r\nhave had to put him in the seat of honour next himself.\r\n\r\nWe left the Cachapoul on Saturday forenoon, June 22nd,\r\nand drove to the Grand Central Hotel facing the Cathedral,\r\nand the rest of the day and the Sunday following were\r\nspent quietly on shore in the quaint old Spanish town\r\nwhich played such an important part in the days of the\r\nbuccaneers.\r\n\r\nOur windows looked out on the square. Early on Sunday\r\nthere was a function at the Cathedral which attracted\r\nthe feminine rank and fashion of the place. A constant\r\nstream of well-dressed ladies, well-bonneted, gloved, and\r\nbooted, with fine fans and elaborate sunshades, trooped into\r\nthe sacred edifice. Now and then a dandy, old or young,\r\nascended the steps, but the mass of the worshippers were\r\nvery dark indeed, and many were altogether African. Presently,\r\nto the strains of the organ pealing through the open\r\ndoors, was joined the blare of brazen instruments, and a\r\nmilitary band came down the street, heading a couple of\r\ncompanies of very smart and showily-dressed infantry of\r\nthe garrison, marching au pas with fixed bayonets, to mass.\r\nThey entered the Cathedral with their arms, in order, and\r\nsoon the organ and the band united in a fine Jubilate Deo,\r\nwhich was hushed as the tinkle of a bell was heard, and\r\nthe people in the square were silent, knelt, and crossed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious sight. It seems that as regards the",
  "p2850.png": "soldiers, it is not considered safe to let them go to church\r\nwithout their arms and store of ball cartridge, for the conspirators,\r\npatriots, professors of barricades, et hoc genus\r\nomne, of whom there is good store ever hereabouts,\r\ngenerally select the Sabbath for a pronunciamiento--the\r\nbetter the day the better the deed. I paid a visit to Mr.\r\nLeay, the acting Consul, for whom every one who needs\r\nhelp or advice has only one word of praise, and I looked\r\nout from his window on the church (another) and buildings\r\nof a square, which had been the scene of serious fighting in\r\nthe last rising, the British Consulate having its full share\r\nof bullet marks. The new order of things will, it is hoped\r\nand believed, be more peaceful, as a confederation is not so\r\nmuch given to eruption, as a separate state, in Central\r\nAmerica. I was very anxious to look at the Canal works\r\nnear at hand, but I did not find any eager offers to go with\r\nme. It is certainly very hot in the day time just now,\r\nand it is not safe to be out after dark, at this time of\r\nthe year, near the water. And here was I much vexed\r\nthat an inebriated and enthusiastic sporting skipper, who\r\npromised us a launch to take us to good alligator coverts\r\nin the early morning, had not kept or had forgotten his\r\nword!\r\n\r\nThe American landlord of the Grand Central Hotel,\r\nwhere we lodged, laughed to scorn the idea that Panama\r\nwas an unhealthy place. \"Look at me!\" he said, \"and\r\nlook at my family!\" And they were indeed most creditable\r\ntestimonials! I confess, that but for a speedy and\r\nsharp experience I should not have believed the stories we\r\nwere told of the mortal unhealthiness of the Isthmus. True,\r\nthat in an excursion we made to the mouth of the Panama\r\nCanal, we saw on either side of us, a long road lined with\r\nmagnificent trees, many vast cemeteries--with legions of",
  "p2860.png": "crosses and stone and wooden pillars--but the air was\r\npure and there seemed no taint of fever in it.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I got out of the carriage and walked down\r\nto the shore, when we were near the sea, through one of\r\nthe small navy yards, as they might be termed, where some\r\nof the launches and boats of the Canal Company were drawn\r\nup on the beach. We had not been there above a few\r\nmoments when one of the French employ\u00e9s in the yard called\r\nout to us to \"come back from the edge of the water as the\r\nsun was getting low and it was dangerous.\" So we drove\r\nback to our hotel and thought no more about it. I shall\r\nnot repeat any of the tales of woe and the complaints anent\r\nthe Panama Canal and its management, but I may summarize\r\nthe substance of them in the remark that if they\r\nwere true the work might have been and should have been\r\ncompleted for the money actually expended up to that\r\ntime upon it. I had seen the early days of the Suez Canal\r\nwhen it was derided as a ridiculous impossible project, and\r\nI had passed through it on the day of the inauguration,\r\nwhen it was hailed as the accomplishment of one of the\r\ngrandest ideas that had ever entered the mind of man, and\r\nwhen I said so, my friend replied, \"Yes! But then de\r\nLesseps was in his prime! He is no longer able to inspire,\r\ndirect, and order, and his lieutenants were corrupt or incompetent.\"\r\n\r\nNext day, June 24th, Colonel North, to save an early\r\nstart and long journey, engaged for \u00a350 a special train\r\nwhich ran over the rail from Panama to Colon in less than\r\ntwo hours. What I saw on the way even from the windows\r\nof a special train filled me with regret that so many lives\r\nand so much money should be sacrificed in vain, should the\r\nwork be abandoned. Nor could I, nor can I, understand\r\nwhy it should be. It is evident that every year will add",
  "p2870.png": "to the cost of reclearance and reconstruction of the work\r\nthat has been executed. The ch\u00e2lets, cottages, and workmen's\r\nvillages at the stations, so well-designed and constructed,\r\nare in the occupation of negro squatters, who\r\nchatter like monkeys from their vegetable gardens at the\r\npassing train. The hotels are closed or occupied as drinking\r\ndens, and the masterpieces of mechanical science left by\r\nthe sides of the cuttings are covered over with creepers\r\nand tropical vegetation, so that the elevateurs look like\r\ngigantic orchids. Nevertheless, having heard so much of\r\nthe smallness of the results of a prodigious outlay, I confess\r\nI was astonished to find that so much had been done. But\r\nthat was from the window of a special train!\r\n\r\nWe embarked in the Newport at once, and left Colon or\r\nAspinwall at 5 o'clock in the evening, arriving off the\r\nQuarantine Station in New York on the night of July 1st,\r\ntoo late to land. The master of our steamer (one of the Jay\r\nGould line in connection with the Panama Railway Co.)\r\nwas \"a remarkable man\" from the point of view which\r\ntook him in as a sailor. He wore a white neckcloth like\r\na parson, and affected the staid deportment of an ecclesiastic,\r\nbut his real forte lay in dealing with states and\r\nstatesmen, for he was by inclination what he called a\r\n\"die-plomatist,\" and he certainly made himself universally\r\ndisliked on board his ship. He seemed quite glad to arrive\r\nlate, and to let us know he could have got in much earlier\r\nhad he pleased. Cucullus non facit monachum--the white\r\ntie did not make the Captain amiable. Two days after we\r\nleft Colon my wife became unwell. Dr. Stubbert, the\r\nsurgeon of the ship, well-accustomed to read the symptoms\r\nof the malady, announced that she was suffering from\r\nPanama fever. So it was that walk of a few minutes by\r\nthe Canal that had done the work. The fever increased",

It was a great disappointment\r\nto her to learn, and indeed to feel, that on\r\narriving, instead of being able to continue our journey with\r\nthose friends in whose society we had travelled so many\r\nthousands of miles so pleasantly, we should have to part\r\ncompany under circumstances of great anxiety and distress.\r\nThe party, which was joined in New York by the wife,\r\nbrother, and son of Colonel North, and several friends\r\nfrom England, broke up to our great regret.

The geologists assert that there has\r\nbeen a change of climate in Northern Chile, and that there\r\nmust have been more rain there \"formerly\"--that geologically\r\nmeans, much, or any, time--than there is at present.\r\nTraces of human habitations are found high up in the Cordilleras\r\nto-day. Cobs of Indian corn, axes, and knives of\r\ncopper tempered to exceeding sharpness, arrowheads of\r\nagate, even pieces of cloth, are dug up, in arid plains, now\r\nwithout any trace of water for many leagues in or around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow, if there was a change of climate, as Darwin seems\r\ndisposed to infer, and if rain fell in this region, how is it\r\nthat these nitrate beds were not liquefied and that the\r\nbasins were not then converted into salt lakes like those\r\nexisting in Patagonia?\r\n\r\nThe ways of this Continent of South America in the\r\ndays when the world was young may be discussed scholastically\r\nor hypothetically. But they cannot be reduced\r\nto dogmatic certainty. Therefore, if those who contend\r\nthat the Nitrate fields are the beds of salt-water lakes\r\nwhich were cut off from the sea by volcanic eruptions, so\r\nthat the sea-water simmered down in the course of ages,\r\nevolving Carbonic Acid Gas which converted the salt\r\n(Chloride of Sodium) into Carbonate of Sodium, which\r\nammoniated by the action of guano became Nitrate of Soda,\r\nare asked for proofs of their contention, they may reply\r\nby the question, \"Why not? our doctrine is as good as\r\nany other.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Castle says:--\"Raw nitrate of soda, spoken of as\r\ncaliche, is only found on the south-west coast of America, between\r\nthe parallels of 20\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 south latitude; it is invariably\r\nsituated in beds of not less than 2,000 feet above",

It is a mineral deposit, formed\r\nchiefly, it is believed, by decayed animal vegetation, seaweed\r\nmatter, mingled with sea salts. This theory is borne\r\nout in some measure by the fact that skins, also skeletons\r\nof animals, birds, shells, sea-birds' eggs, fish, feathers, and\r\nguano, are found constantly under the caliche, some fifteen\r\nfeet below the surface. Mr. Watters, of the 'Aurora'\r\noficina, has some most interesting specimens; the presence\r\nof iodine, as iodate of soda, also points to this theory. The\r\nbest deposits are found on the border of Tamarugal Pampa\r\nin the province of Tarapac\u00e1, and contain some forty to\r\nfifty per cent. of raw nitrate, while those on the Atacama\r\ndesert are more extensive, but less rich, containing only\r\nabout thirty-three per cent. of the same material.\"\r\n\r\nMr. David Forbes, in his elaborate disquisition on the\r\ngeology of Bolivia and Peru, which appears in the \"Quarterly\r\nJournal,\" of the Geological Society, vol. xvii.,\r\nFebruary, 1861, gives a more detailed account:--\"Later in\r\nage than the Tertiary deposits, the saline formations so\r\ncharacteristic of this part of South America are not, as frequently\r\nsupposed, more confined to the country surrounding\r\nthe port of Iquique, but appear at intervals scattered\r\nover the whole of that portion of the western coast on\r\nwhich no rain falls; whilst to the south they run entirely\r\nthrough the desert of Atacama, and even show signs of their\r\nexistence further south than Copiapo, in Chile, thus stretching\r\nmore than 550 miles north and south; their greatest\r\ndevelopment appears, however, between latitudes 19\u00b0 and\r\n25\u00b0 south. They are generally superficial, but occasion-*",

When studying the structure of the",
  "p2930.png": "mountain ranges near the coast, it was observed that, at all\r\nthe large saline deposits, the chain of hills to the westward\r\nor sea side of the 'salinas' is of such a formation as\r\nmight on elevation be expected to enclose a series of\r\nlagoons, which, by means of the breaks or lateral openings\r\nin the chain itself, could for a longer or shorter period\r\nkeep up a tidal or occasional communication with the sea\r\nwhen high, which thus would pour in a fresh supply of\r\nsalt water to make up for the loss sustained in the lagoons\r\nfrom the evaporation produced by the heat of a tropical\r\nsun. It is therefore not necessary to suppose that the\r\ngreat amount of saline matter generally present in these\r\ndeposits is due to the salts contained in an amount of sea-water\r\nmerely equal to the quantity originally contained in\r\nthe lagoon, or, in other words, to the cubical contents\r\nof the lagoons themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The occurrence of salt at different places along the coast\r\nat very small elevations above the sea, previously noticed,\r\nis no doubt due merely to the tidal infiltration of sea-water\r\ninto the porous shingle and other beds, and its subsequent\r\nevaporation, and must not be confounded with the much\r\ngreater and more elevated saline deposits further inland,\r\nwhich are met with at three very different altitudes above\r\nthe sea, and which appear to indicate three distinct and\r\nimportant changes in level in this part of South America.\r\nThe deposits, situated at about 2,500 to 3,500 feet above\r\nthe present sea-level, include the important beds of nitrate\r\nof soda so extensively worked along this coast, and appear\r\nto run from latitude 19\u00b0 southward into the northern\r\npart of the desert of Atacama, showing themselves, according\r\nto the configuration of the country, at distances varying\r\nfrom ten to forty miles inland.\r\n\r\n\"All the data that I could obtain appeared fully to confirm",
  "p2940.png": "the 'lagoon hypothesis' previously mentioned, and to\r\nprove that the original constituents of these beds had\r\nmerely been such salts as would result from the evaporation\r\nof sea-water. The nitrate of soda and some other associated\r\ncompounds are due to subsequent reactions and\r\nconsequent decomposition of the salt of the original deposit,\r\nmainly produced by the agency of carbonate of lime and\r\ndecomposing vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n\"The first step in the formation of nitrate of soda appears\r\nto be the decomposition of the chloride of sodium, or salt,\r\nby carbonate of lime (in the form of shell-sand, &c.) with\r\nthe production of chloride of calcium and carbonate of soda,\r\nboth of which salts have been shown to be present in\r\nquantity in the soil of these nitrate grounds.\r\n\r\n\"The carbonate of soda thus eliminated, when in contact\r\nwith the mixture of shell-sand and decomposing vegetable\r\nmatter which may be expected to result from the luxuriant\r\nvegetation around such a tropical swamp, and from the\r\nabundant marine plants in the lagoon itself, would realise\r\nthe conditions of the French artificial nitre-beds, substituting\r\nonly carbonate of soda for the carbonate of potash\r\nthere used. We may consequently, with all fairness,\r\nexpect a similar result in the production of nitrate of soda\r\non a still larger scale.\r\n\r\n\"This view appears much strengthened by the occurrence\r\nof wood, reeds, or rushes, and other vegetable matter in\r\nthe nitre-grounds at but little below the surface, as well as\r\nfrom the general position of the nitrate of soda in the\r\nsaline deposit, as it invariably occurs in the margin or\r\nouter edge of these, representing the shelving sides of the\r\nhollow or lagoon-basin, the central part of which is composed\r\nof layers of sea-salt only, frequently several feet in\r\nthickness.",
  "p2950.png": "\r\n\"In seeking for nitrate of soda the searchers always look\r\nto the rising edge of such salt-basins, and further judge of\r\nthe probability of finding the nitrate from a peculiar moist\r\nor clammy state of the ground, which is due to the presence\r\nof the chloride of calcium produced by the decomposition\r\nabove explained.\r\n\r\n\"The quantity of sulphates, and more especially of sulphate\r\nof lime, included invariably in these deposits might\r\nat first sight appear to the observer too great to suppose it\r\ndue only to the evaporation of the sea-water; but I believe\r\nthat this impression will be dissipated when he sees the\r\nenormous amount of gypsum removed in the form of hard\r\nwhite cakes, or sedimentary crust, from the boilers of the\r\nlarge distilling machines in use along this arid coast for\r\nproducing from the water of the sea a supply of fresh water\r\nfor the maintenance of the inhabitants, beasts of burden,\r\nand even the locomotive engines of the railways along this\r\ncoast. It appears not necessary to suppose, as has been put\r\nforth, that the sulphates present have been formed by volcanic\r\nexhalations acting upon the beds of salt. The boracic\r\nacid compounds met with appear, however, to be due to\r\nthis cause; and the borate of lime met with in such large\r\nquantities appears to be indirectly produced by the condensed\r\nvapours of volcanic fumeroles, many of which are\r\nstill in full activity in this district. The saline deposits\r\nof this series do not rest directly on the rock itself, but on\r\na beach more or less level or hollowed out into lagoon-basins,\r\nand composed, as the present and the raised sea-beach\r\npreviously described, of the d\u00e9bris of the adjacent\r\nporphyritic, dioritic, and volcanic rocks.\"\r\n\r\nNow, having set forth at length and ipsimis verbis, the\r\ntheories of such scientists as Darwin, Forbes, et c\u0153teri[**c\u00e6teri ],\r\nwhich have a fair share of support in the opinions and",
  "p2960.png": "theories of local experts like Mr. Whitelegg, it must be\r\nadmitted, I think, that there are objections of considerable\r\ngravity to the easy acceptance of some of them. Take the\r\nlagoon theory and then explain how it is that the Nitrate\r\nhas settled on the western slopes only? A commission\r\ndirected by the Chilian Government to inquire into and\r\nreport on the origin of Nitrate fields some time ago expressed\r\nthe opinion that the lagoon theory would not hold\r\nwater, and that the idea of the salitreras being due to volcanically-formed\r\nfiords was fanciful. The Commission\r\ncame to the conclusion that the nitrate of soda deposits\r\nwere simply the result of the decomposition of feldspathic\r\nrocks by the action of dry air, their soda was carbonized\r\nand thus became Carbonate of Soda, which then, from\r\ncontact with the nitrogen of the air, produced Nitric Acid,\r\nand in conjunction with the oxides in its surroundings,\r\nfinally formed Nitrate of Soda.\r\n\r\nHerr Noller, more than twenty years ago, announced it\r\nas \"indisputable that the Nitrate of Soda owed its origin\r\nto seaweed, the nitrogenous collector of Iodine. By the\r\nvolcanic elevation of the ground, either gradual or sudden,\r\nimmense salt-water lakes were formed in which prodigious\r\nbeds of seaweed, such as are found to-day in the Sargasso\r\nSea, were isolated, and decayed as the sea-water evaporated.\r\nNitric Acid, which is the final product of the decay of\r\nnitrogenous or organic matter, became Nitrate of Calcium\r\nby uniting with the chalk supplied by the shells and\r\nlimestone in the beds of the lakes. This reacting on\r\nSodium Sulphates yielded Nitrate of Soda and Calcium\r\nSulphate.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a theory which finds acceptance among some\r\nwriters that it is our misty and chilly friend, \"Camanchaca,\"\r\nwhich has provided Tarapac\u00e2 with such ample",
  "p2970.png": "compensation for its presence. This vaporous Camanchaca\r\nis, they say, gifted with an infusion of Ammonia. Near\r\nat hand you see the tremendous workshop of the Andes, for\r\never pouring, in solution in the melting snow, the salts\r\nwhich are contained within their rocky entrails on the\r\nPampas, where the Ammonia of the Camanchaca, aided\r\nby electric influences which prevail in the district of\r\nTarapac\u00e2[**\u00e1 ?], &c., converts the Chloride, into Nitrate, of\r\nSodium!\r\n\r\nThe intelligent gentlemen who are at the head of the\r\noficinas concur generally, I think, in the theory which\r\nDarwin favoured. Some of them are very precise indeed\r\nin their theories, and demonstrate the modus operandi with\r\nas much positiveness as if they had assisted at it. I\r\nwas not able, however, to obtain a satisfactory explanation\r\nof one matter. If the caliche was formed by the\r\nevaporation of sea water, how is it that the components of\r\ncaliche are not identical with those of the precipitate\r\nobtained by the evaporation of sea water? The proportion\r\nof Nitrate of Soda to Sulphate and Chloride of Soda is\r\nconsiderably larger in caliche than it is in the result of a\r\nsimple evaporation of sea water. The answer given by\r\nthe experts to the difficulty was that when the lagoons\r\nwere gradually drying up a chemical change took place in\r\nconsequence of the decay of vegetable, as well as of animal,\r\nsubstances, the presence of which cannot be readily explained,\r\nand that the result was the formation of Nitrate\r\nof Soda. An expert will be able to determine the site of\r\ncaliche by a mere inspection of the ground. He will look\r\nfor it not on the level plain, but in the upheaved hills on\r\nthe western slopes of the cavities, where the sea, in the\r\ncourse of many centuries, fretting against a margin of\r\nweeds, rushes, and marine vegetation, gradually evaporated",

  "p3000.png": "on the vast continent from which they had shaken off the\r\ngrasp of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn very old days, almost at the outset of Spanish\r\ndomination, there were jealousies and contentions between\r\nthe Viceroys of Peru and the other lieutenants of the\r\nKing, who ruled over tracts far more extensive than the\r\nPeninsula at home, but the hand of the King, for the time\r\nbeing, held the swords of his lieutenants in the sheath.\r\nFrontier questions especially occasioned acrimonious disputes.\r\nBetween Peru and Chile there was a very early\r\nmanifestation of traditional dislike when each was free to\r\nact for itself. An opportunity for active aggression was\r\ngiven to Chile in 1835, by the interference of the President\r\nof Bolivia, General Santa Cruz, in the internal affairs\r\nof Peru. He was a man of great ability and of enlightened\r\nviews. Accused by his enemies of aspiring to a dictatorship\r\nor to a throne, he would very probably, had his policy\r\nbeen allowed to run its course in Bolivia, have saved that\r\nrich and interesting region from the insecure isolation in\r\nwhich it is at present situated, distrustful of its neighbours,\r\nwithout a port for its commerce, its voice almost unheard\r\non the American Continent and altogether silent in Europe.\r\nSanta Cruz invaded Peru, defeated Gamarra, the President,\r\nand founded a confederation based on the offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance of Peru and Bolivia. The Chilian Government\r\nof the day resolved to attack the menacing alliance\r\nwhich they saw rising up on their borders. General\r\nManuel Bulnes, whose conduct of the operations was\r\nmarked by ability and sagacity, anticipating the operations\r\nof the late war, marched into Peru, and, using with success\r\nthe superior maritime resources of Chile, obtained possession\r\nof Callao and Lima, and finally defeated Santa Cruz\r\nwith great slaughter at Yungai in January, 1839. He was",
  "p3010.png": "thus successful in breaking up the confederation, and--more\r\nthan that--in creating a conflict between Peru and\r\nBolivia which led to the despatch of an army under\r\nGamarra, now installed as President of Peru, into Bolivia,\r\nwhere it was completely defeated by General Ballivian.

Santa Cruz was not restored to power, and from\r\n1848, when Ballivian's term of office expired, till the war\r\nwhich established the supremacy of Chile in 1879-81,\r\nBolivia was ruled by savage despots, the heroes of insurrections\r\nand conspiracies, who were fortunate in the indifference\r\nof the neighbouring states to their excesses.\r\n\r\nA frontier dispute is generally bitter, and in 1861 there\r\narose a question between the republics respecting their\r\nrespective boundaries in the desert of Atacama, which very\r\nnearly led to a declaration of war by Bolivia. Chile drew her\r\nnorthern frontier at lat. 23\u00b0 south. Bolivia insisted on lat.\r\n24\u00b0 south as the demarcation of her territory from Chile.\r\nThere is a line now drawn on the map between the States,\r\nbut it certainly would not be impassable if those on either side\r\nof it had strength to risk the consequences of a step beyond.\r\nThe dispute, which was a constant cause of apprehension\r\nand anxiety for nearly ten years, was settled for the time\r\nwithout bloodshed in 1872. Six years previously Melgarejo,[*]\r\nwho provoked Lord Palmerston to decree that\r\nBolivia should be wiped off the diplomatic and political map\r\nof the world, made a treaty with Chile for the adjustment of\r\nthe frontier quarrel, which was annulled by his successor\r\nMorales.

The Government\r\nat Santiago came to know of a sudden that Peru\r\nand Bolivia had made an offensive and defensive treaty\r\nwhich was in effect intended to combine the powers of\r\nboth the republics, in case of war, against Chile.

The Government of Chile resolved to\r\nprotect the Chilians against imposts which they declared\r\nwere violations of treaty rights, and when the Bolivian\r\nauthorities seized on the property of the Nitrate Company\r\nand decreed the sale of it by public auction, they were\r\ndisagreeably convinced of their inability to execute their\r\ndecree by the appearance of 500 Chilian soldiers from\r\nCaldera, who landed at Antofagasta and took possession of it.\r\n\r\nIf the desert of Atacama, which had a traditional reputation\r\nfor mineral wealth, had not blossomed into cuprates\r\nand nitrates, Chile, perhaps, would not have found any\r\nparticular charm in the region, nor would she have sought,\r\nunder any compulsion, to remove her neighbour's landmarks.\r\nWhy should it have been otherwise? The\r\nwealth poured into the treasury of Peru from the barren\r\nrocks which were the haunts of pelicans and their congeners\r\nfor countless ages, might well have aroused the cupidity\r\nand inflamed the jealousy of a neighbouring state, which\r\nwas, it is said, struggling hard at the time to keep its head\r\nabove the rising tide of bankruptcy, and the conduct of the\r\nGovernment of Peru, and of General Daza, gave Chile an\r\nexcellent opportunity of making a bold stroke for fortune\r\nwith some show of reason and excuse.\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" says the proverb, \"becomes very wicked all\r\nat once.\" I say people may do so, if they become all of a\r\nsudden immensely rich, for then they at once seek to become\r\nricher.

She is puffed up with military pride,\r\nand if any great shake were given to her financial\r\nposition, from the failure of exports on which her revenue\r\ndepends, she would look beyond her frontiers for some\r\nprofitable appropriation. Neither Peru nor Bolivia would\r\nbe able to make head against her. Who, then, are likely\r\nto do so? The Argentine Republic might find it convenient\r\nto have an ally instead of an enemy at the other side of\r\nthe Andes who could be of substantial assistance in the\r\ndirection of Uruguay in case of need, and Brazil is now\r\nnot at all likely to step across her western and southern\r\nfrontiers, so Chile would have nothing to fear if the Great\r\nPowers did not interfere.

Perhaps\r\ntheir best plea for their neglect would be that they did not\r\nknow how and where to begin their labours, and that till\r\nthey had themselves learned some of the arts of civilised\r\nlife, they could not teach them to others.

He has his small patch of\r\nland, perhaps more than the three acres and the cow which\r\nhave been set forth as the summum bonum of the English\r\nlabourer, but he has very little capital. His wants are\r\nsmall, his idea of household comfort limited. Perhaps\r\na Dorsetshire labourer would not think a pound loaf at\r\nbreakfast, a pound of beans or maize cooked with lard\r\nfor dinner, and a pound loaf and a dish of bruised corn at\r\nnight very sumptuous fare. But it is at least ample in\r\nquantity. It is in quality wholesome and nutritious, and\r\na Chilian will work on it for twelve hours a day under\r\na broiling sun.

  "p3100.png": "\r\nChile has enjoyed an exemption from any serious disturbance\r\nfor nearly forty years. The reason, perhaps, for that\r\nexemption from the curse of the States of South America\r\nis the aristocratic nature of the government, and the ready\r\nsubmission of the governing classes to the power of the\r\nPresident, who is virtually C\u00e6sar for five years. The constitution\r\nwhich was reformed, or at all events reorganized,\r\nin 1833, while it did not interfere ostensibly with the\r\nrights guaranteed under the legal code of the South\r\nAmerican Justinian, Se\u00f1or Bello, conferred upon the President\r\na power which is practically, when it is supported\r\nby the Senate and the Chamber, absolute. He governs, if\r\nhe does not reign. With the concurrence of his Council of\r\nState he can apparently do in Chile all that the Parliament\r\ncan do in England, and the exercise of his power is only\r\nlimited by considerations of public policy. As the qualifications\r\nof the voter are based upon education and upon the\r\npayment of a considerable income-tax, a very high class of\r\nvoters is secured. Based on that of the United States,\r\nthe constitution of Chile has, however, some remarkable\r\ndepartures from the excessive liberality which characterizes\r\nthe suffrage in some of the States further north. There is\r\na property qualification required from senators and deputies,\r\nwhich under the old value of money would represent \u00a3100\r\nand \u00a3400 per annum respectively. The elector must be\r\nable to read and write, and prove that he earns at least\r\n$150 a year. The members of the Council of State,\r\nappointed by the President, are necessarily his own, for\r\nthey are appointed by him and are removable as he pleases.\r\nHis ministers countersign decrees pro form\u00e2.

  "p3110.png": "national will, the public opinion of the nation, the intelligence\r\nand spirit of the great proprietors or hacendados--the\r\nbroad-acred squires and landed gentry--and the sturdy\r\nresolute character of the people, who combine with an\r\nardent patriotism a considerable amount of respect for their\r\nown individual liberties and of regard for the rights of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian giant stands on silver, copper, and nitrate of\r\nsoda; but at times he seems disposed to pick away some\r\nof the ground on which he rests his feet. The respectable\r\nfinancial condition of Chile depends mainly for its maintenance\r\non the export of silver, copper and on nitrate, the\r\nexport duty on which furnishes more than one-third of the\r\nentire revenue of Chile.[*]\r\n\r\nThe President and his advisers are anxious to resume\r\nmetallic currency and to abolish paper, but Se\u00f1or Balmaceda\r\nwas obliged to tell Congress last year that all\r\nefforts in that direction would be ineffective until the\r\nbalance of trade in favour of Chilian exports was established.\r\n\"It is necessary,\" said he, \"to encourage by all\r\nreasonable means the copper trade, agricultural pursuits,\r\nand the manufacture of nitrate, and to obtain for Chile\r\nat least a part of the immense benefits of the nitrate\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Balmaceda, announcing a number of projects\r\nof law for the improvement of finance, declared that\r\nthe most important was one regulating the sale of the\r\nnitrate grounds--that is, the nitrate grounds in the\r\nprovince of Tarapac\u00e1, now possessed by Chile, formerly\r\nbelonging to the republic of Peru. The President pro-*\r\n\r\n* The value of the exported silver and copper in the four years from 1884\r\nto 1888 was $615,436,214, being 68 per cent. of the value of all the mineral\r\nproduce sent out of the country. In the same period Chile exported $4,205,284\r\nof gold.",
  "p3120.png": "*posed a \"solution,\" as he called it, \"in a matter concerning\r\nan article which belongs to Chile, and can only\r\nbe exported from its territory.\" He proposed that \"the\r\nnitrate grounds should be divided into districts, to be sold\r\nat public auction, good, medium, and inferior caliche\r\nbeing included in one lot, and that 4,000 estacas, selected\r\nfrom best Government land, should be appropriated, to be\r\nworked by Chilian companies, all the shareholders to be\r\nChilians, the shares not to be transferable for a time, and\r\nthen to be transferred to Chilians only.\" Then would\r\ncome another golden age. Once the redeemed salitres\r\nwere sold, and the 4,000 estacas were distributed for the\r\nestablishment of national works, every succeeding year one-half\r\nof one estaca should be sold at auction to the highest\r\nbidder, and the other half of the estaca to Chilian buyers,\r\non the basis of shares not transferable to foreigners. In\r\nthis manner the free production of nitrate would not be\r\nimpeded, and the pursuit of this business would be confided\r\nto men with Chilian capital and the oficinas would be\r\nworked by Chilian manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\"The importance of nitrate in agriculture and commerce,\r\nand the gradual increase of its production,\" said the President,\r\n\"warns the legislature and the authorities not to\r\ndemur in solving this problem, and to protect effectively the\r\nlegitimate interests of our countrymen. It is true that we\r\nshould not exclude the free competition and manufacture\r\nof nitrate in Tarapac\u00e1; but we cannot consent that this\r\nrich and extensive region should become simply a foreign\r\nfactory. It is a certain and important fact which cannot\r\nbe disguised, that owing to the singularity of the business,\r\nthe manner in which property has been acquired, the absorption\r\nof the small foreign capital, and the character of\r\nthe different races that will contest the control of that vast",
  "p3130.png": "and fertile business, a special legislation is necessary on the\r\nbasis of the nature of things and the peculiar needs of our\r\ncommercial and financial existence. This question is of great\r\nimportance for the future, and on it depends to a great extent\r\nthe development of our individual wealth, now held at a\r\ndistance from this centre of labour and general prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThe President did not attempt to explain why it\r\nwas that Chilians, on ground which had been made their\r\nown by force of arms, needed special legislation to enable\r\nthem to work nitrate fields, which were as open to\r\nthem as they were to the strangers whose capital and\r\nenterprise were to be handicapped by restrictive legislation.\r\nHe was not concerned to show how capital was\r\nto be provided to turn to account the properties which\r\nthe State proposed to assign to them. There are very\r\nwealthy people in Chile, and there are many Chilians\r\nwith capital. But, though there are many Chilian nitrate\r\nmakers, there has not been a very marked tendency to turn\r\nthe money possessed by merchants and landed proprietors\r\nto the extension of the nitrate industry. No bank would\r\nlend money on property over which it can exercise no legal\r\nrights. Chilians alone must advance the money which is\r\nnecessary to turn the possession of them to account for\r\nthe working of these Chilian nitrate-fields. No non-Chilian\r\ncan enter on possession of these national nitrate properties,\r\nand there is apparently no means of securing money advanced\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThe result of the policy thus enunciated is to be seen\r\nhereafter, for as yet there has been, I believe, no general\r\nmovement among the Chilians to take advantage of the\r\nprivileges accorded to them. But the principle is announced\r\nand it meets with general approval. The year 1888\r\nwas exceedingly prosperous. The effect of the copper",
  "p3140.png": "\"krach,\" and of the disturbances in nitrates, on the returns\r\nof 1889, will not be known until this year is well advanced,\r\nbut it will be surprising if the great increase in the value\r\nof exports and imports, which marked 1888 as compared\r\nwith 1887, will be sustained. Mr. Kennedy, the British\r\nMinister at Santiago, in forwarding an extract from the\r\n\"Extradista Comercial\" of Chile to the Foreign Office,\r\nmakes a significant summary of the opinions of Se\u00f1or\r\nTorres, which probably represent those of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"It is admitted that Chile can no longer regulate the\r\nprice of copper, but it is claimed that she can still retain\r\nher hold as an important factor in the copper industry of\r\nthe world by the adoption of certain measures; such as,\r\nfor instance, the expropriation of the mineral railways, the\r\nconstruction of roads, the introduction of improved systems\r\nof mining and smelting, and the employment of the necessary\r\namount of capital in mining undertakings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Expropriation\" is an ugly word, if it means that\r\nChile is to place her own price on the property she seeks to\r\nacquire. Mr. Kennedy goes on to say--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to nitrate, Se\u00f1or Torres does not share in\r\nthe opinion, recently mooted here by a firm of brokers, of\r\na crisis being imminent owing to over-production; but, on\r\nthe contrary, he is of the opinion, and he bases his opinion\r\non interesting facts and figures, that what with the probable\r\ndepreciation of gold, the extension of the actual consuming\r\nmarkets, and the opening up of new ones, there is a brilliant\r\nfuture in store for the salt, which in 1888 figured in our\r\nexports for $33,866,196, and in eleven years, 1878-88,\r\nfor a grand total of $231,451,444, and which contributed\r\nto the national revenue, in 1888, in the form of export\r\nduty, the large sum of $17,838,978.\"\r\n\r\nAt the interviews which the President had with Colonel",
  "p3150.png": "North at Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Santiago, he evinced an\r\nequitable appreciation of the true interests of the State,\r\nin respect for private rights, and of the policy to be\r\npursued in a country which needs a continuance of the\r\nsteady flow of the capital by which it has been floated into a\r\ncondition of comparative ease, to place it in a position to\r\nmature its own resources, and at the same time to secure\r\nthe advantages derived from the inventions, enterprise,\r\nindustry, and wealth of foreigners.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency's speeches at Iquique, and at other places\r\nwhere he addressed audiences, foreign and Chilian, early in\r\nthe year, excited uneasiness in the minds of those engaged in\r\nthe mineral industries. It was natural that a President of\r\nChile, speaking to Chilians, should point to the great extent\r\nof territory abounding in mineral riches which had as yet\r\nbeen untouched, and that he should encourage Chilians to\r\nenter into the race for wealth, in which foreigners had\r\nhitherto been permitted to run almost alone. His meaning\r\nwas, it seems, imperfectly conveyed, and Se\u00f1or Balmaceda\r\ndisavowed the construction placed on some of his words.\r\nBut it was inferred, especially from his speech at Iquique,\r\nthat he intended, if he could, to close the course to\r\nany but native competitors, to handicap those who had\r\nbeen the winners, to refuse industrial concessions in\r\nthe country to non-Chilian residents, and to reserve the\r\nState lands still unappropriated, exclusively and inalienably,\r\nto citizens of the Republic. Although there was no\r\nexpress intimation of any intention on the part of Government\r\nto lay hands upon, or, as the phrase in Chile goes,\r\nto \"expropriate,\" the railways, it was well known that\r\nsuch a project was in favour with some politicians at\r\nSantiago, and some expressions in President Balmaceda's\r\ndiscourses were taken to indicate the likelihood of future",

There was very\r\nlittle uncertainty in the words of the speech which\r\nPresident Balmaceda, in very guarded terms, addressed\r\nto the Chilian Congress last year as a programme for\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nBut in speeches of less responsibility and greater freedom,\r\ndelivered by the President in various towns in the\r\ncourse of his progress through the country, there were\r\nother references to the same topics which created considerable\r\nagitation. It would be regretable[**P1: regrettable?] indeed if events\r\nproved that the uneasiness was justified, but experience,\r\nshort though it be, may open the eyes of the Government\r\nto the dangers with which Chile would be menaced by the\r\npossible loss of confidence in her good faith.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful despot in the world cannot be indifferent\r\nto the national feeling of the country he governs.\r\nLet it be admitted that it needs tact and resolution in Chile\r\nas elsewhere to manipulate political parties so as to promote\r\nthe interests of the State without creating jealousy at home\r\nor want of confidence abroad.

These indicate mines formerly worked and\r\nabandoned, and mines still in the course of exploitation.\r\nThe State owns all precious ores, stones, and fossil substances,\r\nbut it gives power to private persons to search for\r\nmines, and to work them. The working of coal and of\r\nother fossil mines is ceded to the owner of the soil. The\r\nState reserves to itself deposits of guano, nitrate and ammoniacal\r\nsalts, in land in which mining rights had not\r\nbeen acquired by private persons.\r\n\r\nThe mining laws of Chile constitute a corpus juridicum\r\nof great extent and complexity. To encourage explorers\r\nsuch liberal protection is accorded to prospectors that it\r\nseems inconsistent with the rights of property. No owner\r\ncan veto the operations of a mineseeker upon his land; the\r\ncompensation awarded by law, in relation to results, is,\r\nhowever, strictly defined.\r\n\r\nDarwin says that the Chilian Government, or rather the\r\nold Spanish law, encourages by every method, the searching\r\nfor mines. \"The discoverer may work a mine on any\r\nground by paying 5s., and before paying this he may try\r\neven in the garden of another man for twenty days.\"\r\n\r\nMiers, who lived in Chile for some years before Darwin's\r\nvisit, says in his excellent work:--\r\n\r\n\"I should lament to hear that any British capitalist,\r\nhowever flattering the offers made to him, should invest his\r\ncapital in any enterprise upon the soil of Chile; having\r\nmyself failed in such an attempt from impediments that\r\nnaturally exist in the country, together with the absurd",
  "p3180.png": "obstacles opposed by the general and local authorities, as\r\nwell as by the obstinate jealousies of the natives, notwithstanding\r\nall the flattering inducements that were held out\r\nand the outward show of protection afforded in an especial\r\nmanner to me individually.\"\r\n\r\nApparently his experience of mining was not favourable,\r\nand his warning was no doubt well founded when it was\r\nwritten. Under the most liberal conditions mining is precarious,\r\nand in Chile the risks were much increased in the\r\ncase of foreigners. The mining laws of Chile were described\r\nto me \"as the plague of owners of property, the dread of\r\ncapitalists, and the delight of lawyers.\" It was said in\r\nthe old days, \"a man will make money out of a copper\r\nmine; he may make money out of a silver mine; he is\r\nsure to lose in a gold mine.\" I met men who had lost\r\nlarge sums of money, and I met some who had attained to\r\ngreat wealth in mining enterprise. I am bound to say the\r\nformer far exceeded the latter in number. But whatever\r\nmay have been the defects of the old law, the code which\r\ncame into force quite recently has, undoubtedly, done\r\nmuch to facilitate the acquisition of mining property, and\r\nthe working of mines in Chile. Mr. J. H. Thomas,\r\nBritish Vice-Consul at Santiago, lately forwarded through\r\nMr. Kennedy, the Minister, a translation of the Code,\r\nwhich has been laid before Parliament. The Minister,\r\nwho had only recently arrived, in sending the Report to\r\nthe Foreign Office, although agreeing with Mr. Thomas in\r\nthe opinion that the new laws would confer great benefit\r\non the mining industries, influenced perhaps by his want of\r\nknowledge, thought it right to add that \"he was not prepared\r\nto support the recommendations of the Vice-Consul as\r\nto the advantages offered to investors by the gold mines of\r\nChile.'[**P2: \"] According to Mr. Thomas, \"the facilities offered",
  "p3190.png": "by the new law over the old lies in the establishment of\r\nperfect titles to the properties without the risk of their\r\nbeing disputed, which was constantly the case under the\r\nformer order of things. To maintain the legal possession\r\nof a mine under the old law, four men had to be constantly\r\nemployed in it, whether there was work to do or not; and\r\nwithout regard to the owner's ability to support them,\r\neither out of his own funds or the produce of the mine.\r\nThe result was that the poorer miners were obliged to seek\r\naid to carry out the preliminary works of the mine, and to\r\nmaintain the four workmen therein by ceding a part of\r\ntheir discovery or property, or run the risk of having the\r\nproperty denounced any day by unscrupulous parties only\r\ntoo vigilant in surprising him in the non fulfilment of that\r\nvery onerous condition, either to blackmail him, or actually\r\nobtain possession of the mine, if it was thought to be a\r\ngood one; the whole affair generally ended in one or more\r\nlaw suits, each more complicated and interminable than\r\nthe last, and not in the profitable working or development\r\nof the mine.\r\n\r\n\"The present law obviates all those difficulties in the\r\nmost effective way, by constituting a perfect title to the\r\nproperty in virtue of the payment to the Government of an\r\nannual license, in accordance with the nature of each property.\r\nUnder this title, which, when properly established\r\nby law, is immutable and perpetual, the owner may work\r\nhis property or not, as he pleases, and with the number of\r\nworkmen and in the conditions he may think fit; and he\r\nmay freely transfer his property to anybody, and the latter\r\nmay receive it without any fear of his title being impugned,\r\nuntil he voluntarily relinquishes it.\r\n\r\n\"There are other and important improvements in the\r\nnew law, which will doubtless produce their fruits before",

All the gold\r\nmines ran at a certain depth into iron pyrites, and as the\r\nchlorination processes were then unknown fully 60 per\r\ncent. of the gold was lost in washing the pyrites. But\r\nChile still, according to Se\u00f1or Martinez, possesses the\r\nlargest number of gold mines and deposits in the world.\r\nWhen I was at Santiago I heard of many gold mines in\r\nthe ravines near the sources of the Mapocho River, of the\r\nColino, &c., but there was little or no work, and therefore\r\nlittle produce from them. There are said to be many gold",
  "p3210.png": "mines in the province of Rancagua, especially at Elque.\r\nMr. Thomas believes, if his plan were adopted, that\r\nChilian gold would in a year become more famous as a\r\nsource of wealth than nitrate of soda. For my own part I\r\nwould prefer making an investment in an oficina to sinking\r\nmoney in a mine.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish jurists bequeathed to the South American\r\nRepublics a very intricate and perplexing legal system.\r\nIn disputes between Chilians and natives, the theoretical\r\nequality existing in the eye of the law between them is\r\noccasionally subjected, it is said, to \"dislocation.\" But, as\r\nfar as I could learn, the bench is above corruption, being\r\nvery different in that respect from the magistrature in an\r\nadjoining state, where the judges can be and are bought\r\nat a price. The same high official character is maintained\r\nin the political life of Chile. The statesmen and chief\r\npoliticians in and out of Government are above suspicion.\r\nIt would be more correct to say, perhaps, that any accusations\r\nof corruption levelled at them by opponents were\r\nincapable of proof. Lobbying has not attained to the status\r\nof a profession in Congress, but it is scarcely to be expected\r\nthat private influence should be altogether ignored in\r\nlegislation dealing with concessions, contracts, public\r\nworks, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe Chilians call themselves, I was told, \"the English\r\nof South America.\" I am bound to say that I never\r\nheard any Chilian make use of the expression, or of the\r\nphrase \"on the word of an Englishman,\" attributed to\r\nthem as the strongest affirmation that they can make of\r\na fact. Nevertheless, they affect a high standard of public\r\nand personal integrity, and there is nothing any official of\r\nthe Republic would fear so much as the insinuation that\r\nhe had been \"got at.\" Even the highest personage in",

The English press,\r\nwhich only seems to be aware of the existence of the States\r\nof South America when there is a revolution affecting bonds\r\nand shares, a great convulsion of nature, or a war there,\r\nscarcely noticed the International Congress held at Monte\r\nVideo, at which, as President Balmaceda announced, the\r\nChilian representatives signed treaties with their neighbours\r\nconcerning artistic and literary rights, trade-marks,\r\npatents, international commercial rights, partnerships, insurances\r\non land and sea, life-insurance freights, maritime\r\nloans, averages, lawsuits, judgments, and decisions of arbitrators,\r\n&c. The delegates of Chile, however, would not\r\nsign the treaties proposed by the Argentines concerning\r\ncriminal and civil international codes, because they were not\r\nin harmony with the law of Chile. With similar caution,\r\nand perhaps more reasonably suspicious, Chile, in accepting\r\nthe invitation of the United States to the great conference\r\nat Washington this year, declared that she would attend\r\nit solely to discuss social and economical problems.

Its\r\nlimits southwards were conterminous with the northern\r\nfrontier of Chile.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to ascertain when the native manufacture\r\nof nitrate of soda began on the Pampas, or when the\r\nvalue of it was recognised. Bolivian agriculturists have the\r\ncredit of being the first to import the salt from Peru. The\r\nearly native manufactories (paradas), of which there are\r\nabundant ruins and traces all over the Pampas, were built\r\nof adobe. The raw material or caliche was boiled down in\r\ncopper boilers (fonda) placed over open fireplaces, the salt\r\nbeing doubtless subjected to some refining process to fit\r\nit for the market.\r\n\r\nWhen attention was first directed to the mineral wealth\r\nof Tarapac\u00e1 the Government of Peru divided the Pampas\r\ninto small holdings, about four acres in extent, and gave\r\nthem to residents there. It may be inferred that there were",
  "p3240.png": "at the time disputes about the mines, or that the uses of\r\nnitrate of soda as a fertiliser were already recognised. According\r\nto Captain Castle, the Government of Peru became\r\naware that there was a great future for nitrate industry\r\nfor the first time in 1832, but what they did to facilitate\r\nits advent I do not know. When the exports from Iquique\r\nbegan to mount up to millions of quintals per annum, the\r\nPeruvian Government thought that they would derive\r\nsome benefit from the business. In 1873 accordingly they\r\npromulgated an ordinance that the oficinas on the nitrate\r\nfields should be sold to the State, and that, in the event\r\nof the owners refusing the terms offered, a duty of 1\u00b750\r\ndollars per quintal should be levied on the export of the\r\nsalt. The owners selected the first of the alternatives, but\r\nthe State was not ready with the money for the purchase,\r\nand nothing was done. In 1875 the Peruvian Government\r\nmade another attempt, passed a compulsory Act for the sale\r\nof all nitrate properties to the State, and arranged that the\r\nvalue of these should be assessed by Peruvian officials.\r\nCaptain Castle says:--\r\n\r\n\"Arbitrators were appointed to fix a reasonable price\r\nfor sale. However, the amount assessed by the arbitrators\r\nreached to such an enormous sum that the Government\r\nwere unwilling to pay the money down, and had recourse\r\nto issuing certificates, each representing the amount of\r\n$1,000 at 44d., bearing 8% interest and 5% amortization.\r\nOn these terms the Salitreros still continued manufacturing,\r\nthe Government contracting to pay them $1\u00b770 per quintal,\r\nat 40d. f. o. b. (that is, \"placed in lighters outside the surf.\")\r\nThe Government also claimed all nitrate beds not actually\r\nworking as State property. Thus the State came possessed\r\nof all the nitrate manufactured, which was sent by them to\r\ntheir agents in Europe, who sold it at great profit. The",
  "p3250.png": "monopoly was afterwards rented by the Cia Salitreros of\r\nPeru to pay advances made by the Government, and afterwards\r\nto the Bancos Associados for a similar service. The\r\nBanks thus became Government agents. In 1878, during\r\nthe war, the nitrate district came under the rule of Chile.\r\nThe manufacturers feared their new masters, and sold, as\r\nbest they could, their interest in it. Really there was\r\nnothing to fear, for when the Chilians took possession of\r\nTarapac\u00e1 they allowed the owners of the Peruvian nitrate\r\ncertificates or bonds to take and hold the various oficinas,\r\nthe face of the bond being cancelled on their being handed\r\nto the Government, thus relieving the Chilian Government\r\nof all responsibility. Next came the reaction after the\r\nwar. On the 2nd September, 1880, the President of Chile\r\naddressed a memorandum to Antonio Alfonso, Military and\r\nCivil Governor of the province of Tarapac\u00e1, ordering him to\r\npermit and encourage the manufacture of nitrate of soda, and\r\nstating that further instructions would be sent to him.\r\nA survey was made of the nitrate district; the certificates\r\nwhich had been issued to the former Government were\r\nfor the time recognised; and finally, in 1882, the certificates\r\nwere classed as follows:--Oficinas redeemed in virtue\r\nof the Supreme Decree of 28th of March, 1882; oficinas\r\nsold by public auction in virtue of Supreme Decree of 31st\r\nof July, 1882; oficinas restored to their original owners\r\nby the Intendente of the State; oficinas occupied on leases\r\nof elaboration in accordance with the order of the Supreme\r\nGovernment of 21st September, 1881; oficinas held by the\r\nState, and in keeping by the Inspector-General of Nitrate.\r\n\r\n\"The value of nitrate property was as follows:--\r\n\r\nAppraised value of the 166 oficinas of nitrate of}\r\nsoda property on Tarapac\u00e1} $21,375,203 (a)\r\n\r\nValue of nitrate grounds which do not pay rent $1,617,600 (b)",

We will next pass to the\r\nwork that has been accomplished by enterprising foreigners\r\nand natives. It was no small venture for a foreigner or\r\neven a native to lay out capital on acquired property\r\non the desert of Tarapac\u00e1, for desert it was. Nothing\r\nbut space, no tree on which the eye could rest; no communication\r\nwith the outside world except on foot or\r\nhorseback; self-abnegation, so predominant in the pioneers\r\nof commerce, was soon rewarded. The fame of nitrate\r\nof soda reached the agriculturists of Europe; demands\r\ncame from Germany, the Netherlands, and France, and",
  "p3270.png": "as fast as it could be produced it found a ready market\r\nat remunerative prices. Greater and greater became the\r\ndemand for this wonderful fertilizer; it eclipsed guano, and\r\nthe Peruvian Government saw before it a source of revenue\r\nthat would facilitate its financial operations for many years\r\nto come. In those days business between the Peruvians\r\nand foreigners was easy; concessions were made freely,\r\nmachinery was imported, and the desert of Tarapac\u00e1 was\r\nteeming with industry. The anchorage of Iquique became\r\nthe resort of shipping varying from 500 to 1,200\r\ntons. Ship freights were high; business brisk; and\r\nlabour expensive. Skilled labour rose to an immense\r\nvalue; machinery for want of transport often remained in\r\nthe port of Iquique, there being no skilled labour to erect\r\nit. There was no railroad to the Pampa; every article of\r\nfood had to be carried on mule back to an elevation of\r\n3,000 feet, and then across a desert; water, however, was\r\nprocurable in certain places; wells were sunk to water\r\ncattle, and to assist in the elaboration of nitrate of soda.\r\nIn the port of Iquique great difficulty was experienced in\r\nlanding heavy plant, and embarking and disembarking\r\ngoods of every description. The anchorage, although exposed\r\nto the sea, is well protected. An island off the port\r\nbreaks the long rolling swell of the Pacific, and the wind\r\nnever blows home. Ships lay at anchor, moored head and\r\nstern in long tiers; as many as 100 ships have been at\r\nanchor off the port, flying the flags of Great Britain, Germany,\r\nFrance, Italy, Norway, and America, besides smaller\r\ncraft of Peru and Chili. During the war, the blockade of\r\nthe coast adjacent to the nitrate districts had materially\r\naltered the basis of this industry, having reduced the exportation\r\nfrom 7,122,266 quintals in 1878, to 3,307,000\r\nquintals in 1879. Further, the Chilian Government had",
  "p3280.png": "imposed a tax of 1\u00b760 cents. per metrique quintal, against\r\n4 cents. only imposed by Peru on a Spanish quintal. The\r\nsupply of nitrate in the home market had become short\r\nand large quantities had been demanded, so when the\r\nblockade ceased, and elaboration could be re-continued,\r\noficinas were erected in haste, and the work was conducted\r\non a more economical and improved principle. By\r\nthe year 1884 the following was the total capable of\r\nproduction:--In Tarapac\u00e1 and Tocopilla, 23,245,000\r\nquintals; Antofagasta, Caleta Oliva, Taltal, and Agua\r\nBlancas, 3,059,200 quintals; total, 26,304,200 quintals.\r\nThus more nitrate was made than could be consumed by\r\nthe home markets. Far-seeing men recognised that if this\r\nstate of things continued, not only the large elaborators,\r\nbut the small would suffer. At this time some 30 to 40\r\noficinas were at full work. With a view to control the\r\nsupply to the demand, a suggestion was made that the\r\nnitrate manufacturers should combine and fix the amount\r\nthat should be elaborated at each oficina, and how much\r\nshould be exported; the latter, of course, would govern the\r\nquantity of the former. Early in 1884 this movement was\r\non foot. On the 21st of April, 1884, Herm. G. Schmidt\r\nissued a circular to the principal nitrate houses, asking\r\nthem--(1) If they would entertain the idea of reducing the\r\nelaboration, and for what time? (2) How much their oficina\r\nactually could produce? (3) If they were disposed to accept\r\nthe quota assigned to them by the committee on elaboration\r\nand general export, which had been arranged in\r\nconsequence of the demand for this article? On the 16th\r\nMay, Herm. G. Schmidt issued another circular, calling a\r\ngeneral meeting for the 10th June, 1 P.M., at the Salon\r\nFilarmonico. On the day named the meeting was held\r\nand was largely attended. The articles, as revised, which",
  "p3290.png": "had been before the Salitreros during the early part of the\r\nyear, were agreed to unanimously. At the termination of the\r\nmeeting the representatives of many of the principal nitrate\r\nhouses engaged to subscribe their names to a public deed,\r\nbinding themselves to support faithfully the Articles of the\r\nAssociation. A 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero' was next formed. The\r\n'Juncta Directiva[**checked the TIA]' consisted of nine gentlemen, representing\r\nthe districts of Tarapac\u00e1, Tocopilla, Antofagasta, Aguas\r\nBlanca, Taltal, and Valparaiso. Nine other gentlemen,\r\npractically acquainted with the elaboration of nitrate, were\r\nselected to form the Commission of Exports (La Comision\r\nde Peritos); and four gentlemen, skilled in accounts, to form\r\nthe Comision de Contabidad, or Inspectores de Cuentas. Next\r\nfollowed the election of President and Vice-President, and\r\nthe order in which, in either of their absence, the vacancy\r\nshould be filled. H. G. Schmidt was nominated to the important\r\npost of President, J. M. Inglis as Vice-President:\r\nboth these gentlemen representing very considerable interests,\r\nthe former German, the latter English. Both had\r\ntaken part in the formation of this Association. Next\r\nfollowed the election of the President and Vice-President\r\nof the 'Comision de Peritos.' On the 16th June, Se\u00f1ores\r\nL. G. Pochet and P. G. Pascal were elected to fill these\r\noffices. July 14th, 1884, the President issued a circular\r\nto the effect that, in order to start fair, and render equivocation\r\nimpossible, it would be desirable to ascertain on\r\nthe 1st of August the total quantity of nitrate of the\r\n'Asociados' in canchas, bodegas, or in trans-shipment, as\r\nwithout this knowledge it was impossible to regulate the\r\namount to be elaborated. With this object in view, the\r\nSalitreros of Tarapac\u00e1 were to transmit to him by the 31st\r\nJuly a statement as exact as possible, showing the amount\r\nof nitrate of soda on their inventories, books, and other",
  "p3300.png": "accounts; also the quantity on that day on the cancha at\r\ntheir oficinas or en route for embarkation, or embarked as\r\ncargo. And in order to give a true statement of the amount\r\nexisting on the cancha, it would be necessary to appraise\r\nwhat was actually in the boiling tanks, bateas, by a scale\r\nwhich would be common to every oficina; and that at dawn\r\non the 1st August the oficinas in Tarapac\u00e1 were to cease\r\ncharging the cachuchos, and stop altogether the elaboration\r\nof nitrate of soda until the dawn of the 16th morning of\r\nthe same month. Also, if from any unpreventable cause\r\nthe canchas at any of the oficinas on this date were out of\r\nrepair, or being cleaned, and the effect of carrying out these\r\ndirections would entail a greater loss than gain to the\r\nSalitrero; on his representing this, the 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero'\r\nwould permit him to make his quota up to the evening of\r\nthe 15th August, and the 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero' would inform\r\nby circular the other members of the 'Combination' their\r\nreason for so doing. The Comision de Peritos were ordered\r\nto visit all the oficinas on Tarapac\u00e1 during the first fortnight\r\nof the month of August; to compare the Salitreros'\r\nstatements with regard to the power of elaboration with\r\ntheir own observation; and to settle definitely the amount\r\nof saltpetre on the cancha, each amount to be vouched for\r\non duplicate documents by the members of the Comision,\r\nthe owners' legal representatives, or the administrador of\r\nthe oficina. A copy of this document was to be sent to\r\nthe President of the Comit\u00e9 by the 'Comision de Peritos.'\r\nIf a Perito appointed to inspect an oficina had any interest\r\nconnected with it, he was to absent himself from it\r\nduring the inspection. The President, Vice-President, and\r\nother members of the committee might also visit any\r\nbodega or nitrate ready for trans-shipment to ascertain if\r\nthe amounts corresponded with the statement forwarded to",
  "p3310.png": "them on the 31st of July. With respect to ascertaining\r\nthe existence of saltpetre at the oficinas at Tocopilla, Antofagasta,\r\nAguas Blancas, and Taltal, the Committee did this\r\nduty as was most convenient. The President, in addressing\r\nthe members of the Association, said:--'It is necessary for\r\none and all to strictly comply with the rules issued for\r\nthe inspection of the various oficinas, as they had been\r\nformed for the benefit of all the Salitreros.' He further\r\nplaced implicit trust, that every person concerned would\r\nshow perfect faith during the coming proceedings, and\r\nthat individuals would not only study their own interests,\r\nbut also those of others. Accompanying these circulars were\r\nprinted forms, to be used for furnishing the information required.\r\nThe President next informed the Salitreros of the\r\nnames of the Peritos who were selected to visit their oficinas.\r\nThey were told off into sections of three, the district of\r\nTarapac\u00e1 was also divided into three districts--north, central,\r\nand southern; three Peritos were to visit each oficina\r\nin their respective districts; they were each supplied with\r\na statement showing the greatest capable make of the oficina\r\nthey were to visit. The Comision del Norte were to\r\nverify the stock-in-hand of the oficinas in their district, the\r\nComision del Sur were to audit the accounts of the stock-in-hand\r\nof the oficinas of their district; the Comision del\r\nCentro were to revise the stock-in-hand of the oficina in\r\ntheir district. The names also were promulgated of the\r\ngentlemen who were to inspect the stock-in-hand at the\r\nports. On the 6th August, the President informed the\r\n'Salitreros' that the Committee approved of the statements\r\npresented by the Comision de Peritos on the capability of\r\nthe various oficinas that they had visited. These statements\r\nwould, therefore, serve as a basis for a time without prejudice\r\nto pending claims; further, that all the reclaims were to be",
  "p3320.png": "presented in writing, also the capable production of the\r\noficina, and that these claims should be presented before the\r\n15th August, 1885, to the Comit\u00e9 de Peritos as new matter;\r\nalso that during the year, commencing 1st September, only\r\n45 per cent. of a 'full make' should be elaborated, taking\r\nas a basis the amount reported as the greatest capable make\r\nby the 'Comision de Peritos.' On the 21st of August, the\r\nPresident informed the Salitreros that the demands made by\r\noficinas claiming additional productive capacity had been considered,\r\nbut disallowed; he also forwarded a new form (Contrato\r\nde Compra-Venta) between buyer and seller, setting\r\nforth further particulars as to the standard of the nitrate,\r\nthe fines the producers were liable to, the rules for embarking,\r\nand every particular concerning the shipment. On\r\nthe 29th of August the Salitreros were informed that\r\nduring September 'the make' would be reduced from 45\r\nto 40 per cent. On the 9th of October a circular was issued\r\ndecreeing that no nitrate was to be manufactured during\r\nthe mouth of November, with an alternative, that if an\r\noficina worked during that time, it would be only allowed\r\nto work 30 per cent. between 1st November and 1st April,\r\n1885, inclusive, and any oficina that stopped work during\r\nNovember would be allowed to make 40 per cent. during\r\nthe months of January, February, March, 1885. Many of\r\nthe oficinas in the combination stopped work during November.\r\nDuring the early part of 1885, it was decreed\r\nthat only 7,000,000 quintals should be elaborated by the\r\nSalitreros of the Association. Early in January, 1885,\r\nspecial authority was given to the President of the Saltpetre\r\nCommittee; his position was recognised by the\r\nSupreme Government of Chili. The Association was\r\nofficially recognised as a corporate body, and registered\r\nby the name of 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero.' In March following it",
  "p3330.png": "was settled and promulgated that for the remainder of the\r\nyear--viz., from the 1st April to 31st December--only\r\n25 per cent. of the full capable production should be elaborated,\r\nreserving the right for the Committee to alter this\r\nquota if desirable in the interests of the Combination, by\r\ngiving thirty days' notice. The oficinas which elaborated\r\nnitrate during the month of November were allowed to\r\nelaborate 30 per cent. from the 1st April to 31st December.\r\nDuring May, 1885, the 'Juneta Directiva' were increased\r\nin number from 9 to 11; the Vice-President retired. Also\r\nthe number of Comision de Peritos were increased in a\r\nsimilar manner, and delegates from Valparaiso were\r\naccredited to the 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero' of Iquique. About the\r\nsame time the sum of \u00a32,000 was appropriated to be spent\r\nin the United States of America, advertising the innumerable\r\nbenefits that nitrate would bestow on the agriculture of\r\nthat Republic. The proceedings of the 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero'\r\nhave been carried out with dignity and judgment. To a\r\nperson not resident in Iquique it is difficult to realise the\r\npower which the 'Comit\u00e9 Salitreros' possess. Firstly, they\r\nhave the support and are recognised as a corporate body\r\nby the Republic. Secondly, the object of the combination,\r\nthe banking interest, and of all trade depending on the\r\nmanufacture of nitrate, are so closely bound together,\r\nthat a fiat issued with regard to any firm or individual\r\nwho has persistently offended against the Articles of\r\nAssociation means to them immediate ruin. The firm or\r\nindividual is treated as one whose signature is not worth\r\nthe paper it is written upon; he or they are in every form of\r\nthe word boycotted. One individual, after fair warning by\r\nthe 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero,' was placed in the condition I have\r\ndescribed. Quite lately, another very strong firm informed\r\nthe Committee that they should not conform with the",
  "p3340.png": "Articles of the Association after the end of 1885. This\r\nrather staggered them, but it was shown to this firm that\r\nthe 'Comit\u00e9 Salitrero' were a unanimous body, and the firm\r\nafterwards recanted. Thirdly, they have in a great measure\r\nchecked the erection of new plant, as since 1884 oficinas of\r\na capable capacity of only 3,830,000 quintals have been\r\nestablished. Just at present the world does not consume\r\nmore than 17,000,000 quintals yearly. It may require\r\nmore when the \u00a32,000 has fixed definitely in the minds of\r\nthe intelligent American farmer the wonderful effect of\r\nnitrate of soda.

It is obvious that the interest of\r\nthe Government in collecting as much revenue as possible\r\nfrom the exportation of nitrate does not accord with that of\r\nthe manufacturers. When the manufacturers restrain the\r\noutput and the shipments they touch the treasury of the\r\nState, which does not pay much regard to the profits of the\r\noficinas.  The latter naturally seek to keep the prices of\r\n\r\n* But England must set the example.",

It is equally obvious that a policy of\r\ngive and take should be followed on both sides.[*] If the small\r\noficinas are crushed out of existence by low prices the\r\nsupply of nitrate of soda will be, pro tanto, diminished;\r\nand if they insisted on the manufacturers sending down\r\ntheir nitrate to the coast and shipping it irrespective of\r\nconsequences, the Government of Chile would deliver a\r\nheavy blow, and cause great discouragement to capitalists.\r\nThe Chilian Government has at present no \"peritos,\" but\r\nthere is an Inspector-General of Nitrate Works, with extensive\r\npowers. There is a feeling--or there was when I was\r\nin Chile--that the Government of the day were exerting\r\nundue pressure on the Nitrate Railway Company to force\r\nit to lower its tariff, and thus to stimulate the produce of\r\nthe oficinas. It is plain that, though in one sense they are\r\napparently antagonistic, the interests of the Railway Company\r\nand the nitrate manufacturers are really indissoluble.\r\nThey are one and indivisible. Whatever affects the prosperity\r\nof one will injure that of the other; and having\r\nregard to the conditions of the nitrate trade itself, and of\r\nthe traffic of the Railway, it is manifest that great care\r\nshould be taken not to disturb the just equilibrium between\r\nproduction and demand on the Pampas by external agency.\r\n\r\nThe Nitrate Railway Company have established a scale\r\nof charges for goods and passenger traffic under State supervision\r\nwhich I, as an outsider, consider reasonable. But\r\nthe constant change in the value of the dollar renders a\r\njust estimate of the rates by no means easy. Originally,\r\nthe cost of carriage of nitrate of soda was fixed at 1-1/2 cents.\r\n\r\n* As an instance of the value of the Nitrate trade to Chile I may mention\r\nthat Colonel North was paying export duty on nitrate of soda from his oficina\r\nto the amount of \u00a31,000 a day--in round numbers, \u00a3350,000 per annum.",

If\r\nthe Railway Company find it difficult, under present circumstances\r\nand conditions, to complete the whole of the\r\nTarapac\u00e1 system and to pay a fair dividend to the shareholders,\r\nthey would certainly collapse if the Chilian Government,\r\nfor the sake of a temporary increase of the revenue\r\nderived from the duty, allowed rail or tramways to be laid\r\nto all the oficinas over the Pampas to carry their Nitrate,\r\nand the Republic of Chile itself would feel, sooner or later,\r\nthe impolicy of controlling the action of the manufacturers\r\nin the production of Nitrate of Soda and of dealing a\r\ndeadly blow at the railway by which it has secured such\r\ngreat advantages.\r\n\r\nThe English companies make more than one-half of all\r\nthe nitrate in Tarapac\u00e1.

It was dissolved in 1887, but it is\r\nfelt, in the face of the general distrust and of the great\r\ndepreciation which menaces the business, that some substitute\r\nmust be selected; or that over-production, competition,\r\nand dissension will work serious injury to the great\r\nnitrate interest, and with it to agricultural progress in\r\nlarge districts in Europe and America.

The buccaneers were\r\noffended by the smell which came from it \"between the\r\nwind and their nobility\" when cruising off the rocky shores\r\nof Peru, and it is stated in one of the earliest accounts of\r\ntravel in those parts that the deposit of the sea-birds (to\r\nwhich the name of \"guano\" appears to have been given\r\nfrom the islands chiefly affected by them) was used by the\r\nIndians to enrich the soil. The Nitrate of Soda on the\r\nhigh plateaux of the Andes was not known so early, and\r\ndid not come till recently into competition with guano, as\r\nan article of commerce of immense utility to the agriculturist,\r\nto be sought for in the rainless region of Tarapac\u00e1\r\nand exported thence to all parts of the world. But it is\r\nvery probable indeed that hundreds of years before Nitrate",
  "p3390.png": "of Soda became an article of commerce largely imported\r\ninto Europe, the people living in the valleys of the Andes\r\nwere acquainted with its value, and that it was worked on\r\nthe Pampas in a rude kind of way and transported to\r\nBolivia and the adjacent cultivated districts for the purpose\r\nof increasing the native crops.\r\n\r\nThe pampas of Tamarugal are covered in places with the\r\nruins of the works erected in the early days before foreign\r\ncapital and science were brought to bear upon the operations\r\nof the manufacture, and speedily put an end to the\r\nparadas system which died out after a few short years of\r\nstruggling and suffering. The old pots of iron and copper,\r\nthe brick piers and fireplaces, and the walls of the cabins\r\nwhere the people carried on these nitrate works, are still\r\nto be seen. The fondas or pots, each of which contained\r\n100 gallons of water and caliche, were suspended between\r\npiers of adobe over fires, the material for which was furnished\r\nby partly fossilized wood found in the pampas,[*] and\r\nwhen the contents were boiled they were tilted over into\r\npans to precipitate the nitrate of soda. The extraction of\r\nthe nitrate from the caliche was imperfect; and the refuse\r\nround these old oficinas sometimes yields nitrate in sufficient\r\nquantity to pay for the cost of extracting it.\r\n\r\nModern chemists have determined with accuracy the\r\ngeneral results to be obtained by the use of artificial\r\nmanures, and the manner in which manure increases the\r\nproduce of the soil. The land is so exceedingly fertile\r\nthat artificial manures have not been much sought after in\r\nthe valleys and the watered plains of Chile, but where they\r\nhave been employed it has been shown that the richest\r\nground was improved. Recent researches by scientific\r\n\r\n* There are still patches of forest left, and it is believed that there was a\r\nperiod when the pampas were covered with timber.",
  "p3400.png": "chemists and agriculturists have proved that Nitrate of\r\nSoda is generally of extraordinary value, but it does not\r\nfollow that its beneficial effects are uniform, or that great\r\nresults can be obtained from the use of the salt in all cases.\r\nMuch discredit has attached to Nitrate of Soda because it\r\ndid not answer the extravagant expectations of those who\r\nemployed it without reference to the conditions of the\r\nground or the nature of the crop. Few English agriculturists\r\nare willing to enter on experimental courses which\r\ncost money, but the application of Nitrate of Soda to\r\nland for certain crops cannot be included in the category\r\nof experiment at all--the result is certain. Some farmers\r\nwho tried Nitrate upon clover, peas, &c., and discovered\r\nthat their pains and their money were wasted, denounced\r\nthe use of it, and laid the blame due to their own ignorance\r\nat the door of the salt. But others, having found that\r\nturnips, potatoes, corn, &c., responded to the touch of\r\nNitrate in exact proportion to the quantity of the manure,\r\nbecame alarmed when they were assured that they were\r\nexhausting the land, without taking the trouble to ascertain\r\nwhether the statement was true or not.\r\n\r\nThe British farmer, conservative to the core, was with\r\ndifficulty induced to resort to guano at first, but when he\r\nhad once taken to it his faith was steadfast. Phosphates\r\nand nitrates scarcely shook his belief in the virtue of his\r\nold friend when they came into the field, and it was only\r\nwhen he saw what those farmers who were bold enough\r\nto invest in the new fertilizer, Nitrate of Soda, got for\r\ntheir money, that he could be induced to look at it. And\r\nthen it was only askant. \"The price was,\" he said, \"a\r\nformidable obstacle to any lavish purchase of the new\r\nmanure, no matter what results the use of it gave!\"\r\nManufacturers in Chile say the English farmer dislikes",

There is, as I have said, an idea in England, for\r\nwhich there is no solid foundation whatever, that Nitrate of\r\nSoda exhausts the soil. I have heard the statement made\r\nby gentlemen who never used an ounce of it. One of\r\nmy friends said he had tried it in Lincolnshire, and that\r\nit had produced a good crop, but that he \"did not think\r\nit did so well the next time, therefore he had given it up\r\naltogether!\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most curious of the problems connected\r\nwith the study of our agricultural system to understand\r\nwhy the English farmer, who is always struggling, he\r\nsays, with adverse circumstances, domestic and foreign,\r\nscarcely deigns to use Nitrate of Soda, whilst the agricultural\r\nclasses on the Continent, where the farmers certainly\r\nare not rich, use it in hundreds and thousands of tons.\r\nThe retail dealers ought to sell Nitrate of Soda and make a\r\nfair profit, at \u00a311 a ton,[*] and 1 cwt. of Nitrate is found to\r\nbe a stimulating and sufficient dressing for one acre of land!\r\n\r\nBefore it was dissolved the Comit\u00e9 Salitrero issued an\r\ninvitation to scientific agriculturists, chemists and others\r\nto compete for very handsome prizes to be given for the\r\nbest essays of a popular character upon the importance and\r\nvalue of Nitrate of Soda as a manure; the essays to consist\r\nof two parts, one theoretical, dealing with the chemical\r\n\r\n* At the close of 1889 the price of nitrate \"off coast\" was \u00a38 7s. 6d. per ton,\r\nbut it has been falling gradually all the early part of this year, and is now\r\nnearly 20s. lower.",

The\r\nfirst prize was awarded to Dr. Stutzer, president of the\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station at Bonn. The second\r\nprize was given to the essay of Professor Damseaux, of\r\nGembloux. Dr. Stutzer's pamphlet is entitled \"Nitrate of\r\nSoda: Its Importance and Use as a Manure.\" The judges\r\nwho awarded the second prize to Professor Damseaux seem\r\nto have called in the assistance of another expert, Dr.\r\nWagner, professor and president of the agricultural experiment\r\nstation, Darmstadt, who rewrote and edited the prize\r\nessay of Dr. Stutzer.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wagner, agreeing with the chemists and\r\nnaturalists who have conducted experiments on a large\r\nscale, divides plants into \"nitrogen collectors\" and\r\n\"increasers,\" and \"nitrogen eaters.\" He shows how a\r\ngrain of wheat and a pea differ in their early lives--how\r\nthe first lives on the nitrogenous salts which it takes\r\nfrom the soil around it; how the pea, on the other hand,\r\ndoes not find sufficient nitrogen in the soil, but must take\r\nit from the air. If the professor be right, peas, vetches,\r\n&c., largely increase the circulating nitrogen capital of\r\na farm; whilst cereals, potatoes, turnips, carrots, tobacco,\r\nmaize, grass, &c., take the nitrogen they find in the\r\nsoil, and incorporate it in the crops. Those who are interested\r\nin agricultural chemistry can easily test the value",
  "p3430.png": "of Dr. Wagner's experiments. It is for the practical\r\nfarmer to judge, by the colour of the leaves and the appearance\r\nof the plant, when his crops are suffering from\r\nthe want of nitrogen. Crops which draw nitrogen from the\r\nair do not acquire the property of doing so till they have\r\nattained a certain degree of maturity. If there be enough\r\nof nitrogenous matter in the ground it is waste to apply\r\nmore. If, when a plant is sickly, nitrogen, in the form\r\nof Nitrate of Soda, be added to the soil which wants it,\r\nthe leaves soon become green and assume the appearance\r\nof health. Vetches and peas and the like will languish\r\nto the point of death in sand, till they are able to absorb\r\nthe nitrogen of the air. A top-dressing of Nitrate of Soda,\r\nsays Dr. Wagner, strengthens seed sown in autumn, and\r\nassists badly-developed seed, &c., not only in soil which\r\ncontains inconsiderable quantities of, but in one which is\r\nrich in nitrogen. Increased crops are produced by the use\r\nof nitrogen hastening the first development by supplying\r\nits food to the plant.\r\n\r\nThe tables, based upon the results of careful experiment,\r\ngiven in the work of the Darmstadt Professor, show that\r\n18 lbs. of Nitrate to the acre gave an increase of 61 per\r\ncent. of barley, that 45 lbs. of nitrate gave an increase\r\nof 172 per cent., and that wheat and flax were largely\r\ndeveloped, whilst peas and lucerne were not affected to\r\nany appreciable extent. The inference, he says, is that\r\npeas, vetches, lucerne obtain nitrogen where barley, rye,\r\nturnips, carrots, potatoes, flax, oats, &c., are unable to take\r\nnitrogen from the air, and being dependent for it on the\r\nsoil in which they grow, cannot do so unless the latter be\r\nsupplied with it. Potatoes, turnips, flax, rape possess the\r\nsame power of abstraction. In the pamphlet there is an\r\naccount of an interesting little experiment with barren",
  "p3440.png": "sand--\"The sand was put into pots, and provided\r\nwith all the materials necessary for the growth of plants,\r\nnitrogen alone excepted, and barley, rape, vetches, lucerne\r\nand peas were planted. Barley and rape developed so\r\nscantily in this soil, which was almost free from nitrogen,\r\nthat they yielded only from 20 to 35 grains of vegetable\r\nmatter, while, under the same conditions, vetches, lucerne\r\nand peas vegetated very luxuriously, the last-named producing\r\nno less than 1,390 grains of crop. Taking the\r\nnitrogen contained in the yield of barley and rape as 100,\r\nthen, under the very same conditions, the enormous\r\nquantity of 8700 of nitrogen was contained in the crop of\r\npeas.\"\r\n\r\nHere there can be no doubt. Experiment and experience\r\nhave proved that the theories of chemists are correct.\r\nProfessor Wagner puts the matter in a clear light in\r\nthe little pamphlet translated by Mr. Henderson, of\r\nthe University of Glasgow. He says:--\"According to\r\nE. Lierke's[*] new calculations 68 lbs. of nitrogen are\r\ncontained in an average crop of about 2,400 lbs. of\r\noats and 4,000 lbs. of oat-straw. The question now is:\r\nWill a crop of 2,400 lbs. of oats and 4,000 lbs. of oat-straw\r\nbe obtained if the soil contains 68 lbs. of readily\r\nsoluble nitrogen (apart from other nourishment, which\r\nof course must be present in sufficient quantity)? The\r\nanswer is, No. The soil must contain a considerably\r\nlarger amount of nitrogen, because the roots of the oats,\r\nwhich were not included in the above-mentioned crop,\r\nalso require nitrogen, and besides, we cannot reckon\r\non the plant taking up the whole of the easily-soluble\r\nnitrogen which is contained in the soil or added to it by\r\nmanuring with nitrate of soda. In order to produce this\r\n\r\n* E. Lierke's praktische Dungertafel.",
  "p3450.png": "crop, the soil must not contain 68 lbs. but about 100 lbs.\r\nof nitrogen in an easily soluble form. We may count that\r\non the average only two-thirds of the nitrogen supplied\r\nwill be recovered in the crop. Thus, if 100 lbs. of nitrate\r\nof soda are put into the ground, it may be assumed that in\r\nround numbers 10 lbs. of the 15-16 lbs. of nitrogen contained\r\nin the nitrate are employed in producing the crop.\r\nThe next question is, What yield of the different cultivated\r\nplants can be produced from the 10 lbs. of nitrogen?\r\nIt is easy to calculate this. If 68 lbs. of nitrogen are contained\r\nin 2,400 lbs. of oats and 4,000 lbs. of oat-straw,\r\n10 lbs. of nitrogen--as a simple calculation shows--produce\r\n355 lbs. of oats and 585 lbs. of straw, whence it follows\r\nthat manuring with 100 lbs. of nitrate of soda must cause an\r\nincrease of 355 lbs. in the crop of oats, and 585 lbs. in the\r\ncrop of straw. As the average quantity of nitrogen contained\r\nin the produce of all cultivated plants is known, it\r\nis possible to extend the calculation just made for oats to\r\nall other field produce, and to find in this way the average\r\nincrease in the yield which 100 lbs. of nitrate of soda can\r\nproduce.\"[*]\r\n\r\nBut something more conclusive than the \"theories of\r\nphilosophers,\" as I heard one country gentleman denominate\r\nthe hard and exact practical experiments of the experienced\r\ngentlemen who have been recognised as authorities\r\nin the department of scientific agriculture, must be put\r\nunder the farmer's eyes before he will yield to a \"new\r\nfad\"--and the only conclusive argument for him is a\r\nprofitable return for the use of it. But then this Nitrate\r\n\"exhausts the soil,\" he says. \"You must go on giving\r\nmore Nitrate to your land year after year; the toper[**P2: topper?] must\r\nhave larger glasses of stimulant. If Nitrate has been used\r\n\r\n* See Appendix.",
  "p3460.png": "once and a good crop has been raised, the land will give a\r\npoor crop next year\"! There is no truth whatever in the\r\nassertion--it is a theory without fact or philosophy to support\r\nit. The alleged exhaustion can only arise from the\r\nNitrate causing the plant or crop to take more potash and\r\nphosphoric acid out of the soil, in such a way as to prevent\r\ntheir being restored, than would have been the case\r\nhad Nitrate not been used. Most careful experiments in\r\nSaxony with Nitrate on oats have shown that the increased\r\nconsumption of plant food taken by the use of Nitrate\r\nfrom the land is in exact proportion to the increase of the\r\ncrop itself. There is no mystery here. Any farmer can\r\ntry if it is so for himself. He has before him the experiments,\r\nlong continued and careful, of Lawes and Gilbert\r\nto determine whether Nitrate diminishes the fertility of\r\nthe soil in a greater degree than Ammonia, and he can\r\nvery readily test the truth of the statement that the soil\r\nis not actually deteriorated by the Nitrate taking out of\r\nthe ground the nutritive property, and that any exhaustion\r\nin that sense is in proportion to the increase of the crop,\r\nwhich represents, of course, an increased supply of food.\r\n\r\nDr. Stutzer arrived at the conclusion that the soil is not\r\nin the least degree deteriorated by Nitrate; that an increase\r\nis obtained from its use not only in the amount of straw, but\r\nin the weight of grain; that if attention be paid to the nature\r\nof the soil and the quantity of nitrogen in it, there is always\r\na good return to be had in all cereals, potatoes, beetroot,\r\nturnips, &c., from Nitrate; that on light sandy soil it has as\r\ngood an effect as Sulphate of Ammonia; that it can be\r\nused in autumn as well as in the spring, but that it should\r\nnot be employed in meadows, and that peas, vetches, clover,\r\n&c., carrots, parsnips, kohlrabbi, do not yield a profitable\r\nreturn from the use of it.",
  "p3470.png": "\r\nIf the farmer takes a bag of Nitrate powdered, or as it is\r\nimported, and, without regard to the nature of the soil or the\r\ncrop, spreads it indiscriminately over his land, he may be\r\ndisappointed. But it is surely worth while for him to try,\r\non the authority of such men as Lawes and Gilbert, whether\r\nby the use of 1-1/2cwt. of Nitrate he can obtain an increase of\r\n369lbs. of corn, and of 462lbs. of straw per acre. They state\r\nthat they obtained by the use of that quantity of Nitrate\r\nan increase of 5,888lbs. in roots, and all through the long\r\nseries of their experiments they noted most beneficial results\r\nfrom the use of Nitrate of Soda. It may be true that\r\nwe have no sufficient data to enable us to determine with\r\ncertainty what results may be always expected from Nitrate,\r\nbut the experiments referred to show that it gives an\r\nincrease of 3-1/3cwt. in rye, of 7cwt. in oats, and of 16-1/2cwt.\r\nin oat straw in comparison with Ammonia. With wheat\r\nand barley the results were equally definite. When the\r\nNitrate is worked into the ground the quality of potatoes\r\nis much improved. Sulphate of Ammonia is inferior,\r\nas a fertilizer, to Nitrate of Soda, especially in the case\r\nof beetroots, potatoes, cereals, and grapes.\r\n\r\nNitrate of Soda was exported for the first time in 1830,\r\nwhen 18,700 quintals of it--the quintal being roughly\r\n101 lbs.--were shipped at Iquique, and the export trade\r\nhad been going on there for five years when Darwin visited\r\nthe port. It was at first, as we see, a very insignificant\r\ntrade--less than 150 tons a year. Still the demand was\r\nstimulating supply, and the Pampas was becoming an\r\nobject of interest to travellers and of wealth to the\r\npeople. In his \"Journal of Researches,\" new edition,\r\np. 363, Darwin, describing his visit to the Salinas from\r\nIquique, says:--\r\n\r\n\"We did not reach the saltpetre works till after sunset.[**, ?]",

It lies\r\nclose beneath the surface, and follows for a length of one\r\nhundred and fifty miles the margin of a grand basin or\r\nplain; this, from its outline, manifestly must once have\r\nbeen a lake, or more probably, an inland arm of the sea,\r\nas may be inferred from the presence of iodic salts in the\r\nsaline stratum. The surface of the plain is 3,300 feet\r\nabove the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the difficulties in the\r\nconveyance of the Nitrate from the factories on the Pampas\r\nto the port of Iquique were very great, and that the cost\r\nof the Nitrate was handicapping the export. But in 1840\r\nit increased from the insignificant total first quoted to\r\n1,095,572 quintals. That quantity was tripled between\r\n1840 and 1850. The decade 1850-1860 witnessed an\r\nincrease in like proportion. In the ten years from 1860 to\r\n1869, the export was 17,572,486 quintals. In 1867,\r\n13,000 tons were landed in Hamburg, in 1881, 96,700\r\ntons, and a corresponding increase took place generally at\r\nthe other European ports.[*]\r\n\r\nThe exports from Peru increased by leaps and bounds\r\n\r\n* See Appendix, Returns.",

The imports of Nitrate by the United\r\nKingdom increased, however, between 1880 and 1890 very\r\nslowly, and the ratio shown in the figures between foreign\r\nand home use of Nitrate is very significant. It must be\r\nremembered that much of the Nitrate entered for United\r\nKingdom ports is sent to await instructions, and that a\r\nlarge proportion of the cargoes is sent abroad on order.\r\n\r\nThe exchange at the close of last year was 25-1/2 (2s. 1-1/2d.).\r\nThere were 100,000 tons to be shipped in December,\r\nleaving only 24,000 tons of shipping in the Nitrate ports\r\nof Chile; but the price was still quoted at $2\u00b750, and the",

Antwerp, Ostend,\r\nHamburg, Dunkirk, Brest, Havre, Bordeaux take far more\r\nthan London, Liverpool, Newcastle-on-Tyne, or Glasgow.\r\nIn July, 1889, 22,087 quintals were exported to England,\r\n223,894 quintals to Germany, 57,262 quintals to the\r\nMediterranean, and 769,741 quintals were shipped on order\r\nfor England or the Continent.

  "p3610.png": "direction from the Central Station, and which has just been\r\ndetailed are those of Sebastopol (not yet complete), Paposa,\r\nPernana, Sacramento, San Pedro, San Fernando; then, on the\r\nSanta Elena branch, Solferino, Argentina, San Pablo, Virginia,\r\nand Santa Elena; and on the Solidad District branch, San\r\nJuan de Gildemeister, Esmeralda, and San Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that it is from or near Virginia\r\n(48 miles from Iquique) that it is proposed to extend the\r\nrailway to Lagunas.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Central Station and taking the northerly\r\nline of the railway, the first station reached is Monte Video,\r\nwhich is 36-1/2 miles from Iquique, and is the highest point on\r\nthe railways, being 3,811 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe only nitrate oficina between the Central Station and\r\nMonte Video is that called Yungay Bajo.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Monte Video the line descends, and seven miles\r\nbeyond that place is the important station of Pozo de Almonte\r\n(3,371 feet above the sea), near which are grouped the oficinas\r\nBuen Retiro, Calacala, La Palma, of Gibbs & Co., Pe\u00f1a Chica,\r\nand San Jos\u00e9, and from Pozo de Almonte there is also a branch\r\nor siding to the other oficinas called Serena, Normandia,\r\nTegethoff.\r\n\r\nAt Pozo de Almonte there is a workshop for minor repairs,\r\nand it is also a station for engines--besides being the dep\u00f4t\r\nfor the traffic to and from the oficinas just named, and others\r\nmore remote along the line to Pisagua.\r\n\r\nAt Pozo de Almonte there are wells which supply the railway\r\nwith water; the quality of this water is inferior, and before\r\nbeing used for steaming purposes is subjected to a purifying\r\nprocess; the purifier used is unrefined carbonate of soda, which\r\nbeing mixed with the well water and the latter treated, causes\r\na partial precipitation of the carbonate of lime and other substances\r\nin solution, thus leaving the water in a state in which\r\nit can be used for locomotives, though the precipitation not\r\nbeing complete the water still remains of a most unsatisfactory\r\nquality, and after being used a short time leaves a hard shell-*like\r\ndeposit or scale in the boilers of the engines.\r\n\r\nThe purified water is also pumped from Pozo de Almonte\r\nthrough a line of pipes to tanks at Monte Video, and from\r\nthence it runs down to the Central Station, the pipes being\r\ncontinued thus far.",
  "p3620.png": "\r\nFrom the Central Station the same water is run in car tanks\r\ndown the line as far as Las Carpas, whence a line of pipes\r\nconducts it to Santa Rosa, so that at present it will be seen the\r\ninferior water from Pozo de Almonte is supplied to a considerable\r\nsection of the Iquique line.\r\n\r\nThe Tarapac\u00e1 Water Company is laying a line of pipes from\r\nPica, some 30 miles distant in the interior from La Noria, and\r\n60 miles from Iquique, where there is an abundant supply of\r\nexcellent water. The line of pipes will feed the Iquique railway,\r\nas the water will run through La Noria and along or near the\r\nrailway line to Iquique; besides which, a branch pipe will carry\r\nthe water to Pozo de Almonte, and thus do away with the\r\nuse of the existing wells. The branch pipe line to Pozo is\r\nalready laid, and in a short time a regular supply of Pica water\r\nmay be expected there.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of Pozo de Almonte well water now used is\r\nabout 50,000 gallons a day.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Pozo de Almonte the railway gradually rises,\r\nuntil it attains a height of 3,752 feet above the sea at Primitiva,\r\n71 miles from Iquique, whence the descent begins, until at the\r\n\"Nivel\" (or \"Level\") Station, 105 miles from Iquique, the\r\nheight of the railway is 3,610 feet above the sea; the drop is\r\nthen more rapid, and at the Cuesta del Arenal, 114 miles from\r\nIquique, the height above the sea is 2,067 feet; at the Hospicio,\r\nor first cliff above Pisagua, 119 miles from Iquique, it is 1,200\r\nfeet, and thence in 6 miles the railway descends to the sea at\r\nPisagua. The length of the railway from Iquique to Pisagua is\r\n125 miles. The total length of the railways, including sidings\r\nand branches is (May, 1889) 230\u00b746 miles.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Pozo de Almonte, the railway runs past several\r\noficinas already enumerated, and at a distance of 55 miles from\r\nIquique reaches the station of San Donato, near which is the\r\noficina called Ramirez, belonging to the Liverpool Nitrate\r\nCompany, and that of Mr. J. Devesconi, called Constancia.\r\n\r\nThe next station is Huara, 64 miles from Iquique, near\r\nwhich are the establishments called Santa Rosa de Huara,\r\nRosario de Huara, San Jorje, and Tres Marias.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of 71 miles from Iquique are the station and\r\noficina of Primitiva, and from that point the Pisagua Section\r\nmay be said to begin; for though \"Tres Marias\" is the official\r\ndividing point, some traffic for Primitiva is brought to Iquique,",
  "p3630.png": "and beyond that place it is carried (it may be said) exclusively\r\nto Pisagua.\r\n\r\nAfter Primitiva comes the station of Negreiros, 76-1/2 miles\r\nfrom Iquique; and this is the focus for the oficinas Progress,\r\nMercedes, Amelia, and Aurora, as well as for those lying on\r\nthe branch line, which here juts out and connects the station\r\nof Negreiros and the main line with Salvadora, Democracia,\r\nPuntun chasa (London Nitrate Company), Rosario de Negreiros,\r\nand Agua Santa.\r\n\r\nAlthough Agua Santa is connected by a branch with the\r\nNitrate Railways, the traffic to and from that establishment is\r\ncarried in carts to Cal\u00e9ta Buena, where is an inclined plane and\r\nsteam lift for lowering and hoisting to and from the sea shore.\r\nAt Cal\u00e9ta Buena is an anchorage for ships, so that the Agua\r\nSanta business is carried on independently of Iquique and\r\nPisagua.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Negreiros, the first station is Santa Catalina,\r\n87 miles, with the oficinas Reducto, Concepcion, Aguada,\r\nBearnes, and Camina, as also on a branch line those of Angela,\r\nof Messrs. Loayza & Pascal, and of La Patria, of Messrs. Gibbs\r\nand Company (now Tamarugal Nitrate Company).\r\n\r\nThe next station to Santa Catalina is Dolores, 91 miles from\r\nIquique. From Dolores there is a branch line to the oficinas\r\nLa Union and Santa Rita, and adjacent to the station are also\r\nthe establishments called San Francisco and San Patricio, and\r\nat a little distance Carolina, which last is not connected as yet\r\nwith the railway, and the traffic of which is worked to and from\r\nthe small port of Junin by carts.\r\n\r\nAt Dolores are wells of good fresh water, which is used as\r\nwell for drinking as for the locomotives. Water is here pumped\r\ninto an elevated tank, from which it runs in pipes to the\r\nstations of Zapiga and Nivel, and, indeed, as far down towards\r\nthe port as the Cuesta del Arenal. The quantity of Dolores\r\nwater used on the railway is about 24,000 gallons a day.\r\n\r\nThe station following Dolores is Zapiga, 94 miles from\r\nIquique, near which are the oficinas Sacramento de Zapiga,\r\nSan Jos\u00e9 del Rosario, Cruz de Zapiga, Compania, Matamungi\r\n(not working), and San Antonio (not working).\r\n\r\nThere are an engine-house and workshop at Zapiga, which is\r\na very important station on the Pisagua side, and serves as a\r\ndep\u00f4t for up and down traffic.",
  "p3640.png": "\r\nAfter Zapiga station comes that of Jaz Pampa, 101 miles\r\nfrom Iquique, which name is also given to the adjoining oficina\r\nof Messrs. North and Company. Close to Jaz Pampa a branch\r\nlately constructed runs to the new oficina, called Paccha, also\r\nbelonging to Messrs. North and Company.\r\n\r\nAfter Paccha there are no oficinas; the next station towards\r\nPisagua is called the Nivel (Level), 105 miles from Iquique and\r\n20 from Pisagua. It is an important station in the working of\r\nthe line, serving as a dep\u00f4t, watering place, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nFrom the Nivel station the railway rapidly descends to\r\nPisagua, passing the station of San Roberto, and the stopping\r\nplaces of Cuesta del Arenal and Hospicio. At the Cuesta del\r\nArenal are some large rock cuttings worthy of notice, and the\r\ngradients to Pisagua vary between 2\u00b770 and 4\u00b773 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom the Hospicio the railway zigzags down to the sea shore\r\nat Pisagua; there being three reversing points between the two\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nNote, page 59.\r\n\r\nAccording to recent scientific travellers, it is in the latitude\r\nof Coquimbo that the distinctive members of the flora of Chile\r\npresent themselves. Between the desert--where rain in a\r\nmeasurable quantity is unknown--and the southern forest-belt\r\nextending from Magellan to Valdivia, Central Chile has a long,\r\ndry, and rainless summer, followed by an autumn and spring in\r\nwhich rain falls scantily; but there are exceptions every four or\r\nfive years, particularly after severe earthquakes, and then the\r\nconsequences are by no means beneficial. The rainfall here and\r\nat Copiapo is 4 or 5 inches a year. In the central section of\r\nChile about 30 inches fall; in the lake region from 60 to 80.\r\nIn the island of Chiloe and in Valdivia the rain may be said to\r\nbe perennial, \"thirteen months in the year,\" as one writer has\r\nit. We arrived in Chile in the autumn--that is, in the month\r\nof March--and were there for the rest of that season. The winter\r\nbegins in June and lasts till the end of August, and in the first\r\nof these months we were at Iquique and on the Pampas, therefore\r\nwe escaped the summer; but after all the mean temperature\r\nis 70\u00b0 F. in summer and 52\u00b0 in winter, being 5\u00b0 hotter than\r\nthe average in Paris or London, and 9\u00b0 warmer in winter.",

It was then\r\nabout ten times the present price, but it is now so very cheap--5d.\r\nan ounce, I believe--though the nitrate manufacturers some\r\ntime ago formed a combination to restrict the output, that the\r\nprofits have been reduced. In some nitrate grounds the amount\r\nof iodine in the caliche is so small that it is scarcely worth\r\nextracting, but that circumstance is not necessarily indicative\r\nof a serious deterioration in the quantity or quality of the\r\ncaliche.\r\n\r\nThe \"Iodine house\" is a huit clos, and each oficina has its\r\nlittle secret in some detail or another, but the principle of\r\nthe manufacture is common to all. The iodine is contained in\r\ncaliche as iodate of soda, varying very greatly in quantity, the\r\nmaximum reaching 50 per cent. It is taken up in the mother-*water,\r\nor agua vieja, which plays such an important part in\r\nnitrate oficinas. Caliche has, as a normal rate, 50 per cent. of\r\nnitrate of soda, 26 per cent. of chloride of soda, 6 per cent. of\r\nsulphate of soda, 3 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, 15 per\r\ncent. of insoluble matter, but iodine in the form mentioned\r\nenters largely into the ingredients of it at some places.\r\n\r\nAt the Peruana oficina the mother-liquor contains 28 per\r\ncent. of nitrate of soda, 11 per cent. of chloride, 3 per cent. of\r\nsulphate, 3 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, 22 per cent. of\r\niodate of soda, 33 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nWhen iodate of soda is contained in sufficient quantities in\r\nthe agua vieja of the caliche to make it profitable to extract\r\nthe iodine, the latter is precipitated from the solution by an\r\nacid sulphite of soda made on the spot. Nitrate of soda and",

Liquid carbonate of soda is formed by\r\nthe combustion, and is run into a pit at the base of the devil,\r\nwhere it cools and hardens into the substance called sal natron.\r\nThis carbonate of soda is then dissolved in water, and is exposed\r\nin closed vessels to the fumes of sulphur, in combination with\r\nwhich it forms acid sulphite of soda.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of practical knowledge is necessary to\r\nascertain the proportion in which the sulphite should be put\r\ninto the agua vieja to precipitate the iodine.\r\n\r\nThe acid sulphite of soda and agua vieja are mixed together\r\nby paddles driven by steam or by manual labour in the precipitating\r\ntanks. The liquid turns from its original orange to\r\nblue, and gradually deposits iodine at the bottom of the tank.\r\nThis deposit of crude iodine, with the result of a filtration of\r\nthe liquor in the tank (which is now called agua malo), through\r\nsieves, is put into an iron vessel and pressed into cakes, which\r\nare finally put into a retort and sublimed. The iodine of commerce\r\nappears in the form of crystals. They are collected and\r\npacked in barrels, containing about 33 lbs., which are made airtight\r\nby coatings of tar and raw hide. When the agua vieja\r\nhas given up all its iodine, it is drawn off to the tanks, where it\r\nbecomes again charged with caliche.\r\n\r\nNote, page 252.\r\n\r\nA traveller is always received in the house of a Chilian, and\r\nis welcome to food and shelter, but their hospitality is not\r\ngratuitous.

Arica\r\nexisted as an Indian town many years before the discovery of\r\nAmerica. It received the title of city from the Spaniards in\r\n1537. The Chilian Government may prefer to have a claim\r\nagainst Peru and let Arica \"slide,\" but if they desire to retain\r\nthe department of Arica and the province of Tacna, of which\r\nArica is the port, it is thought that they may effect their object,\r\nnotwithstanding the numerical ascendency of the Peruvians.\r\nThere are ways of doing these things, and all the Peruvians\r\nhere are not devoted to the distracted Republic north of the\r\nChilian frontier. The comparison of Tacna-Arica to Alsace-Lorraine\r\ndoes not hold good, because there is no virtue in a\r\nplebiscite to deliver the French provinces from the grip of\r\nGermany, and no equity of redemption in the case.\r\n\r\nNote, page 337.\r\n\r\nMr. Markham states that the nitrate fields defined up to\r\n1882 covered 50 square leagues, which, allowing one cwt.\r\nof nitrate for every square yard, would give 63 million tons.\r\nSince that time the area has been much extended.

A greater increase in the crop\r\nof one fruit may often yield a considerably smaller profit from\r\nmanuring with nitrate than a smaller increase in the crop of\r\nanother. It depends upon the market value of the produce.\r\n\r\n\"If we assume the following to be the prices of 100 lbs. of\r\neach of the substances named, viz., hay, 1s. 6d.; rape-seed, 9s.;\r\ncattle turnips, 6d.; corn, 5s. 6d.; straw, 1s. 2d.; beet-roots, 9d.;\r\nand poppy-seed, 27s., we can calculate from the weight of produce\r\ngiven in the table above, which could be produced by 100\r\nlbs. of nitrate of soda, the following values:--\r\n\r\nHay =    15 shillings\r\nRape-seed =    19 \"\r\nCattle-turnips =    21 \" and six pence\r\nCorn + Straw =    27 \"\r\nBeet-roots =    32 \" and nine pence\r\nPoppy-seed =    46 \" \" three pence",
  "p3720.png": "\r\n\"This shows how great the differences are in the profits obtained\r\nby manuring with nitrogen, and how remunerative it is\r\nto manure freely with nitrogen and so force on to the greatest\r\npossible productiveness those plants in particular which yield\r\nmarket produce of high value.\r\n\r\n\"But from the figures given a very considerable profit from\r\nmanuring with nitrogen can be estimated even for the produce\r\nwhich is at present low in price, corn, straw, and beet-roots, for,\r\nfrom manurings with 100 lbs. of nitrate, sums of from 27s. to\r\n32s. can be obtained, while that amount of nitrate can be bought\r\nfor from 9s. to 11s. 6d.\"\r\n\r\nNote, page 350.\r\n\r\nEXPORTS OF NITRATE FOR SEPTEMBER, 1889.\r\n\r\nEUROPE--\r\n\r\nEngland 18,368\r\nFrance 282,456\r\nGermany 378,852\r\nBelgium 40,110\r\nOrders U.K. or Continent 1,199,052\r\n\r\n1,918,838\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES 79,060\r\n\r\nQuintals 1,997,898\r\n\r\nEXPORTS FOR OCTOBER, 1889.\r\n\r\nEUROPE--\r\n\r\nFrance 261,474\r\nGermany 844,851\r\nBelgium 27,176\r\nMediterranean 35,286\r\nOrders U.K. or Continent 1,250,976\r\n\r\n2,419,763\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES 188,822\r\nS.A.
